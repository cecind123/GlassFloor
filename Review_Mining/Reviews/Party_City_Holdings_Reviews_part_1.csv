rating,review
bad,"Terrible company, you‚Äôre underpaid and overworked and they treat all employees poorly! High turnover rate, customers get frustrated because of the negative environment and lack of teamwork and positivity, if you are treated terrible by management no one cares not even the GMüòî."
bad,"I had to go to school that‚Äôs why I quit but party city wasn‚Äôt bad at all good working environment pretty peaceful, so it‚Äôs not bad at all so if you looking to work go ahead"
bad,They dont care about you and most of the employees make fun of you for not knowing stuff. No training at all. They want you to know everything from start. They're sexiest making women work register and men in back. They wont allow men up front because we dont attract customers.
bad,Fun place to work friendly co-workers very busy during the holidays especially during Halloween if you like hosting or throwing parties it's nice to see the new stuff
bad,"It was definitely a good old boys club in Senior Leadership  "
bad,"From my first day to my last, management road me. i have over 27 years experience and management there had less than 10... due to their lack of experience they have made bad choices with design, applications and infrastructure.. When i pointed out all these holes in design and security I was forced out... Never work for a retail company! standards and security mean nothing to them its all about profits not the employees..."
bad,This job sucks terrible pay and no hours would not recommend this job to anyone because u can move up To a lead position and only make 1 $extra like that is horrible
bad,this was a great after school job. it is great if you are looking for something while in school. I would not suggest trying to live off of the hourly rate.
bad,Company expects things to be done  but does not give enough manpower to compete task. They don't  care about the employees just their bonus. Upper management have their clicks
bad,"It was my first job, great for high school grads with no work experience. It will make you a better person and you will not become a shopzilla wanting to see everyone's manager. Get in and get out. You're a number not a person to the company."
bad,"If you want a manager that doesn‚Äôt care about your flexibility or you at all, then work here. We dont get paid enough to deal with the customers there  they are a whole different breed"
bad,Highly toxic environment. Not worth the pay or the stress. Health care is horrible and expensive. Cashiers are lucky to get 20hrs/week at minimum wage during non-peak seasons (so outside October).
bad,"They are very unorganized, they care for the customers I worked there during Halloween worst job ever they want all employees to clean up the whole store every night knowing it‚Äôs only 7 of us"
bad,Don‚Äôt know about other locations but the St. Clairsville one should be avoided at all costs. The store manager does not do their job but expects everyone else to do their jobs to the max. The district management and HR lets them get away with everything as they have been reported on numerous occasions and nothing has been done.
bad,1 day work week hrs and management very bad store is bad place to work. Store is never clean don't no work hrs bad place if u looking to live off of management gets all the hrs while associate get non at all unfair place to work
bad,Party City does not care about it's employees. Often times you wonder how the managers made it so far into the company. Corporate hires everyone from failed company's to run stores and they expect them to keep this company afloat. It's terrible.
bad,"Working there sucks.  they are closing no point in applying or having any future with the company, don't listen to employees. I only work there to help my friend"
bad,"No matter how hard I worked, or how good I was with customers it was never enough. Doing everything to get a promotion and doing all the right things got me nowhere. I wasted an entire year of my life there."
bad,I was general manager. I had very poor upper management no. work between 15 to 18 hrs per day for 28+ days long! Until I was injured no workers comp!!
bad,Corporate makes this company unbearable to work for with their unrealistic expectations of employees. They‚Äôd cut hours and still expect us to get an unreasonable amount of work done in an unrealistic time frame with one associate and manager. I like who I work with just not the Dm and up in the company. They don‚Äôt know what working in their stores is really like to set the goals they make for us.
bad,"Recieved hateful comments about my disabilities, wasn't properly trained, when told to stay at regrister even when slow I was called ""retarted"" & they told me they were going to fire me if I didnt ""pick up the pace"". Each store is different & the managers aren't the same, but the Party City on Dixie Highway was unacceptable."
bad,"Unfortunately the senior leadership had no idea how to run an effective retail company."
bad,"This is a terribly run company. Poor management, no common sense. They promote people with no experience nor do they actually train anyone. Hours and pay are awful. A total mess."
bad,"Manager at party city. nothing really bad to say, it was a J.O.B. "
bad,"While working here for over three years, stayed full time, stayed at eight dollars a hour. Would not recommend anyone to work here. This place is a joke."
bad,"I really did not enjoy working there, it was super boring and frustrating dealing with the management. I would not recommend working here because eventually they will go out of business."
bad,Treats their employees horribly. Screws up pay all the time!!!!! Takes off breaks off pay but don‚Äôt let you take breaks! Management is ridiculous and does not care about their employee.
bad,i personally didnt like my job experience the managers were very rude and act as i i was a child and i personally didnt appreciate it not onr bit ill never work there again
bad,The Management team doesn‚Äôt do anything when there is a problem going on in store. There are multiple things that could change to make Party City a better corporation.
bad,I worked for party city for 7 years and worked my way up to assistant manager. I was fired in the day my daughter was born. Worked over 60 hours a week during Halloween without any overtime pay.
bad,Party City has a terrible work life balance. There is very limited payroll and the District Manager expects the general manager to work on their personal time to complete any tasks not possible with the hours given. If you do not work atleast 1 day per week for extra you will never succeed. Overall a horrible place to work unless you like working unpaid for many many hours!!
bad,"The job it self is great, but the store management it's awful and sometimes irresponsible. If you make a mistake sometimes, they can treat the employee harshly and unfairly."
bad,"Cashier, customer service, cleaning, inventory and also stocking."
bad,Owner of he company runs the company when he feels like it. No evals or raise in over 3 years. No 401k program and only medical insurance if offered but very expensive. No leadership and no training programs at all.
bad,horrible place to work the general manager in store number 1124 was the most horrible to work under she was always coming and going when she wanted. She was late every morning even on shifts where she was the only keyholder and had associates would have to wait.
bad,"Garbage place to work. Higher management sucks and only gives good hours to favorites. Most people don‚Äôt do absolutely anything all day long while you break your back to get stuff done. Seriously horrible (especially during the holidays). Also, district manager is nuts and annoying"
bad,I do not recommend this company. It‚Äôs basically falling apart. No communication between departments at HQ and nothing is trickled down. 6 DMs in 5 years. Micro managers and work 50-80 hours a week.  The norm is definitely the higher side!
bad,I still currently work with party city and looking for a better job they are rude and not understanding have no communication with co workers I wouldn't recommend them to anyone
bad,"-advancement only for favored employees"
bad,"My time at party city was mainly negative as I was treated unfairly, and would lose hours for an undisclosed reason. The manager situation was also negative, my manager did nothing to help me and if she did it was a burden to her."
bad,Managers were rude and lazy and awful. They don‚Äôt care about you or your hours or customers but once the direct manager or Corp comes in the store that‚Äôs when they ‚Äúwork hard‚Äù! Don‚Äôt waste your time there ! Don‚Äôt dont even pay much or give you hours as they said they would give you ! Place is always dirty and managers don‚Äôt care to clean it up
bad,"Worked as a supervisor. The management above me was awful. Poor training and would yell at you if you didn‚Äôt know something. Made issues personal. Did not make enough money to make up for the drive to and from the location. Nor for what you had to deal with between customers, employees and upper management. Helium shortage didn‚Äôt help these situations either. It‚Äôs also almost always just one manager and one associate during the busy times....."
bad,No work/life balance . Totally against labour board laws and management does not care . Worst experience of my life as a supervisor. The company expectations and the labour hours given are completely unreasonable
bad,Something about the store brings the worst out of customers. People were always stealing and making messes. They also have a public bathroom...in a town filled with homeless people. Cleaning that bathroom was the bane of my existence and of course none of the managers would do it. Somehow employees never leave but also don't get promoted because of that too. If you start off as an associate have fun counting the minutes till your shift is over because all they have the newbies doing is cashiering because its the worst job to do. Customers love yelling and complaining about anything to the cashiers.
bad,"My management were all close friends so if one manager hated you, they all did. One shift lead didnt know what he was doing half the time and had a perpetual bad attitude."
bad,unsatisfactory with little direction from head office. the company is years behind everyone else. less for more is an understatement when the gm is working 7 days a week because there is no budget
bad,"Fun place to work during the holidays with the customers not with the staff.  I used to love working there it started off an amazing job, promised so many things from management I was excited for my future. I would say eight months to a year it started going down hill, new people started and I guess when they Have new people it‚Äôs like having a new shiny penny.  I have never worked for a place that you had to be in with the good crowd or the popular click just to have a good day at work if that circle of people did not like you ,you might as well forget it, they‚Äôre always going to talk about you, they‚Äôre always going to be mean to you, they‚Äôre always going to look down to you and degrade you, if they really don‚Äôt like you they will cut your hours and just tell you the hours just aren‚Äôt available which is a lie. They are very mean and manipulative people,  I am not just a bitter employee or anything like that I still have friendships from there and I have learned a lot about retail unfortunately, I just had a really bad experience from being treated poorly and just downright mean from management and certain associates that work there. I hope the next person that takes management there finally does something and steps up and Kicks the people that are doing all the stuff to the curb and they get all new staff no one should ever have to be treated like that. The things they do behind the district manager and corporate‚Äôs back is unbelievable one of these days they‚Äôll get caught I feel sorry for the people that work there though hopefully gets better."
bad,It's a mans world. Not enough staffing for breaks or lunches. Use up employees. Favoritism and most of all work goes unrecognized. No proper training even when asked.
bad,not sure why this is having me write a review about a job I had in college.  Wasn't a horrible place to work had a lot of fun and made a lot of great friends.
bad,The management is very asinine. The only time it‚Äôs hours available is Halloween üòÜ everyone is slow and acts like everything is always sold out. Don‚Äôt work here
bad,Management team was trash . Didnt train me correctly. Communication was worse so i had to always deal with angry customers . Co-workers was lazy as heck didnt wanna do anything AT ALL . Store was a complete wreck .. alot of leaks . District manager was Rude . I could go on forever lol. But just kno they trash
bad,"Constant stress and minimal hours to give out. Head office refuses to implement anything to help prevent shrink. HR from what I noticed isnt confidential. If you‚Äôre looking for a job that will make you miserable, this is the place."
bad,the managers are rude and inappropriate. would never recommend. the customers are INSANE. hardly get breaks. t‚Äôs stressful and i work way to hard for minimum wage. i‚Äôm left at the balloon counter with my hands bleeding bc i‚Äôve blown up probably a thousand balloons in that 9 hour awful sunday shift. halloween is also the most stressful and anxiety filled experiences. never. work. here.
bad,"Company bleeds you dry with a minimum number of workers required to be employed at the store and then giving said workers almost 0 hours to actually work, meaning a bunch of people are barely getting any work instead of a smaller group actually making enough hours aka money to pay for anything. Hands out projects, responsibilities, and additional work like candy with no hesitation or regard for regular store duties that need to be completed. Maximum work for minimum pay and they appear to care little, I do not recommend."
bad,Party city is great for a high school student other than that i wouldn't want to make it a career. with that being said i would never work at any retail place again.
bad,"would not recommend to anyone , not the friendliest working environment. my two years was not enjoyed. ................................................."
bad,"Working at party city I realized how poor the management was, how low the salary was, how awful the staff treats each other. There is no communication in the work place. Overall I would never recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"i worked at party city for a few months when i first started i noticed a weird vibe coming from my manager & when i first applied it said id be getting paid 9.50/ hr once i got my first pay check after i worked for well more than i was suuposed to i was not impressed at all on how my check looked. i relaized they needed help bad so i reached out to some of my friends to apply and one of them got job, after a few weeks i suddenly stopped getting hours i was probably getting 1 day out of the week 5 hr shifts but i held in jus to get the little coins i can get then my manager calls me into his office and says he has to let me go i'm  just says okay i shook his hand and walked out his reasoning was because "" he hired to many people"" but i kept in contact with my friend that worked there he hired someone right after i left that day still don't know The real reason i was fired. i was the only person that actually wanted to work morning shifts."
bad,"every retail store depends on their customers but Party City will step on their employees to keep a customer who is rude, entitled and hostile.  An employee could follow company guidelines to the letter and upper management will throw that employee under the bus to make a $5 sale."
bad,"Overall, in my year and a half of working at Party City, I was always told I was gonna be promoted to a Front End Supervisor, and it never happened. Not only that, but the managers don‚Äôt really care for the employees needs, horrible hours and horrible management. I want to work at a place where I get to learn new things that I‚Äôve never had, I would like to expand my knowledge of workplaces, and at party city I can not do that."
bad,Not a good staff or Management. No organization and they were very rude. I felt uncomfortable working there and I would never recommend anyone to worth there.
bad,"This was one of the worst places to work, especially this location. I was lied to over the phone by management saying I had a shift when I confirmed IN PERSON my schedule. I told them I couldn't work that day and was yelled at for it. Another day, I was guilted again for being unable to work extra hours, or work on my day off. Management shouldn't guilt their employees or yell at them for THEIR scheduling ineptitude. "
bad,"It was such a terrible job, there's was like 10 managers and they were awful. Treated employees terribly. When you asked for help the managers would either complain or yell at you for not doing what you're supposed to do even on your first day. please do not work here. worst job ever"
bad,"coworkers were very rude! everyone was very lazy! nobody wanted to work, rude manager, theft from coworkers. very slow. not helpful. disrespectful as well."
bad,This place was just terrible I was over worked as a student and the sales associates and managers were always quitting so I was often doing manager jobs for no money! They paid 725 and you only get 10¬¢ a year raise! I was only making 7:45 after 2 years
bad,they claim to be a family oriented establishment but in truth they are not. when my 2 month old son stopped breathing i was told i couldn't leave without being fired.
bad,"This job would be better fit for high school student, as this job only pays minimum wage. Party City isn't a place to obtain a career, there isn't any room for advancement to any positions that could be more career oriented."
bad,It's a high schoolers job. It's not the place to be if you're looking for a real job. There are no benefits if you're working part-time. Full time is only if you're in a management position. Management doesn't care about you. District management doesn't care either. You're basically treated like dirt.
bad,"It seens like there is nothing but drama between managers, no communication, lack of hours for any employee unless your a gm. An lets not get started on the pay a co worker of mine is a FES whos been there longer then the store manager an that employee only makes 8 something an hour an ive been there just over 2 years an stock room manager an i dont make hardly anything. I dont plan on being employed there very long."
bad,Working at Party City was a very poor environment to be part of.  I did learn a lot from the experience because I was forced to problem solve everything on my own due to no support.  The culture was very non existent due to not having much contact with the rest of the district.  This did allow me to make my own positive culture within my store.  The hardest part of the job was the lack of support from the company.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that I was allowed to run the store in a way I thought was best.
bad,No training just thrown in! General manger dont know how to run a store properly! Lack of communication on all management staff! Party city expects the general manager to do nothing and the other management team to do it all!
bad,Terrible place to work at. They hire a bunch of kids who don‚Äôt even do their job correctly and they take advantage of you doesn‚Äôt offer competitive $$
bad,working there was hard. management wasn't the best. they also said I was not seasonal but then let me go because they said I was. Great customers though.
bad,"low pay, managers are extremely power hungry and use their title as they see it benefit them, rude customers, co-workers who just pawn jobs off to others as they do nothing and not a great system for who gets breaks when."
bad,"This place will judge you to the max and not care, they are super rude and half of them are stupid and slack off or just be super slow. id never work here again"
bad,"Terrible place to work at, it is a seasonal job not really worth the time and the pay is low and the work is stressful. I understand that it wasn't supposed to be a full or part-time job, But it seems like they expect you to give 110% for meager pay"
bad,Party City it's all about the money for them they don't care about the little people and the management treat you like you are nothing they don't care about you and they talk down to you the front of the  customers
bad,"Your like a robot they give you the ""Planner"" that has everything in it you have to complete for the month. You can't use your own ideas for anything. If you change something even if it gets the porfits or GM up they don't care if it's not in the planner."
bad,I did not like working at Party City.   I liked the staff but no opportunity for moving up in company. Did'nt't understand policys and procedures.  They changed everyday it seemed
bad,"It was a seasonal temporary job but gave me experience on the register, customers service, stocking experience, team work, safety, and knowledge about Halloween."
bad,"Work place was friendly,sometimes it would be slow depending on the holidays. I worked her for just seasonal for Halloween it was crazy calling for orders and giving customers there costumes."
bad,I used to work for the Party city in Marietta GA and everything was perfect out there. I recently moved to Racine WI and I haven't been working for Party City for more than a Month and they slack on my hours and their already putting blames on me for things I've never done. They don't care for their customers. Management sits around and just gossips about their daily life instead of getting the store prepped and ready for the Halloween Holiday to come. I'll have customer's here and their complain about our Management and complement me on how much nicer I am and I only work the register. Management treats me as if I have no idea what I'm doing even though I already have experience with the company and I already know how everything works. It's very unfair on how they treat their associates.
bad,"No room to grow, no support from corporate, had to cancel vacations often and lose time off. No option to relocate no calls back on internal cater site when you apply. Halloween sometimes fun but stressful"
bad,"They don't appreciate hard work in any way shape or form. They overwork you more than what would be suggested. Any little mistake you made, instead of correcting you so it doesn't happen again, you get yelled at and scolded as if you were a child. NEVER work for this company."
bad,"Company used to have a teamwork system in "
bad,"I wish I could‚Äôve worked for them longer but I had a great experience working there. Met cool"
bad,"For a starting job, this is the place to start. Maybe get about a years worth of experience and then get out. There is no room for advancement, corporate keeps cutting back our hours so us part time associates get horrible hours. We hardly see our hours reach 20 for the week. It‚Äôs impossible to make a living working for this company unless you are in management. Also, our management sucks. We have had many customer complaints about our head management as well as us associates making complaints but nothing is done. The work environment is very hostile and it‚Äôs not even a place any of us can enjoy. Lead manager talks bad about the employees to other employees. It‚Äôs just a huge hot mess at this store. Corporate wants us to contact them if we have any issues or concerns but never hear back from them. Party City doesn‚Äôt care about their customers or their employees."
bad,Very underpaid. Got minimum wage for taking down the whole store with 4 other people in one day. They over work you a lot. Would not recommend. Played favorites with management and associates.
bad,Wouldn't recommend to the worst of my enemy. The pay is extremely low and the customers very rude. the Halloween season is atrocious. Never work for them.
bad,a one month job that paid $9 an hour and they gave me very little hours it was a Halloween seasonal job only. I would work only 3 days for 4hours in a week.
bad,"I would not suggest anybody looking for a part time job to work at Party City, In Oshawa - Whitby Ontario. "
bad,"Management was distant and hard to relate to. They didn't help with unruly or angry customers, instead let employees flounder for as long a possible. Many employees saw it as a temporary position because that's how we were treated. Employee turn-around was very short and discouraging."
bad,"This is a job for high schoolers and should be treated as such. No adult should choose to work here, ever. It is also very poorly organized with no hope for reinvention."
bad,The employees were delightful but the manager and assistant manager were not respectful or professional. The manager was neglegant and the assistant manager yelled at employees
bad,There is no consistent work schedule unless you were to stay past their seasonal positions. At times they would ask you to stay overtime  and you would only receive one 10 minute break.
bad,"If it wasn't for the season associates who kept this business fun there i no point working for this company. They under pay you, fudge hours worked and never return calls."
bad,"No work life balance, No raises, no benefits, no advancement."
bad,It was a fun place to work and the best part about it was the costumers and the kids seeing them happy was awesome also blowing balloons was pretty fun
bad,"Workplace culture was negative"
bad,It was the halloween season so it was extremelt stressful. Everyone was super busy. They basically just let you float around and ask people for help. I wouldn't do it again.
bad,"horrible management, cheap products, rude customers, bad pay, everyone disrespects you if you work under them even though both jobs are bad and the manager makes $1.50 more than the normal employees"
bad,"Manager there is super rude. Requested days off right away, schedule came out and they scheduled me on my days off. The manager was rude and threw a fit saying how hard it is to make a schedule. Like really? Coworkers were great though. Customers are kind."
bad,"The management here is horrible! They all act like immature 12 year old girls gossiping and talking about co workers, even the store manager. They expect you to be on the floor and stocking things while also being the only person up from on the cashier so you have to keep an eye on the front if you are stocking. They do not pay enough for the amount of work put in. You will get your job threatened if you don‚Äôt ask for emails from customers. They only give people 12 hours a week (for part time) because everyone shares hours and they limit the amount of hours you can have per week. If you are still in Highschool and/or living with your parents this is the perfect job for you! Beware you will be treated badly."
bad,"Terrible management, office was dirty, managers dated employees, never received breaks, main managers were rude to employees, always got in trouble for not doing other employees jobs not a great place to work!!!"
bad,"This was my first job, and the lowest paying. The management team was unmotivated and didn't seem like they wanted to be there. The energy they spread to the rest of the team made us all feel like we didn't want to be there."
bad,"There is not room for advancement with Party City. The management is unreasonable with the expectations of their employees. The turn over rate it very high as people keep quitting and for very good reason. The pay is low and the environment is very poor. There are some good people there but they keep quitting so you wont see them very long. The company is not efficient at all, they are wasting money with outdated ideas and philosophies. If they listen to their staff the ideas can not only save them money but also make them money."
bad,I somewhat liked working at Halloween city but then again otherwise if I had a decision I would‚Äôve chosen to work elsewhere . Coworkers have no respect for each other very rude and careless
bad,The store is completely unprofessional. You have employees cursing at each other in front of customers. Having personal conversations in front of customers. You have employees with horrible attitudes and the managers have attitudes just as bad as the employees. Corporate offices need to do with their selection of their employees.
bad,"this was by far the worst job ive had the work place was boring the managers played favorites and treated newbies like trash  and so did the workers, the managers was rude to customers and gave the store a bad reputation."
bad,Party city is a very small store and only have about 10 people working there if you become a seasonal you will not get hire on due to the lack of bussiness
bad,i would never recommend anyone to work here because unless you are management you are not treated fairly. i hated how they would make me treat my staff sometimes. also very bad hours but not enough staff.
bad,"You would think that it would be fun but it isn't, and the higher ups take no responsibility when it comes to harassment against employees, instead they just try to cover it up."
bad,"Decent place to work if you are a high school or college student. It gets crazy around the holidays. Management is severely lacking, somewhere between lazy or incompetent"
bad,"i worked here for about a year and a half, management only got worse and worse with time, they take advantage of how hard you work. my advice: dont go into this business expecting to move up or get paid what you may deserve, this job is a job for someone who doesnt mind getting paid very little for a lot of work."
bad,"Do not expect to move up if the manager is always asking you to do his job, mine was always on his phone and did NOT want to help any customers even if he was insight, his exact words were do not call me if there are other people in the building"
bad,did not enjoy working there one bit. management was lazy and disorganized. everyone was always mad and never happy. the only reason I stayed was because they needed help
bad,"Party City constantly hires new employees who have no desire in customer service and no desire to make others happy. With the negative attitudes towards management or any sort of authority, as well as towards customers creates a negative environment for the entire store. The lack of communication from employee to employee makes it difficult to exchange any new information or new tasks given to employees. They also need to update the 1995 type of computers for a higher year of the register programs in which we input balloon orders. These systems constantly shut down and it becomes inconvenient for customers."
bad,"Management wasn't the greatest"
bad,As management there was no consideration for my home life. Changed my schedule to opening-closing without any prior warning and walking in to see said adjustments.
bad,I did not enjoy working here. They play the favorite game and if you are not one of them then you get treated pretty unfair. They do not like if you call in and will almost shame you for it
bad,It has been years since I have worked here but when I did the managers were rude not helpful very little training. Felt like high school and the managers would gossip about the employees
bad,"poor work enviorment , manager were not stable. not friendly .  Not a set schedule, not proper managment. Unprofessional workers and managers. Unsanitary"
bad,"i am an epileptic. my management thought it would be okay to make fun of me for having epilepsy, the only reason i stayed there was because i didnt owe bills at the time and the money i was making was helping with gas and nobody was hiring. i would never recommend this place to work as long as the management thats still there is still there."
bad,"Before becoming Party City, Iparty was a joy to work at. However, after Party City came in everything went down hill. The corporate only seemed to care about numbers and sales as opposed to caring for customers and its employees."
bad,"dont recommend party city, days were boring, not enough hours given, not getting paid enough. Managers did not listen to employees. Party city doesn't care about employees"
bad,"working here is really boring and tedious. the managers are all miserable. coworkers are okay, but managers really ruin it. no room for improvement or promotion at this job"
bad,Manager was very immature. Co workers were nice. Hours were nice. No overtime allowed. It was fun at times but not very empowering for me to feel like it was worth time.
bad,"Party City is a store full of flaws, from the management/employees, and the place itself. The plaza it resides in is kind of shady and surrounded by stores nobody's heard of. The only time anybody goes to Party City is for holidays and the occasional party. The staff is untrained and are unfit for the positions they have.  Managers are nowhere to be seen and don't contribute to the staff as a whole. Apart from being lost trying to figure out who's working and what to do, they expect you to be extra productive without direction until someone finds you and shames you for doing a section of your job because no one ever said what to do. There's no organization, it's scattered, and half of the staff is in the break room sitting down leaving the work for 2 or 3 people."
bad,A typical a day at work is coming in for your shift on time and ready to jump into your work. Workplace culture is important. You must have a great environment and positive to work around.
bad,Everyone I worked with feared the store manager.  He would write you up for being one minute late or if he felt you took to long to take out the trash
bad,"They don't give enough of hours to the associates and management is terrible due to them not paying enough and they don't take the time to care of others, with all due respect."
bad,Managers were very rude and inconsiderate. The hours changed all over the place; No stability in the company. I don't recommend it for the pay they are trying to give you for all of the work you do as an employee.
bad,While I work there I got paid 7.25 and worked 30 hours a week. It was very stressful and they would sometimes ask me to leave school just so I could come into work even though I was still in high school. I worked so many hours and super late into the night so I  did not continue the job due to low pay and needed to focus on school much more than work at that time.
bad,Usually I felt like the managers of where I worked really didn't help you out much. Once you work there you're on your own. A typical day would be just going to your aisle and stay there until the end of your shift without the manager to be there to help you out especially when you're just starting out for the first time. They usually make your stay 2 hours overtime without it being paid.
bad,"Managers are not happy, employees are not happy. It's just not good.  Nobody wanted to be there, and the only good thing about it was at least it was a job. But it took forever to get anywhere within the company."
bad,difficult bosses. Difficult work load. You can only work for the pay as the environment is super difficult. no wonder everyone leaves every year after halloween hours are done.
bad,I helped customers by cashing them out and fulfilling balloon orders. I also answered questions from customers via the telephone. Most enjoyable part was working with people to plan parties.
bad,"Horrible, no benefits if your parttime, horrible benefits if your even full time. no chance for career advancement. Sometimes your left with two people on a busy sunday afternoon to work the tills. Horrible cashier technology to work with. depending on where you work the workers are always straped for hours. Unless you have another retail job on the side you will not make ends meet. Especially with fluctuating hours that are not at all reliable. I overall had horrible work experiences working there. The most enjoyabe part was blowing up balloons."
bad,bad very busy and rude customers. the shifts were very short. ar one point we never had soap in the bathrooms and our manager refused to restock it because a customer had kept on stealing the bottle.
bad,"Pay was horrible, management was horrible, the hours were also horrible. I disliked everything about working for this establishment. "
bad,managers were horrible they were hires from Mervins when they shut down they hired all there staff from mervyns and were working them 40+ over time and giving the employees that were employed before they got hired 16 hrs a week working 4 hours a day
bad,The supervisor & manager are unprofessional. They use profanity & make fun of employees. This was one of the most tense environments Ive ever worked in.
bad,"I really enjoyed working at this place and location, But to be honest, management is really tough at or with all its employees, You have to be favored or liked to have a permanent position."
bad,This job is for high school students. The start rate is minimum wage. I enjoyed working here because they worked around my schedule. I enjoyed my co workers. There is always a overload of work but not enough people to do it. I worked her for a year. Halloween can be super fun but it can be overwhelming.
bad,Crazy during Halloween with kids playing with swords and customers changing into costumes in dressing rooms. Tall ladders with nothing to hold onto while putting away merchandise. Break room was the corner of the warehouse with two chairs and TV tray.
bad,"I believe Party city problems stem from management. And many lazy employees, instead of doing their job like they should, they try to boss some other employee into doing it for them. While they walk around the store, and BS with the manager all day."
bad,"horrible boss , doesn't treat you with respect, tried to pay me below minimum wage, lonely , bored , doesn't feel safe , very strict manager , not a good place to work at"
bad,at party city the constantly worked us while others did little to nothing to help move the work load quicker than normal. the managers constantly made racial joke and made us do their job so that they could leave before their shift was up. the gave us little to no hours and treated other associates like they were in the corporate office. party city is an unfair job and I wouldn't tell a soul to work there.
bad,Overall working at Party City has taught me a lot about retail and different ways of trying to achieve goals. Processes could be run smoother.
bad,"a typical day at work was going checking in maintaining your station and clocking out Management and coworkers mostly team players, hardest part of the job was the individual candy and toy isle and the most enjoyable was the balloon counter."
bad,Working at Party City was such a good experience because I learned how to quickly work under pressure. That is one quality I will use in every job in the future. My co-workers were nice and very helpful the managers were helpful as well.
bad,Most enjoyable part of the job was stock. I had to build the store in October 2015 for $8.75. Co-workers barely did work either.
bad,"Enjoyed working with staff and customers. Very hands on management job. Teamwork is essential. General Managers are expected to do everything from throwing freight, scheduling, HR issues, ringing, POG, deposits, and too much more to list. Stores operate on little hours and are expected to accomplish way too much. Very high pressured job, very little support for general managers,"
bad,"a typical day for party city at first was ok for me. I would come to work late at night and work till the morning. I learned how to stock, I also did a little construction. I got along with all my co-workers. the hardest part for me was the pay."
bad,"The job is extremely stressful, with little pay. Constantly overworked and hardly ever get a raise. There's also a lot of drama within the staff which adds more unnecessary stress."
bad,Its an ok place for a high school student that is just looking for extra cash but its not a good place to work if you have resppnsiblities to take care of.
bad,"The environment is high paced. Their mantra is this is where you get more party for less. If you enjoy giving and planning parties, this is the store for you."
bad,"Not a Party, Long hours, Just not a place to work . Was the worst retail job I had in 30 years. Company treats you like a number they do not appreciate your dedication."
bad,"The worst place I have ever worked at. Everyone was rude, and would never be of any help at all. Management didn't care about the seasonal employees at all, and would baby the regular employees."
bad,"Halloween city varied in the amount of customers that came in, we changed a lot of displays, kept the store looking clean, helped out parents and adults pick out the right costume for them. The management was terrible, my co-workers were no exception. The hardest part about the job was keeping the job, the most enjoyable part was the holiday itself."
bad,"The managers were horrible! They treated customers and employees horribly!! "
bad,"This was my first job working in retail. From my experience it wasn't the best. It's really not even the customer( even though they are not always pleasant ,but that is a given ); its the management! I've never been talked down to so bad. They were lazy and as an employee i didn't feel appreciated."
bad,low pay for managers and employees very boring the training program not good to advance it takes a long timemmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
bad,Terrible people with no respect. Management jokes around too much with no respect. I felt like i was treated unfair. Management was a joke. hardest part of the job was interacting with management.
bad,There is no room for advancement what so ever unless you are a friend or family member of higher up management. The pay is horrible for all of the stress and dangerous working environments.
bad,Never work here!!! Please save yourself! It was the worse job I've ever had in my life!!!! Management and staff were verry immature never trained! I can't express how bad this job was!
bad,A typical day at Party City for me was I would help customer's with costumes and accessories and I had to help them with the fitting rooms and help clean the store and organize it. I learned at this seasonal job you must be quick on your feet. The management was poorly organized and I always had to cover for someone else. The co-workers were unfriendly and they always talked behind your back. The hardest part was covering the fitting room and helping with costumes and the most enjoyable part was closing time.
bad,never been treated so horribly in my life. management + head office had disgusting selling tactics and had no respect for employees.
bad,"PartyCity...this place was by far one of the worst places I have ever worked for the people were rude and and boss treted almost every one who did not fit his standers like dirt, I would never recommend this place to my family and frends"
bad,After more than a decade of service it is obvious that they do not value loyalty or hard work. the franchise system is poorly run and there is no consistency from store to store.
bad,After more than a decade of service with this company I have learned that they do not value loyalty or hard work.  The franchise system is poorly run and there is no consistency from store to store.
bad,Overall good place to work. Nice place to start off a first job at.
bad,"Point less, experience workers are put in useless parts of the store, the less experienced are deployed on crucial areas. Management sees charity sales as a way to look good with the company not to benefit the charities."
bad,"Its a mallow paste and productive work place to be active."
bad,I was a cashier and I love my job helping people.and seeing a smile on their face everyday.it really makes me happy.
bad,Party city did not like to work with you when things went wrong at home or with my family. They treated all employees really bad.I did learn alot working at party city I learned cutomer sevice and communication skills along with management.
bad,boss would hit on every girl that walked in. He never did anything but bug everyone and then yell at you for not doing your job. They cut you down to an hour a week because they over hire people. They criticize everything you do even if its what they tell you to do.
bad,it was a job. i only worked for the Halloween season. we where laided off Halloween night.
bad,to many people not doing their job and everything was just unorganized.
bad,"-The pay is bad"
bad,"Rate of pay was meager, the management was disrespectful and discriminatory."
bad,"The district was run by one family, and there was a lot of nepatism within the stores which prevented fairness to others."
bad,It was hectic all the time. Employees were stealing money from the store as well as the managers .
bad,"Love the customers"
bad,Long hours.
bad,Each day store was empty. Nothing ever to do and hours were very bad.
bad,Owners want to keep control of the company and have no clue of what happen at the stores. Fired good people and let the people who stole and mistreat people do what ever they want.
bad,"When I worked at this job I never had time for my daughter at all the hours i worked were before she woke up or after she went to school I never had any weekends free and then when we got a new store managers he cut all the employees hours from 15-25hrs a week to 4-12hrs and I continued to work there because I had to take care of my child but then I got fired because my child got sick and I had to call in but no one was there to take my call so he considered it a no call no show but before he fired me all the way he made me work my last day and then didn't fire me until 2 weeks later. the only thing I liked about my job were the other associates, the old managers and the customers."
bad,Cashier's do all the work. Management is not very active. Not loyal to employees at all.
bad,"I have been in management for ten years, this was by far the worst job I have ever had. Management is rude and curses at you.... Upper Management does not care one bit about the employees as long as numbers at meet. I would rather clean bathrooms than work at the Hagerstown or Frederick, MD locations... All owned by the same corporation.. Very bad experience..."
bad,"Most enjoyable part of the day was blowing up ballons. A typical day was pretty easy going. Majority of the customers helped themselves with what ever items they needed, Only asked for assistance when they were either in a rush or simply didn't know where the items were located in the store."
bad,"I worked there for a year and saw favoritism, black listing, lying, empty promises, no appreciation for one's efforts."
bad,I worked really hard at my job and felt like I didn‚Äôt get paid enough for my hard work. Didn‚Äôt tell me if I had the job. Had me waiting to see for weeks if I still had a job. In the end I never got told they just have my no shifts
bad,"Upper management including HR, district manager and above are clueless. No support, organization including a non existing IT department. Horrible place to work. Stand clear"
bad,I wouldn‚Äôt recomend this job to people I was hired as a sales associate and the I became a normal associate my manager was fired for a not fare reason and I was being treated bad by these people I appreciate for the job opportunity but I wouldn‚Äôt recomend this job to people.
bad,"Horrible management, staff are treated terribly and the business is not well run. They know nothing about time management. The owner may be successful but knows nothing about running a business or about workers rights."
bad,Corporate management is not in touch with the actual work load in the store.  General manager routinely works 6 to 7 day weeks because payroll hours are unrealistically low.
bad,"They treat their managers like total trash. There is poor communication and bad decisions. They want to be a customer centric company but they are so task driven. They want you to do all these tasks in an unachievable time frame, but want you to take care of customers. They give you no hours to do the work and then ask you why you were not able to complete tasks. This was a mistake working for them and I have learned my lesson. They have no open door policy and HR, what HR? You try to get help and they brush you off or make you feel like you are bothering them. Stay away from Party city if you can."
bad,"The Daly City/Serramonte Center manager is terrible and does not value the team members. He solely cares about making numbers and overachieving for sales instead of caring for his employees. Also speaks to employees very disrespectfully, he cussed out employees. Nobody ever stays for more than a couple years. Also pay inequality during the Halloween season is a huge problem."
bad,"I work there at Tukwila, Wa Location for two days my second day I felt like push over all did is Recovery no cash register or ballons. The lots employee treat me nice but some Mangement make feel like couldn't talk. Plus way they pay you & way tell you thing & lied between there teeth."
bad,"I was an Assistant Manager with over 20+ years as a General Manager in a variety of small box retail stores.  "
bad,"i worked as a general manager in Charlotte for this company for 7 years. As this has been a good while ago, I worked for this little short troll with a power trip, that was over all operations. You might as well forget being able to enjoy any holidays, as they make sure to overwork you as much as they can get away with. From what I am hearing now from previous co-workers / good friends, is that all the district managers are totally against the actual general managers. They are looking for any and everything they can find to use against you. The current person over operations is someone that has nothing else better to do with her time except talk behind the backs of others. She will be nice to your face, but that quickly changes if you're not on her good side, I never got along with her. She loves to talk about her female partner right much, which is inappropriate.  All in all, the company is fun at times, but the fun and excitement gets old very quickly!"
bad,All you did was either cashier or do in aisle resets for the holiday that was coming up. It is a very laborious job or boring job depending on your position. Management is sometimes lazy and handling theft is wondering if your boss was going to get killed. Their programs like the green dot program to tell if products are on order of not is wasteful and they trash so much stuff. Wasteful com
bad,"Employees were unhappy, so was management. Had new people from a different store come and they tried to run the store(particularly a cashier). They don‚Äôt know what customer service is. They are SO rude. Management and others would stand right in front and would refuse to help customers, greet people or answer phones but expect you to."
bad,"I worked just for a week on a contract position, and had to leave for 3 weeks on an unpaid vacation to get my visa renewed. I was told it was ok at the time of the interview. When I returned from my trip, I received a mail saying, ""Party City no longer needs your services,"" without any reason. "
bad,"lool this job is  a joke, you can do better. if this your first job it fine for the Halloween season then get the out of there. managment is made up of people that dont really care  and the CEO is trash."
bad,I worked here for almost a year and it was the worst experience of my life. Needless to say I needed a job. I recently got fired because I confronted a manager about sharing personal information with a costumer. He got angry at me and ( I‚Äôm a female 17 years old ) yelled at me and followed me to the door and closed it shut only to say ‚Äúgood luck!‚Äù Also the managers in general are rude.
bad,"This job is the worst I‚Äôve ever had. The management is poor, the associates leave garbage on the counters, the schedules are very inconsitant, nothing is well put together, the training is bad, the customers are the worst, and you just get thrown into things. There were a few nice moments working there for as long as I didn‚Äôt but not enough to recommend working there to someone. Not even to mention how long it takes to memorize everything there. Don‚Äôt get this job if you‚Äôre planning on working there for less than a year, it‚Äôs too stressful for that."
bad,They dont promote from within. The company is completely top heavy with little room for growth for the average worker. They would rather recruit people from the outside for higher positions than promote those who are already doing the job.
bad,Hours dropped constantly. The management sucked i literally did others people work and could barely finish mines then get Penalized for not finishing my work but i had to do others people work...just a mess with management..
bad,I didnt like it tthere cause it was boring and I ddint like the manger or peolpe that worked therer and it need more hours and more pay and it was not a good place
bad,I had a bed experience with party city.  Very stressful and unfair work environment. Management played a lot of favorites with employees and not everyone was treated fairly.
bad,"Horrible work/home balance."
bad,"This company is taking a turn of the worse. There is no room to grow, they don't pay enough for the job they want done. Most people in corporate are coming from Toys R Us and you can feel the change within the company, you know it's bad when other managers tell you get out as fast as you can."
bad,"I would not recommend this company to anyone other than maybe high school students.  The pay is non competitive, and the workload is unmanageable.  There are absolutely no efficiencies in the job, yet the labor demands are unattainable."
bad,If you are interested in Party City do your homework regarding the ownership of the store.  Is it a franchise location or corporate?  I made the mistake of working with a franchise owner and I felt constantly wedged between corporate direction and what the owner wanted.  It was a no win situation.
bad,the general manger very poor job
bad,"Very busy. Different costumes and accessories. Party items, baby showers, weddings,bridal showers,welcoming babies. Big quality on candy varieties.  Different attitudes. Stores gets busy on Halloween also very messy. I‚Äôm"
bad,Low level employees were forgotten about in their recent company transition. It is impossible to get any issues reviewed and reconciled due to lack of communication through the chain of command. They edit pay without consent.
bad,This company is in serious financial trouble. They laid off about 600 managers and their is no end in sight. Payroll was cut 100 hours and all of the extra responsibility goes on the store manager
bad,"I learned that hard work and ethics are not substitute for agreeing with and complimenting upper managements opinion of the day or moods."
bad,not a great place to work filled with trashy unfriendly crew members. the crew members are unhelpful. most enjoyable part of my job was helping ids pick out Halloween costumes
bad,There was never more than 2 employees working at once in such a big store and we constantly moved the store around so it was always a mess and nothing could ever be found
bad,You will receive the bare minimum amount of hours for minimum wage. Corporate does not care about their employees and offers minimum benefits.
bad,A typical day at work was usually stale. most employees would not greet back when greeted. Management would only point out at negative things and not have a balance of positive/negative things to say. I learned to be more patient. Management was horrible. Unorganized and with little knowledge on manners. A lot of preferences and prejudices over in the managerial and coworker environment. The hardest part of the job was having patience with all of my coworkers who didn't even seem to care about their jobs. The most enjoyable honestly was getting to help customers with what they needed.
bad,"too many managers....good job for first timers...health and safety is a joke..."
bad,Sesonal work worked for Halloween busy that time of the year helped alot of people look for costumes stayed busy.Nice fun place.
bad,"management was horrible they didn't care enough for employees breaks, i did learn how to handle stressful situations. co workers were decent managers did have egos and it seems like your bothering them and your asking them questions. Hardest part was handling large amounts of customers who weren't nice because the Elsa costume was sold out."
bad,"There is always something gone wrong at party city. There is no order to anything and that gets chaotic very quickly, especially during Halloween."
bad,"There was no communication between management and employees. When hired you were not told that you were temporary, In other words you weren't told anything."
bad,They talk very good about training and wanting to see staff grow.   But they have gone through and fired everyone that has been there over a year.  I was also told several times that it doesn't matter what the customer wanted.  No appreciation for anyone.
bad,Party City is not a very employee oriented work place. Management is very selfish and they do not care about the employees. They tend to be borderline abusive.
bad,"I applied to what was called Party Packagers at the time, and was hired to work full-time a month after the store was open. I worked 8-4 Monday to Fridays. When I got my first pay, I was disappointed because I was making less working full-time. The manager was shady and hard to trust. The staff were hard to work with and seemed out of touch with reality. My supervisor often accused me of insubordination and wrote me up for something I didn`t do. Me and another guy working there were let go after working 2 months there. I cleaned out my locker and left, and the manager said ""Don`t go slashing my tires"". I used him as a reference, and he ended up screwing me out of a job opportunity."
bad,"typical day at work includes ringing on the register and then maintaining the store"
bad,Its a typical retail job. The customer is always right even when they are not. You could be with the company forever and still not receive a raise. Good luck if you work for them.
bad,"My managers were always great, but corporate was completely unprofessional. "
bad,I worked here when I was in highschool and I will say it's a good part time job to start off with .
bad,"Assisted with the over all function of the store, customer service, work freight that came in, Helped fill balloon orders, returns, bank deposits, The best part of this job was the employees, they were a great group of people. The hardest handling the moral issue of money that this franchise allowed to happen."
bad,I worked many many hours for this company off the clock to try to help them. Then come the end of season they did not call me to continue to help them tear down.
bad,the manager has an attitude with everyone all the time for no reason at all.  their interview process is just sitting in a back room while the manager looks at you with a stank face and gives everyone attitude. the employees are lazy and very drama orientated.
bad,"This company simply just does not care about its employees. I was brought in to fix a broken store as an assistant manager and never have I experienced such combativeness and a GM completely unwilling to have my back. Favoritism, constant job threats, horrible hours, and blatant lying. They pay their part time employees next to nothing, and I was only able to obtain the salary I was given because of my extensive management experience. Shameful company."
bad,the job was self explanatory an following the rules an shouldn't have problem but the most enjoyable thing about it is people trying on the different costumes
bad,A typical day would consist of walking in and already being told what to do in an aggressive manner before even clocking in. The managers are often lazy and give the associates their work plus work that the associate already had. Often times there would be ten hour shifts without a break. Managers never help the cashier when it is busy. People point fingers to save themselves and often lie and people get in trouble without any actual proof. Everyone there doesn't take their job seriously because there is no example set.
bad,"The PartyCity in mays landing, New Jersey has to be the worst place I could ever imagine working. On my first day, I was made to watch training videos and read some information on company policies. I was then sent up to the front to shadow another employee on the registers. I spent the entire day p there, by myself with no way of contacting other employees for help. I had to handle all customer needs with no knowledge of how best to assist them. I had to stay an hour longer than my 5-hour shift, I was given no breaks, and I was not actually trained at all. The day after this, I received my schedule and the manager gave me hours that I specifically told them I could not work because I have class. They had no regard for me at all. This is a terrible workplace with very very poor management. I would avoid this place at all costs!!!"
bad,Never gets rid of any merchandise. It just sits in the backroom or even worse an offsite storage. Company dumps huge projects on you in the middle of your busiest season.  Was working everyday to try to catch up a broken store. Help was promised but never delivered on. Would not recommend to anyone as a store manager.
bad,"I received ZERO training before I was expected to get on a register and start working. I was left alone at the front of the store on my second day, with no balloon training and most people want balloons. I couldn't answer customers questions because of the lack of training. "
bad,"Boooo awful place like being in high school! I would not recommend ever working here unless you are in real good with the click of mean girl management . Crazy, best thing I ever did was leave that place ."
bad,The manager at the Spanish Fort store is very racises she watch every black person come in there like they gone steal and let whites walk in with big bags and everything you never here anything she lazy come to work drunk over work you she have her boyfriend and these two guys come work off the clock they have a cooler full of beer and she be right there with them
bad,"Management, runs around without a plan in place, the backroom is always a disaster and a hazard to employees.. The managers GM does not like to work nights or weekends ( busy times ) and they are salaried and are never putting in their full hours, Our manager tells everyone not to bother her when she is in the store!!! No appreciation for work that you do and they focus way too much on Surveys and E-Mails, FOCUS on your store sales, inventory, and employees the customers will let you know if they are happy for sure.. 10 surveys a week is ridiculous . Need to have managers be more flexible with there schedules they should work a couple of nights and weekends once in a while!!!!"
bad,"The management was SUPER disorganized, stuff was scattered everywhere in office and dock area. Their was no real training I was kinda thrown into it and was stress out for awhile till i got it down. The customers were some of the rudest I have come in contact with! I hated the job the pay was horrible especially when you have bills to pay. It would be an okay job for teens who just want some extra money."
bad,"The job itself was ok. It was fun doing balloon arrangements and whatever, but management was evil. No chance for growth or even appreciation from GM."
bad,Was not happy the way things went down . the loss prevention vice president rail roaded me. I was treated like a piece of trash. They could not call me to office they called me via phone.
bad,"There‚Äôs an old saying...‚Äù A poor leader can destroy a great team in seconds ‚Äú. That‚Äôs what happened in  The Newmarket store.  The store was a vibrant location with a very dedicated team from top to bottom.  Then the inexperienced DM with very little ability to communicate simple messages and very low self esteem decided to make a personal decision, not a business decision, and removed our GM.  The store has since gone down quickly. If I could post pictures, they would speak volumes to the new direction the store has unfortunately gone. The entire management team walked out on this DM. Bravo to you DM you again have shown your lack of leadership to your subordinates and your cluelessness to your paying customers"
bad,"Do NOT apply for Party City. The manager is unprofessional, will ignore you, and picks and chooses when to speak to you. The manager has favoritism with the employees and speaks to people rudely."
bad,The boss was too busy hitting on all females instead of the job at hand. Made it very uncomfortable. Preferred to have others around at all times. The employees and other managers were great to work wirh.
bad,"Corporate only cares about short term goals, so stores that are still getting established often are under staffed with very limited hours creating a messy environment that cant cater to the needs of the customers. Our biggest complaints from customers was the lack of customer service and the lack of tidiness which were both direct results of having too few hours to do anything other than open and close the store with two associates running the store most of the time. Freight is expected to be worked mostly during open hours, and since most stores are too small, this results in dangerously over filled back rooms or in impossible tasks that cant be completed. The sad thing is they used to be a good company, and hundreds of employees like myself have continued to leave because they do not care about running a business, only appeasing their stock holders. "
bad,"Where to start no hours to rum a store properly, Corporate expects the impossible you will despise waking up to come in to work. Avoid at all costs I think ill deliver pizza instead Kinda serious....."
bad,The work experience at Party City does not prepare you for any job in the market. New employees are not trained at all when they arrive for their first day. The best thing about the job is the flexibility it provides.
bad,I absolutely loved what I did but because of my district manager the store atmosphere was terrible. He always made us feel like we were doing a terrible job. Told me I was not worth a raise. I don‚Äôt see this company being around much longer due to the way it operates and treats its employees
bad,It's everything you would expect of a cashier job with the addition of 2 or 3 other jobs if you are the only competent one in the workplace. Your manager will also cut pay from your paycheck if you accidentally lose money. (Which is illegal.)
bad,"the worst experience ever ! lol one of the managers would count the money in the back without the cash register person looking at her or cameras looking and if it was short you were held accountable. everyone knew that the manager was stealing and no one said anything, not even the store manager. poor newbies such as myself were like ""WTH"". (i was never short because i always asked to work the floor since i knew and heard of the situation, but i saw how people got FIRED because of this!) there was no way of proving anything and this created an issue in the work place. And no one could have told her anything not even the store manager because ... lets just say the stealing manager had black mail on the store manager. CRAZY!"
bad,"From the time I started to the time I left I watched atleast 10 people quit including several managers. All the management does is shift the blame around when it comes to store issues. Hours are practically nonexistent despite the understaffed store. They also would randomly call you to come in on days off and if you didn‚Äôt show they‚Äôd right you up for skipping work even if you told them you couldn‚Äôt make it in on your day off. I‚Äôd be lucky to get 8 hours a week during any season other than Halloween. Seasonal workers got paid more than I did, I didn‚Äôt even make enough money to pay one bill. I was hired on as a stock worker because their back room was a mess as well as the store. Completely disregarded what they hired me for brought in an outside company to do it. Also they never trained me and stuck me with a Comdata card that would scam me out of money. When I asked to set up direct deposit they suggested I make an adp account when I tried it came up that I was never in the system. When I brought this up they told me they were to busy to deal with it."
bad,fast paced environment where employees are constantly refining and developing the party business. This company dominates this category yet their stock lags behind for some reason.
bad,"Mistreated  the whole entire year I worked there. Mostly verbally mistreated by staff, I was over worked for such little pay. Messed my checks up.  Good place to get work but Alain a bad place"
bad,The Roseville party city I was only seasonal for Halloween but they didn‚Äôt communicate and had me on the mask wall for the 2 weeks I was there. It was boring and obnoxious to pick up and put masks randomly on a wall.
bad,"Managers picked and chose who had to wear the uniform or who had to show up on time. Also the distribution of work was not even, and again this played into favoritism."
bad,"It was my first day on the job and I was working with 2 managers, 1 head manager, and a cashier. Mind you, I have a speech disability. I tend to stutter when i get nervous or stressed but it‚Äôs hardly noticeable if i‚Äôm comfortable. I was ringing out a customer when my speech got in the way of telling her the total she owned and the 2 managers looked at each other and looked at the cashier then at me. Before I left for the night, I overheard the managers talking about me in the break room saying ‚Äúam I dumb‚Äù ‚Äúcan I speak correctly‚Äù ‚Äúis she stupid‚Äù just rude and unprofessional things as a manager. I do not recommend this company. They will judge you before knowing you. Awful and sickening."
bad,it was terrible working there. i wouldn‚Äôt want anyone to work there unless they can take a lot of unnecessary judgment but the pay is good and you do get a break
bad,I came to party city as my first job But after 8 moths of working here I realized they dont care at all about a single employee. The managers make all the sales associates do everything while they sit in the back and corporate doesn‚Äôt let the store have enough employees or hours they‚Äôre constantly behind on projects cause they dont have the workforce or time to do what corporate wants I recommend never working here
bad,"manager had really bad attitude and it was all over very depressed environment, manager had really attitude, not professional at all, they hate their job"
bad,"i needed money to hang out with friends while i was going to college, so i worked at party city time was flexible but pay wasn't great and management wasn't the best."
bad,This place is horrible to work at you don‚Äôt do much it‚Äôs really never busy you stand around once you have completed everything and the management is horrible they kinda shun out any new people and treat new people poorly and cut hours
bad,"A great learning curve with its ups and downs but the way that things are handled at times is questionable."
bad,My experience with Party City was not an enjoyable one. I was hired as a Halloween Temporary Sales Associate and later offered a full-time position if I stayed. It didn't take any thought to turn down the offer. The management was the worst I've ever experienced. The lack of respect and communication left a horrible taste in my mouth. I would never work for this particular store location ever again nor would I recommend anyone to this workplace unless they were under new and improved management.
bad,"my experience when working at party city, was incredibly difficult the management was very two faced when i came to a lot of the duties assigned to me. if you were standing the wrong way when asissting a customer they would scold you, if you stood in the same spot trying to catch a slight breather between duties they would belittle you. around the third month of working there i was asked to relocate to a store farther north i was given no extra pay or compensation, and when i became sick with an intestinal virus rather than give me time off to recuperate after being sick, they decided to cut back my hours as well as my pay."
bad,"Many high schoolers were hired and did little to no work, which made the older workers have to pick up their job duties. We were not compensated for this and we were promised raises but did not receive them."
bad,"both times i worked at party city i was stuck agreeing to seasonal, bboth times because it wasnt a part time or full time job they paid us a lower salary. the worst part is they lied to our faces about possible oppenings every day to motivate us to work harder and sell more. it was disgucting to be pushed nto competing to sell the most to random people."
bad,"There is no room for advancement if you're looking to make more than $8.25 an hour dont waste the application process. Management does not know how to lead, they expect you to do jobs that they are meant to do while they sit behind the counter and stare at you."
bad,"Isn‚Äôt a job I‚Äôd recommend for anyone who wants to go home with a sense of self, without a migraine, and without the thought that you‚Äôre only living to work."
bad,"I'll keep this short, Party City is a terrible place to work. No hours, low pay, no training, and (in my case) bad management. I thought these issues were exclusive to my party city until speaking with some friends who have had similar experiences. Bottom line, only work here if you're desperate."
bad,typical day was  just receiving shipment and restocking shelves and assisting customers with any products that they would require being able to call different store locations looking for different products
bad,"Management was stealing, The only team players were the Manager and Assistant Manager and they lived on a street called one way.  NO room for advancement.  Treated customers and employees like trash."
bad,"Prepared merchandise for sales floor. Maintained knowledge of current sales and promotions, policies regarding payment and"
bad,"Working at party city has been a good and productive learning curve. Party city Is a fast paced party shop filled with fustration, but that frustration results in a lesson learnt."
bad,"Very slow, there was always something to do. but it wasn't a job for me. you would blow balloons and help them with any party supplies or questions. overall it was okay job."
bad,"working here as a seasonal is pretty chaotic, people are always making a mess and the store is falling apart during Halloween time. You may work short hours but they will be irregular and fluctuate."
bad,"The DeZavala location is infested with incompetent managers, mangers who favor employees who gossip. The pay is also no substantial, pay increases are rare, and management does look for excuses not to grant those raises."
bad,Management treats you like a dog. Promotions are very rare and pay is unacceptable for the amount of work you are required to do. You are treated unfairly. Not union and no benefits except for a 30% discount. You must be management or work full-time for benefits but they don't hire full-time.
bad,"The health benefits were good. The management team at Party City wasnt very good. They didnt train me the way they said they would because when I did a planogram or other project, I was written up due to not doing the project correctly hence not being shown correct way of doing the job. I just found another job."
bad,"Management is very rude and never backs up their employees when being harassed or attacked by customers, they give customers things for free and do returns from things bought 2 + years ago (30 day return policy) just to keep 'people happy' when really corporate doesn't want to deal with anyone."
bad,"Would not recommend working there, they do not look out for employees, do not provide safe working conditions. Task load is completely unrealistic with minimal employees working in the store.terrible benefits"
bad,The most difficult part of the job is the lack of work life balance. The companies unrealistic requirements make it almost impossible to enjoy a day of work.
bad,"management was bad, hours are bad no help or teamwork, its a great place  to learn the basics in retail but not make a career"
bad,"Customer Service Acknowledge all Customers through a greeting, smile and/or eye contact regardless of the task at hand Enhance a Customer's purchase through suggestive selling to help ..."
bad,"District managers are never satisfied with improvements in looks, feel or business. Managers are over worked due to lack of hours for employees to work. As a manager i was always trying to keep moral up, but it was had when Overheads come in and destroy your staffs hopes. within my second month of working with the company, i realized it was a mistake."
bad,"This was my first job,something that was suppose memorable, but was horrible. The typical day just consist of stocking no employee to employer communication. I learned nothing really, i wish she would of took the time to help me grow into to something better"
bad,"Anyone with a thought is squelched, they move things too much, poor training absolutely the worst run company, but is profitable because the owner owns both Party City and Amscan who sells them the product. NEVER a mention of customers or employees do very little for either. HR a laugh.  So many things I could write"
bad,"This may not be the company for you.  Pay is very, very low.  Not much better than a dollar chain.  HR wants candidates with top shelf experience so they can make the company better.  Instead they just grind through employees and fire them when they burn out. Management is made up of either a bunch of liars or ineffectual people who are afraid to rock to boat."
bad,This was a very fast-paced fun work environment.  My team was a great bunch of people. The most enjoyable part of the job was watching little kids faces as they came in the door and seen all of the balloons.  I did learn that if there is no balance between home and work it really does not matter how fun the job or how much compensation there is.
bad,"I just got this job after working at marshalls for two years. I thought management at marshalls was bad. I've worked there a month and my manager is already talking badly about me to another associate, who is also my friend. This manager doesn't do anything but sit in the office. Already plan on looking for another job."
bad,"Party City has a great selection of Party Supplies, and customers throwing a party have a great mindset compared to some retail environments. However Party City Corporation has a horrible corporate culture that rewards intimidating, cut throat management styles. If you can thrive in an environment of constant threats, intimidation and retaliation, it might be for you...however there is NO work/life balance. The corporate schedule calls for 47.5 hours, however that is a best case situation, with most weeks being required between 70 to 80 hours with NO compensation. Party City treats its employees more like slaves than employees. If you have a family, stay away. This job is for a single person, who has no life or ambitions to be anything more than a servant to a corporation that does not value employees."
bad,"good employees are pushed aside for yes men.  There is no teaching here, only reprimanding for small mistakes.  Job growth for certain departments is non existent."
bad,I would not suggest working here unless you want to literally be there 24/7 with no chance for an outside life. You would have to work 9 days at a time to even get a weekend off. The upper management likes to run your over and treat you less than what you are.
bad,"So unorganized! closing was terrible because sometimes we would only stay 10 minutes after the store closes and sometimes it was closer to 2 hours. They always schedule shifts a certain way so that u don‚Äôt get a break/lunch. Directions from managers were always super vague and unclear, but they would micromanage you anyways and get mad when you don‚Äôt do exactly what they want ."
bad,Upper managment is absolutely horrible!No home/work balance at all. Very unappreciative of the hours that u have to put in to get the job done. Do not work here!
bad,"Party City is a exciting place to work. "
bad,I had some good years and a lot of bad years.  It all depends if you land in a location that has someone committed to the cause.  Caustic environment.
bad,"It wasnt a happy place to work. With a name like party city, you would think the employees would like there job. They dont. The managers dont treat the teenage workers very well."
bad,"I worked here as a seasonal sales associate over the Halloween season. Besides myself, 2 others and the managers, it was all high schoolers. They grouped together and were not too inclusive. They also didn't understand that I have a phobia of heights and instead of being understanding, they had me do tasks that involved using ladders. I have anxiety and mental issues so by trying to make me do this work, I felt really uneasy going to work. They were flexible with the hours because I had another job but with the way they didn't understand my issues wasn't professional. Maybe others had a better experience there, this is just my story. They haven't called me back for another year of seasonal work and I'm glad."
bad,Manager was rude!!!! Very inconsiderate of others always brought her family problems to work she needs to be fired!! Other than that i love the place it‚Äôs a good place to start
bad,"Party City had been a pretty fun place to work. Then it became a corporate owned store. Corporate promised no losses in hours, pay or positions. Three days later we lossed two full time employees due to termination. After that, the corporate promises of a week of training on a new system and policies that never came about. Within weeks almost a dozen people quit including all the managers as they did not agree on how corporate was treating the store employees and lack of leadership on the corporate level. Basically in a few weeks this pretty enjoyable job turned into a living hel. If the party city store you are thinking about is owned by party city company,  go somewhere else."
bad,"People are nice as they tried to help you the most that they can, but is stressful work in a environment, that people don‚Äôt respect other, is something that bothers me"
bad,One of the most stressful companies that I've worked for within the past 10+ yrs in retail management.  Life and work balance is non existent and does not matter how good of a daily task planner you are.
bad,I worked for a franchise and the person running the group was an imbecile.  He would flip flop how things were to be done on a daily basis and make you rearrange because he felt like it.  He treated the employees poorly.
bad,"blow balloons all day"
bad,"Thought it was fun to work with Halloween costumes, and props. The management was always changing or setting you up to fail. Extremely high turnover rate, the only saving grace for my personal experience is that one of the managers actually treated us like people."
bad,to say its an amazing job is a lie but its money none the less. youll find good friends and a Few great managers but dont hold your breath haha. if you want a lil extra chipotle coins then apply here cuz its easy AF
bad,"bad place to work avoid at all costs. no compensation for hard work done , it was expected , if you could work overtime once you were and are expected to do it everyday. people called in sick constantly which left the manager as the only person in the store to ring people up , help with the fitting rooms and do everything corporate mandated most of the time i couldnt even go to the bathroom because there was no coverage"
bad,This was my first job ever and I only worked here because my friends did. If it wasn't for my friends I would have never worked here. The manager is very rude and inconsiderate and the job duties are repetitive and boring.
bad,"i loved working at party city, job was fairly easy nothing too crazy. most stressful thing to do is checking out costumers when its busy and has long lines. (usually happens during holidays) and doing balloon orders in a limited amount of time. all but one of my managers had an issue with me and messed with my hours. although i worked part time i went from working friday-sun to only 1 day for like 5 hours. even if i asked for more hours id still get the same amount, sometimes none at all. one manger told me i work at 10:30 when i usually work at 10. i came to the store around 10:20 and she waited for me to come so she could smirk at me and then leave. its a great place itself but just be sure of the managers before you start"
bad,Fun and easy. Depends on who you work with. I worked a seasonal job so it was very busy during Halloween time. If there's not a lot of customers the jobs gets slow and you begin to get bored.
bad,It wasnt that great. The management wasn't nice nor were they friendly. The pay wasn't worth the hours and the stress I also didnt get many discounts.....overall I didnt have the best experience.
bad,"the pay was terrible , the managers was a person that nobody at the store got along with, the employess  were great, and that was a reason to make you come back and give 100 percent."
bad,"Management is 100% the problem with this place! Just plain rude and horribly condescending. They are NOT flexible with hours at all, they expect you to come in even if its inconvienient, if you're sick, or even if you physically CANNOT get there. When you first start out, whatever your job is there is an overwhelming amount of things that they do not teach you. You are basically on your own or have to seek help from other employees. The other employees and other managers are the ONLY thing good about the place. Not a fun place to work at."
bad,"the one  manager was not a leader and just told us what to to with min training, also messed up the direct deposit a number of times"
bad,"This is a great seasonal job. Lots of hours with lots of people. You get to wear costumes and the work is usually fun."
bad,"It was my first job, and even though I excelled, there was no opportunity for advancement because the company is extremely cheap. Also the management team I had to deal with was extremely uneducated and prejudice. Manager hired all of her nieces because they belonged to the same church. Many of these nieces were unable to work on certain days and was extremely frustrating having to always compensate for them."
bad,"Upper Management has no respect or regards for anyone below a district manager, this is since they were bought out by some investment firm, Co-workers work hard and get nothing in return, very little payroll to run a store"
bad,Company is getting rid of high paying managers and promoting assistant at half the price
bad,"This branch of Party City has managers who slack off and blame the worker for it, and they cut your hours for no real reason till you get paid almost nothing and get treated even worse. What is the point to working for minimum wage when you get 4 hours after working faithfully for 6 months already."
bad,its retail you do the same things everyday until they give you two weeks to change your entire store to a different holiday also you have to put up with balloons
bad,I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this job unless you are making it a second job you will it be able to live or raise a family off this work income. The only time you get paid good is around Halloween time witch sometimes you don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a battle for hours and if the managers have favorites like they do here they will give them hours to their close friends.
bad,"I feel like I wasn't given a fair chance. I was dependable, never called in, showed up on time, provided excellent customer service, never had any cash shortages."
bad,My old manager picked favorites (typically good looking and physically attractive males and any female she could make her pet) no matter how hard you work or reliable you are. She complained every time someone called out because it inconvenienced her. And she terminated me from my position because my car had died and I had no way to get to work living 3 towns away and no safe way to w ( I was not one of her pets)alk
bad,Partycity city took half of my 401 knowing  i had no car no nothing i worked hard fir that money i dont understand h ok w they can just tsje it from me i need that money i worked for it
bad,This place is going downhill very fast  very fast the management sucks nobody ever knows what to do and how to do it. Employees go without getting paid.
bad,"I myself worked there, I guess since I  wasn't party city material  I got the short end of the stick I had not alot of days maybe one or two couldnt switch with people who couldnt get that day off. Oh they also tear up and shred your paperwork claiming you never worked there also."
bad,"Do you like inconsistent schedules? I hope so, because you'll be lucky to make 15 normally. However, during Halloween you'll be making 50. Minimum pay"
bad,This company has gone down the drain in the last 8 years I was apart of it. The upper management from corporate expect an immense amount of work to get done with minimal payroll and not enough resources to achieve it. I would not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"It was my second job and I hated it.  Halloween is the best time to work.  Almost all of my paychecks were close to 500.  I was abused by management.  One of my managers would emotionally abuse me and countless times they would treat me like I was less than a human being.  Not to mention corporate is awful so then the employees have to face the angry customers and I was getting bitched at constantly for stuff I wasn't responsible for.  And they laid me off without even giving me a notice.  I had to text my boss the night the following week's schedule came out and she just said ""oh we had to cut hours and you were only seasonal"" even though I stayed passed the seasonal position... It's not worth the minimum wage... ESPECIALLY after halloween.  Hours are awful and you're not doing much.  If you plan on working there.  Work during Halloween."
bad,"restocking isles, cashier, sweeping, filling up balloons ad cleaning the bathrooms on a typical work day. I learned how to use math a lot more being a cashier, and being more organized. The workplace culture there was very bland and not satisfying to be there. The hardest part of my job was to help angry customers and also helping customers out finding items. The easiest part of the job was after hours cleaning up and organizing every isle."
bad,"Just way to little payroll for managers to have any time quality it life. My manager qas terrific, however the rest shared the ridiculous expectations."
bad,While my teammates are wonderful upper management and corporate are horrible. Constantly cutting hours and adding new projects. We constantly have to redo and move things. Management gets run ragged because we don‚Äôt have enough hours to schedule any support staff.
bad,"The store was poorly managed, and needed a better system of dispersing employee roles. The cashier did everything; from taking phone calls, blowing up balloons, checking out customers, answering customer questions, creating several party balloon bouquets within every hour, welcoming guests, to restocking. Only one cashier worked at a time, and it was often stressful. Managers and other workers would simply restock merchandise on the floor."
bad,The store I worked at was turning into toy city for the holidays. Me and a few other highschool workers were fired without us knowing. We were on a school related trip for a weekend and came back and had to hunt down a manager (none of them would reply) just to find out we were fired. We were all saving up for that trip and spent about 3 full paychecks and came back with all of us struggling to even get gas for our cars to go to school. We all agree that if we were told after the trip that we wouldn't have a job anymore then we wouldn't have spent what we did. Still to this day (middle of march) I am struggling on my own bills.
bad,The Corp office doesn't go by Merritt they believe a minion over a veteran..I wouldn't tell anyone to work for a company that would believe a general manager that had multiple complaints that they ignored
bad,Was good for awhile then go super busy and management sat in the back. Some good employess I met that became good friends and overall made me some money while it lasted
bad,"I worked at party city during halloween season. well, it was great that it was my first job but i would never work here again. company card drained all my money. first day i used it to get books, next day my money was gone. i was left with 6 cents in my card out of $487"
bad,"The expectations of this company are unrealistic.  As the general manager, you were expected to run every aspect of the store including cash, balloon counter, customer service on the sales floor, merchandising, planograms, receiving, payroll, scheduling etc.  There were not enough hours in the day to complete everything that was expected of you. There were many shifts I would come in two hours before the store opened and remained there until close. It is very unfortunate as the staff were great.  Corporate office needs to address the workload for the management team.  Otherwise they will never be able to retain top talent in a management role.  They would also be wise to hire management from within, as the staff understand what the business needs are."
bad,"Wasn't happy with the place. Didn't like the service they gave to the customers,places was a huge mess,no one wanted to help there,overpriced and didn't like how they had old candy out"
bad,the managers talk badly about employees. i got called out my name and talked about multiple times. the district manager also takes no action. this store is very unprossional.
bad,regular retail job helping customers being friendly to people and helping team mate. A good job respectable place to work for  but in my store my boss was made working there diffcult
bad,I worked at Party City as a cashier back in 2012/2014 when I was in high school. It was an awful first job experience for me. The environment was extremely childish and management much worse. I hope they have improved in their management.
bad,"If there was ever a situation, it was never handle with professionalism. There idea of fixing a situation is to simply fire someone. Manager should inspire not fire. I know this because I have been a manager before. Using intinidation to try to make employee more productive is doomed to failure."
bad,"management is shady, workers gossip nonstop with managers as well, managers are not consistent, as far as hours go, they dont give you consistent hours, always random, mostly lessening the hours, they dont tell employees before they are being laid off until the last minute, constantly make payment mistakes. its just a shady place and i urge people to look elsewhere as far as jobs go."
bad,"Childish management that treat you horrible and do not set an example of what a model employee should strive to be."
bad,"it was a fun place , but at the same time very intimidating. There was no team work, management made it look like a competition... but from that i learned a lot of customer service and patience"
bad,"Upper management is poor and can't seem to make their mind up when it comes to changes. Last minute changes and should've been done yesterday. Store management are nothing but  high paid stockers but is still responsible for overall operations. Their famous line is that you are ""Business owners"" . Yeah right than let us contribute our input on decisions considering  we're at store level and know what our customers need and want. Customer oriented not task oriented. That will be there down fall."
bad,They schedule without thinking about how much one person can actually handle. It was boring they don't give the morning people a break
bad,"costumes "
bad,Party City doesn't keep enough employees on the payroll to allow their workers much room for time off or vacations. They are also very considerate with raises that usually come in the form of  $0.10 increments. Its not so party
bad,"This is overall a terrible job. Bad work hours and the store manager is a nightmare. There is very little direction and even less training. You are just expected to already know everything."
bad,The days you are there are sometimes long. They require a lot from you but do not compensate. They send changes so fast that the team is demoralized onsite and sends them in tailspins on a daily basis.
bad,they give less hours to the pt-time to work and more hours for the managers to work. 
bad,So much negativety in upper management makes for alot of stress much of the time. My co-workers are awesome people and I do enjoy working with them as a team. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the sometimes unreasonably long physical hours.
bad,"I was called in to be ""part of their team"" (as they called it) when a new store was opening. I went in a few days a week and built the store (stocked, sorted, shelved, everything). As I kept going back I realized/overheard that most of the people there were from nearby Party City stores helping us. This was good and bad. Good because they knew about the store but bad because it was taking away hours from people that would be working there. However, they kept most of the people that helped. A select few of people (~5) out of the more than twenty that helped build it. When I go there now, there is NO MORE than 2 people working at a time. People are walking around clueless but they can't find anyone working because there just isn't anyone working. The management is awful and didn't let anyone know that they were just temp. slaves building the store until it opened."
bad,"Party City wasn't a place for advancement or growth, also no benefits. If you are a student looking for part-time work then party city is the place for you."
bad,It was okay working at Party City back in 2017... but now in 2019 it's gone worse. Its severely poorly managed. I went back for the season and it was a mess. Lack of leadership and communications from managers. They take FOREVER to respond with an answer when calling for backup at the register causing a line and a group of impatient customers. I noticed they tend to leave their own projects at the last minute till someone from corporate says they are coming to check up on their new store set ups. Managers expect you to go above and beyond for little assignments which can cause stress to the cashiers leaving them with little energy for the rest of their shift. Most of us didn't get our 10 minute breaks because managers weren't around to cover us. Management: Zero Stars because there was none.
bad,"Hours/scheduling was inconsistent, some weeks I'd only get 12 hours, even as a supervisor who was supposedly full time. Schedule posted for the week posted on the thursday prior, making it very hard to schedule weekend fun or trips. Management was very unorganized with mandatory inventory days, making it impossible to plan christmas vacation. Management was unappreciative of hard work and extra effort, GM often took credit for our projects and blamed us for him failures. I consistently met and exceeded corporate goals and took initiative to help with projects exceeding expectations for my position and was still passed over for promotion twice. Instead they hired out of house a manager I ended up training on register and balloons, even though she was supposed to already been trained the week before from another store."
bad,"This is a good job for teenagers just starting out in the work force, or someone who just wants a seasonal job. If you want a place of employment where employees are valued and treated with respect, this isn‚Äôt the place for you. There‚Äôs no room to move up unless you‚Äôre a ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù. The good employees are taken advantage of until they‚Äôre pushed to quitting. Pay is lacking even if you do a good job and get excellent yearly reviews you will be lucky to see 10 cents."
bad,Was only there because Job was a secure place. Management was never the best. The customer would mainly be nice but mostly mean. Not really enjoyable. Would not recommend unless needed a job
bad,It was difficult working at party city due to the constraints placed on its employees there are many issues I felt could‚Äôve been resolved very easily but both me and my managers are unable to do so due to corporate intervention the hours are very inconsistent and  soon it became an unreliable source of income it‚Äôs a nice job for somebody in high school but not for somebody who relies upon full-time hours
bad,"They only gave me minimal training so i had to learn things on my own. However, the workers are very friendly and easy going. It just wasn't the right workspace for me."
bad,"Pros"
bad,"Advancement is not consistent with ability to do job.  Hours are not given out based on job ability, but haphazardly.  As a result, morale was low in the store.  The store was never adequately staffed and it was extremely stressful to multi-task every second of the day."
bad,Not the best job I've ever had. They were extremely rude and not understanding. I have a son and was given a part time job and ended up working over full time !!
bad,"Management has become glorified cashiers due to severe payroll cutbacks. Always made sales but payroll allowance consistently went lower. Corporate culture was 'do more with less' with no compensation for it. Low level management expected to have designated responsibilities as well as cashier duties, and rarely received over 20 hrs. Cashiers working 4 hour shifts meant no continuity/organization at the register. Hardest part of the job besides the continuous absence of appropriate staff was disappointing customers because of inadequate stock on a daily basis, watching customers walk out empty handed, and being unable to assist everyone because the facility was huge and employees few and far between. Too much unnecessary busy work requiring large blocks of time simply to relocate same goods. Overuse of 'flex' everyday merchandise to make areas appear more appealing. Peak times and seasons were extremely stressful. Most enjoyable part was helping people to plan a nice event (when we actually had what they wanted). I learned that retail, with this company at least, has disintegrated and should not be viewed as a viable occupation unless you are willing to work very hard for not much money."
bad,"Loved the job working within this store. However the Corporate office people, I found, to be rude and very disrespectful to the store employees."
bad,"I would go to work, stock shelves work cash register and fill ballons for customers."
bad,"Company makes many upfront promises to get management on-board. Then there is no training, high expectations, and a very hostile work environment. Corporate HR does not listen, even when told employees were forced to work off the clock. I would recommend staying as far away as possible from working for this company."
bad,"I worked for this party city for a month and I love my co-worker and assistant Manager, but the general manager is horrible he always has an attitude and it unpredictable. You don't know what you will get. one minute he is happy and next minute he is upset. so be warned don't work for this party city if you cant handle unpredictable people. When I worked with my Assistant Manager the atmosphere was awesome and smooth running and there was laughter and fun."
bad,Great co-workers and generally ok direct management but executives don't care about the stores and constantly cut hours until the place is just a bundle of stress.
bad,Party citys management is a mess. You never know whos safe and whos not. The customers are so rude and you are treated as a slave. You dont get paid enough for what they make you go through.
bad,"I worked there for a week with no assistance of any sort. The managers were aware that it was my very first job and instead of helping me after I've tried to teach myself, they were annoyed and constantly rushed me to get things done. At the time I was 19 and coming from a seriously harsh depression, the customer relations people did not care for my story and did nothing. I quit due to the ""team"" not being a team and the management not being as understanding as they swore they were. And they hire the most ratchet people ugh. Apply here if you want to make less than minimum wage and work so many hours just to make no money."
bad,the job work be crashier and help customer with planing/ getting the basic thing they may need for any kind of party/ event you may be putinh together
bad,"Very unprofessional. They would swear and fight with brooms.  It was lovely meeting customers and helping them with their parties, but the workers at my place were just very unprofessional."
bad,The manager wasn't stable with the schedules he would be rude to most people it was just a bad job honestly. I wouldn't go back besides it was only a temporary job.
bad,"I was employed for the Halloween season. Of course rude customers who misplace items is expected & almost inevitable. However, the most unenjoyable experience while working at PC was the management. My managers were very rude & always acted as if they did not want to be at work. I ended up quitting early."
bad,Party City is a company that needs to see the importance of their employees and managers that give that 110% to and for the company. Management needs to know that corporation is behind them by giving them the tools they need to succeed especially when training new staff.
bad,the customer bonds that are made. majority of customers get what they want and leave. others are extremely rude and disrespectful. the management could be may better . need to appreciate other fellow employees for their hard work.
bad,"After working there for several months, I notfied them that I would be needing a medically necessary surgery to remove tumors. After a couple of days I was then told I would be terminated in the system. I was just barely short of reaching the requirements of FMLA. I was told that I could come back but when I tried I was not rehired. The false hope led me to me being unemployed longer than was economically feasible for me and my family. Between losing my income and the burdens of surgical needs I did not need to be led on by this company. "
bad,its a good job for a couple of weeks but I couldn't imagine working all year at the location I worked at. Although most were nice there were some miserable people working there to the point that customers would tell ME they feel bad for me and talk about how terrible they were being treated.
bad,Working at party city was lot of fun. made lot of new friends. the work was easy to pick up on. and they give you the best hours possible. i would of loved and stayed but i got my to finish my schooling up that i did and became that.
bad,"The management at Party City was very helpful with my training as well as with helping me with my day to day work, pertaining to my hours. The work load was fairly standard, however, at most times we were overloaded with work. The staff that was hired were both helpful and energetic."
bad,"typical day was always well"
bad,The company has gone downhill a little more every year. It started out as an amazing fun job. However it has gotten to the point where I dread going into work every single day. My pay is good but I'm not sure it's actually worth the stress working there brings. The decision is up to every person. Some love it there and others hate it. There is no in between. If I could find a job that provides me with the pay rate I currently have I would be gone in a heartbeat. 
bad,Just a seasonal job not worth the training to stay and pay was cheap for the amount of work done. If something came up management didnt work with you.
bad,"The hours were terrible, the people were lazy, the customers were a pain, all over was not a good experience. The pay was not worth the hassle of the job. Pretty much every other week you need to change the whole store around for a new holiday."
bad,"Party City was good. Just the party city by target is not good. The store Manager is the not professional, disorganized. I tryed to speak with him multiple times but he don‚Äôt listen."
bad,It‚Äôs ok just not a lot of hours or days to work but then I had my baby and well they didn‚Äôt understand some days I needed off so I can spend some time with my little one
bad,i think it was the worst place that i worked because there was no respect  and the manager was rude and always busy that didnt train me well and it was always bad there
bad,"They don‚Äôt clean the store daily , management is very judgemental on disabilities and people with health problems. Very dirty and unkept back room. They have no health and safety or ways you can even document anything unsafe . They sell customers expired treats for donations for their fundraisers also. When they dress up In costumes also after they put is right back into the package to sell."
bad,"It‚Äôs all you can think of for a first job. Kid friendly, laid back but management is inconsistent and shows favoritism towards female employees. Wouldn‚Äôt work there again"
bad,I called in once and they called me unreliable. Then let me go because I wasn‚Äôt catching on fast enough and asking questions caused issues with other employees. You don‚Äôt get trained properly.
bad,It is a job the I would not recommend to anyone unless you like low paying jobs with very few hours. The reason why I would not recommend it is because you are asked to do so much for very little pay
bad,"Productive place to work, management is okay but have personal issues."
bad,Fun work place great work atmosphere paid weekly .just wished it wasn't a seasonal position and wished there was opportunity for advancement but since it was seasonal position you couldn't.
bad,"I didn't like working here. I didn't get trained and was told to just watch coworkers and help customers. They said if I needed help to just ask someone else working. The way they pay you was really stupid, and the debit card would get declined so often. They pay minimum wage. I quit a week later because it was so disorganized. The schedule never came out the whole time I was there, I was training myself and stressed because of it. Other coworkers were doing their own thing, so they weren't there much to help. (Although where I worked closed, this is probably still relevant for other locations)"
bad,This had been the worst place I‚Äôve ever worked terrible hours; pay was bad and they expect way too much of you and there‚Äôs no chance of carreer advancement
bad,"Party City was my first job so I have nothing to compare to, but it taught me sales and merchandising techniques. I enjoyed working there, at one point there was a friendly family environment, but things didn't remain the same. Management changed for the worst and it became an unjoyable place to be. The job wasn't hard at all, it was so easy to do and handle, yea the hours were rough but still manageable. They were somewhat flexible with hours and days off, but they were strict in the wrong ways and I didn't approve of it. They meant well in a lot of categories, but I think they were poorly executed and handled, overall a decent work experience and would recommend to the public."
bad,its good for a first job but nothing long term customer WILL steal all the time you get no benefits except for 30% off on items. it will be a constant clean up of trash and costumes out of bags.
bad,"This job was seasonal i only worked"
bad,the hiring process is confusing!!! I receive emails to click here and enter info but every time I click on it the same  screen comes up and I cannot go any further. It is very frustrating. I know I am following directions so I don't understand what the  issue is.
bad,This kid behind me used to purposely pop balloons knowing it would scare me. The bosses did nothing even though it wasted hundreds of balloons. That place sucked.
bad,i don't think they have any more because they were absorbed by party city at least here in Fort Worth.................................................
bad,This place is a very unorganized. Rude manager. I did not like working in this place. Things are always broken A/C included. Customers could never find what they were looking for.
bad,"My job here was seasonal for the month of October, it was actually kind of slow paced because all i was doing was walking down the isle and watching people if they steal or if anything out of place."
bad,"learned how to build up a store from the inside and learned plan o grams and such.  they have a dumb hireing method though, only hire people whove worked their before"
bad,"I had a terrible work experience with Party City. The management was corrupt and was taking money from new employees, as well as stealing their banking information, particularly the one in Toronto at Keele and Finch."
bad,Not so great management and processes. Also I was pretty young as well and didnt really understand all the aspects.
bad,"Did not happen to me personally, but bosses used offensive at employees, even human resources had a terrible mouth. In my whole time of my seasonal position three people quit."
bad,"District Manager showed lack experience & respect for employees. Environment of the location at Citadel Crossing had several disregards for public & employee safety, i.e. there were no restrooms provided for the employees, severe black mold infestation in the building, without proper ventilation or air filtration, no air conditioning in the building average temperature reached over 98 degrees inside while trying to set up the seasonal store."
bad,"I got fired from this place because I was short on my register at the end of the day, and they accused me of stealing the money that I was short, also the GM would always talk bad and mean about me behind my back."
bad,"The pay sucks, the owners will stab you in the back all the time."
bad,Hard to work with schedule and rude management. Only 10 hrs were given for part time position
bad,We were understaffed so that might of been part of the reason. It was very stressful because of that. It was my first job and  they were still pretty rude
bad,"few hours. minimum wage. fun place to work. managers are the best I've ever had. Party City corporate one of the worst to deal with. Good place to get job experience, not somewhere yopu wanna work your whole life stay in school."
bad,"Manager was terrible and had clear favourites, toxic work environment, submitted leave 3 months in advance and was told it would be no problem, was then denied leave as the ""store was busy."" Low wages, no benefits, little room for advancement, unsafe practises when it came to Health and Safety, especially ladder usage."
bad,It was great until they let me go the day before and I was out of a job with a car payment after they said they were going to keep me. They can be nice.. sometimes
bad,"I mostly worked in the back pulling costumes for a number of people everyday, in a very cramped space. making sure costumes were the right size and not broken or stolen."
bad,Not enough hours. Can't move  up cause they always getting new management.  Corporate need get school how to run a business.  A district manager got move up but 2  of his stores were  in worse shape . I ever seen .
bad,"Working there was okay, I felt alone and everyone was cold to each other unless you were in college. There was no training, no breaks, managers would leave without telling or sit in the back and I would have to look for someone who could help me, was left by myself in the store during rush hour and could not find mangers, the worst."
bad,"Filled in during seasonal rushes. Stocked shelves , Store maintenance Learned inventory of he products .  This was only seasonal. and there were no expectations of having a long term opportunity"
bad,"Not worth the low pay. I was put to do manager's jobs because they didn't feel like doing it. They do not consider health a factor at all, I was texted and asked to work a 8 hour shift when they had a note stating I had a concussion."
bad,"this was my very first job out of high school. i was hired on as a Halloween temp. i was offered the job shortly after the Halloween season was over. for a first job it was fun for awhile, until people who had worked there less then you got raises or promoted over you."
bad,work the sales floor stock out product work the register help customers find product their looking for and make suggestions to plan for their different functions
bad,"Breaks were not given on time, depending on sales. The pay is very low for the amount of hours worked. Mandatory days need to be met before being fired, according to holidays."
bad,This was my first job and it was the worst. I was seasonal for the holidays and not a single manager showed any attention towards you. The management there did not treat their seasonal employees as they would treat their permanent employees.
bad,The management was extremely lazy. They would make you do their job so that they could sit in the office playing on their phones.
bad,"management is not very good over there "
bad,"The company is a party store- selling halloween costumes, to all different costumes, All accesories, kind of like a hobby store but for dress up."
bad,"This was another seasonal job, although i loved working with the public, it just wasnt a job i enjoyed doing everybody would argue over shifts."
bad,I had a great experience with my co workers and one manager but as far as the company goes they are horrible.
bad,Maybe if you‚Äôre full time you‚Äôre safe from whatever nonsense I experienced while working here. Do NOT do seasonal for Halloween. Paid us less than what was guaranteed and treated us bad
bad,"I enjoyed creating amazing balloon arrangements for customers but what I didn't enjoy was being verbally abused by several customers due to poor management. A store such as this is extremely busy. When working up front, you are expected to cash out customers, take balloon orders, fulfill balloon orders within tight deadlines, answer three phone lines and assist customers. This would be fine if management put an appropriate amount of employees up front to ensure customer satisfaction and to be sure their employees are not being put into impossible demanding situations. I would be the only one working on a Saturday and if you've worked for this company, or have even used them for your party events, you will know how busy it can be. Line-ups of over 25 people at a time, the phone ringing off the hook, and trying to fulfill 50+ balloon orders while management sits in the back office with coffee and the door closed. When I would radio them for assistance, they would shut off the radio. I am sure this could be an incredibly fun company to work for if they could change the system they have in place."
bad,I have worked for party city for years and have watch ed fellow employees waste years of their lives for this company with no job security or compensation. Their are no benefits or appropriate pay for their positions and what they intail. The company is very poorly ran and is looking to spend the lease amount of money to get the most profit and are not willing to poor energy and effort or money into making party city and great genuine company. Party city as a whole had no regard for their workers who make the whole thing happen. Awful communication. This is what I have seen across the Colorado region. I have watched managers get underpaid and work grueling hours because of the disorganization of this company. We have all missed extremely important life events that we got approved time off for and where threatened to be fired over and over if we couldnt do the impossible with no help or guidance.. or if we refused to work on the times we needed off.. I'm discussted looking back that I let myself and fellow co worked be treated like that. DO NOT RELY ON THIS JOB FOR SOLE INCOME. I was working 30-40 hours but it would always very heavily and could not count on this job to pay my Bill's. It got to a point where I was getting less then 8 hours a week... and party city was upset with me and wanted to say I was not committed and waisted their time when I sought more consistent and reasonable income..
bad,"I loved working at party city because of the customers and customizing balloon orders. Management and General Manager were very lazy and unprofessional . Management and other employees talk behind your back, but over all it was a fun place to work ."
bad,They do not care at the fact that you have bills to pay. The most hours you get a week is 12. When you ask for more hours or days they give you less. They expect you to bust your butt cleaning the store at closing time but do not pay you enough in return. Store closes at 9pm every day and sometimes we don't leave until quarter to 11pm.
bad,"The management overworked us and had unreachable demands of us. Once the store i worked for went corporate, hours dropped severely leading to having just 2 or 3 people working at a time. There were not enough of us to keep up with customer demands as well as what needed to be done in the store. The pay was also very low for the amount and quality of work expected from us."
bad,"When started it was a fun place to work with all staff including management."
bad,"The management now is terrible, they make you do things that are not in your job description. The manager is lazy and never helps. The only good thing is the discount and some of the coworkers. It‚Äôs no break room. My experience is overall aweful. Customers are extremely rude and will curse you out if u don‚Äôt have what they want which is crazy."
bad,"My experience working there wasn‚Äôt the best. Lack of communication, unprofessionalism, and most importantly not treated fairly. Work place is very stressful and not understanding."
bad,Working at party wasn't a good experience for me at the time i was still in high school and my pay right never match my work hours i was extremely disappointed
bad,I‚Äôve been there quite a long time now and the management is horrible honestly. I don‚Äôt get many hours anymore and there is too much drama at work. Would not recommend this location personally.
bad,the expectations were impossible they expected something to be done in a very short time period. there was never more than one cashier to help and it was very overwhelming
bad,Management was rude and none of the coworkers worked well together. I had only called out about 3 times and was fired regardless I had other issues to attend to such as my health.
bad,"Only paying minimum wage, sometimes will only give you 4 hours a week, did not train anybody who was kept on after Halloween season until about 3 months later. And they continually talked down on and berated new workers who did not know what they were doing considering it was their first job. Let customers threaten and harass workers. District managers are disconnected from real people and real world."
bad,"Only during Halloween would I ever work at Party City, I enjoyed it so much but after it was over it had become very stressful. Workers had become very stretched throughout the store and the chance of sitting down when business is slow is a no. I had been the only worker left after they fired everyone from Halloween and was working either a little to no hours one week to been overworked the next and only being paid 7.25 while new workers that where being hired where getting paid more."
bad,"myself and another employee that started around the halloween season were selected to stay permanently. However, it was not what they cracked it up to be. We trained the now manager and we were still making 7.25 when we finally spoke on the topic they gave us a ""raise"" to 7.52"
bad,"Party City store located in the Bronx is very unorganized and management is based on favoritism as oppose to skill. Subsequently, I've noticed that workers who don't want to work won't, less he's done, and customer service ratings go down and when you work there it brings your name with it."
bad,Management was very terrible and was very inconsistent with hours. Would not recommend working there and will never go back again. There was no enjoyable work.
bad,"There are a lot of poor things about the franchise location such as; no advancement, no raises, cut hours, 2 out of 3 managers are a joke, ridiculous favoritism and much more."
bad,"The store continually got robbed. "
bad,Experience there could've have been better. Many of the staff did not get along. There was always melodrama everyday with many of the staffs. Managers would speak poorly of employees.
bad,"typical day, Stressed, way too much to do in such little time. Hope there is enough people schedualed. "
bad,Managers go against what they tell you. Schedule is never done on time. Lunch and breaks are not on time. Scheduling errors every week. You get yelled at for things you can't control
bad,Like stated above the job is best for kids in high school or if you are trying to gain work experience. The pay starts at 7.50-8.00 and they literally work the life out of you for such trivial pay. People at management are delirious and delusional for wanting you to build the world in a day.
bad,"The store I worked for wasn't very clean or organized. product hadn't been inventoried in 4 years... we had records of having merchandise that the company didn't even sell. I started the job at Halloween City as an assistant manager @ 10.31 and moved to Party City as a Front End Supervisor and got a 19 cent raise. I could not get any hours on top of that.. My boss was terrible about time Management and frequently got upset about things not being done, when he gave us no time to complete said projects."
bad,"The employees were very rude, the managers thought they were better than every one else. While working there I was attending school and they wanted me to work until 12:30am"
bad,"The original owner of Party Pig may very well have been a decent, hard-working man, but the owners of what became the three Party City franchise locations in Austin are his children and grandchildren. They used his money to buy Range Rovers and other trinkets, but never an education, in business or anything else. So, the think they know everything about retail because that's all they've ever done, but they do not."
bad,"A typical day of work would consist of repairing items, repricing items, and being a cashier. My manager would favor the employees, letting others slack off because they were her friends. She would also assign blame. When the area manager would tell my manager she needed to change things, or that she wasn't doing things properly, she would assign the blame to the employees that she didn't like much. The hardest part of the job was working with unhappy customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to see all the new costumes and decorations."
bad,The management has changed a lot which has caused a very negative effect on the work place. I used to love working there but now I hate it.. Had to leave as soon as I could
bad,"I initially accepted the position in the corporate office on a full-time basis however once I started I was told the position was temp to perm. My manager was rude, obnoxious and probably the worst person you could ever work for - I should have left the 1st week I started however I needed the work and decided to stay with the idea things would get better. Bad decision..."
bad,I was only here for a month. Halloween time. The work place itself gets very very very busy. And messy at the end of the night. By far not my favorite place to work. And i was glad I wasn't kept as part time associate. The management was horrible. Too many grumpy and stuck up employees and managers too. Two managers I only liked and approved of me and my work skills. It was just one of those jobs where you needed to do something to get time going.
bad,"A typical day at work was very hectic due to the fact that it was October (Halloween). I learned how to better assign costume sizes to the customers.The management was okay it could have been better. My coworkers were very hardworking people, granted you had your slackers but I tried my best to avoid giving those coworkers any momentum and would remind them that their purpose here was to be productive if not they might as well stay home. The hardest part of the job was the clean up after closing on the days of October.  Helping the customers choose costumes for themselves and their children."
bad,"I would walk in & be ready to work. Ready to do something productive. I would clock in & get a drawer counted down & ready to be the main cashier. As I wasn't dealing with customers I would make sure the front end of the store looked outstanding. From this job I learned that customer service was the most important. Management is weird. Its not how I would have expect a job to be. They put out the next weeks schedule at the VERY last minute. Co-workers are friendly. It has many different culture background. A lot of young people, so much drama. I don't let it get in my way, my job is more important than anything. The hardest part of my job, is when I have to take off to take care of my grandma. When I have important scheduled appointments, it upsets them I have to take off & I have the ability to get laid off. Due to the fact they post the schedules very late. Party city, is PARTY CITY. Your suppose to have fun working there! I enjoy helping customers, I enjoy making our items display beautiful. I enjoy cleaning, actually. Blowing up balloons to create a party, I would say is the most fun!"
bad,Most enjoyable part of job was assisting customer with party selection.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is to be working during halloween. That's when everything is fast paced and you meet a lot of new employees. The co-workers have always been very friendly and we all get along great, although this does exclude the managers. A typical day at work for me was to clean up the front counter, blow up balloons, ring on the register, complete returns, and put away the go backs. The managers on the other hand are very unproffesional and will slander you behind your back. I have experienced this which is the reason I quit, because I want to work in a proffesional environment where if there is a problem we can all talk about it as a team. Would I ever go back to this company? Most definitely not."
bad,"Poor quality of managment, backstabbers, slacking coworkers, favoritism, lying, tons of apathy, little or no pay, 5 or 10 cent raises after a year, high turnover, quality people leave and slackers stay."
bad,"I worked here for a year and had serious issues with management the whole time. They expect you to do the work of the people above you while paying you the lowest. No one actually knows what they're doing there half the time and it's all clumsy and disorganized, even up to the corporate offices."
bad,"It was mostly stressful working for Party City during the Halloween season. The management didn't always schedule enough workers, or account for time needed to complete jobs. Was often required to stay very late in order to open the next day."
bad,"While this job gave me introductory experience in the retail field, I would advise anyone applying here to consider working somewhere that pays you more, respects you more, and treats you like a human being. Management and out of store management expects WAY too much with the hours and staff given. Customers that shop here are AWFUL. Some of them are nice but the majority of them are stressed out to the max and ticked off about having to plan their party. They also get so angry about balloons. It's ridiculous. This can happen in any retail work environment when you're dealing with the general public but seems as though party city harbors all the crazies. Oh, and not to mention that the store is essentially a giant playground for not only kids, but adults too. Good luck trying to clean up everything. And if you can't? Guess what, your manager/district manager isn't going to be happy. The turnover rate at my location was terrible. People would quit left and right because people found better places to work. In short, this place is a disorganized tornado waiting to close down. The only thing keeping it alive is Halloween and even then, just go elsewhere, I guarantee you that it'll be cheaper. "
bad,Being a party city sales associate during the Halloween season is an on your toes position. Always was be ready for the unexpected. Be ready for having multiple needs at one time.
bad,"Poor communication from upper field.  Upper field has no clue on how much payroll is needed for tasking and transitioning.  Store Operations does not communicate at all with buyers or merchandising."
bad,"Forced to work Every Sunday, required by corporate. Mandatory OT all through the fall season and Halloween. Unrealistic work loads and physical requirements for people to be able to work safely atop ladders Management ends up being a glorified cashier. No true decisions left up to management"
bad,"outside of the october costume rush daily routines require you to make balloons, help people find party supplies for specific party themes as well as ring customers up"
bad,"Working at Party City was one of the most unpleasant experiences of my professional career. The management team was grossly undertrained for such a task. They didn't understand the concept of delegating tasks and would frequently lash out at employees. I was already trained in cash with Halloween City, and management knew that, but all I did was walk around the store for 4+ hours and did absolutely nothing. They would also wait until minutes before closing and then give us tasks. When we obviously couldn't complete them in time, they got angry at us. It got to the point in which I couldn't stand to work there any longer and had to quit."
bad,Minimum wage paying job not enough to cover the cost of living in the area. Terrible management with unfair treatment to one another staff members. Would not recommend.
bad,I was only hired for seasonal help. The full-time staff did not like the temp help that was hired for holidays. Management was a pain to schedule around classes if you were in school.
bad,"Working here was fun at first. But that was 4 years ago. Since then, about a year ago management changed and it all went downhill. Started getting barely any hours, I had an average of 5 to 10 hours a week. Multiple occasions where the managers were rude or didn't care about the associates' concerns. When I say managers, I only mean the top ones because there are lower managers who are affected by this as well, and those people are very nice. Everyone's hours have been affected. Was promised a raise, never got one. The actual job is fine, working cashier and working the floor is not bad. Working at a party store is fun but the management makes it the opposite."
bad,This job is good for a kid working while in high school. Not for an adult who trying to get by. The management doesn‚Äôt care to much about the employees. The only you can get ahead in the company is if you know somebody already there.
bad,It was really awesome helping people come up with new and creative ideas for their parties or small get togethers but there was a big problem with communication among the managers and trying to get their assitance on returns or exchanges.
bad,"unwilling to train new employees ,verbally abusive ,hostile ,silence ,poor communication ,inconsistent scheduling ,I refuse to even shop there now honestly."
bad,They treat everyone as expendable and you will be stuck doing absolutely nothing. They also only allow women to work cashier positions and make all of the men do floor work.
bad,"This is a good company to start in as entry lvl. However, there is a HUGE lack of communication among upper management. The Human Resources department might as well not even exist. They are glorified party planner, they throw great company events and that is it."
bad,"Corporate doesn't care about you. The pay is very minimal. The management is usually on power trips."
bad,In order to be relatively successful a GM must work in excess of 60 hours per week due to payroll restrictions. Most locations have only two people on staff at all times expect Saturday. There is no opportunity to move up in the company past GM. It is difficult to create a customer service environment with no labor in the store.
bad,From me working there i watched as new management entered and old team members are being fired left and right to suite with the new management ways. Every new GM came a new crew. Because if anyone who was already there gave a opinion it was looked over. GMs tell other managers they will do what it takes to relieve this oerson of their duties no matter what the cost. And since my termination i have yet to believe it was a lie.
bad,"The only plus side is your never bored. Everything else is terrible. The manager would belittle you for any little mistake and blame you for things you weren't responsible for. You get yelled at for not taking breaks on time. When you did take them on time, they would yell at you and always say your want to run off to your breaks. Some managers would take hour long lunches but you would get in trouble for being even a minute late. Corporate expects way too much for how few people are there. There was always scheduling problems. There was never enough people. They always hired people that couldn't care less then blamed everyone else for their mistakes. You could never work fast enough for them. They pick favorites to be managers even if they aren't qualified. Their training on managers suck. Assuming you got training. If you didn't get training they expect you to know everything and belittle you when you don't. There is so much wrong with that place that you couldn't list them all."
bad,A typical day at work is ok. The management is TERRIBLE! not enough workers for the amount of work we have to do in those amount of hours we are working. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with my favorite coworkers. Nothing is really hard about Party City. The workplace is just annoying now and its poor management and short of staff.
bad,"Short work days"
bad,"report to work , establish all restock, count register,meet and greet costumers,replinish items, create banners, customer service rep at times, creating spreadsheet"
bad,"This was my first time working at a seasonal job and it is not the best job, super confusing and management didn't care. Plus they didn't schedule me for many hours since I'm still in highschool"
bad,"After 4 years of employment I went through a lot of ups and downs with Party City. Overall I met a lot of wonderful people who made the job fun, but the extremely low compensation for the time and work put into that job leaves not so great memories"
bad,"This job was a part time job that helped me get back on my feet after a difficult situation and time in my life. Loved the store however was part time and not paying enough, store needed to be renovated as well but was one of the first in Raleigh, NC."
bad,"This job is very flexible about working around class schedules if you're in school."
bad,"Tenuous position, no chance to advance, management a joke, tedious mind numbing work....all you did was empty boxes and put on self all day...store layout made no good sense."
bad,"Easy place to work"
bad,hours never steady only during Halloween season. management is a joke. no break room. no room for growth. really good for a high school students as as a cashier nothing more.
bad,"I have never had a worse employment experience in my life. The General Manager was extremely pushy, inconsistent, and rude overall. The schedule was always put up last minute and would often call me to the point of it being harrassment on my off days. I completely regret ever applying for this job and I do not recommend this to even my worst enemy. I am quitting soon and nothing would ever make me return."
bad,the place is always a wreck and the management have actually screamed at customers and employees in front of customers. Halloween is absolute h*ll. i would never recommend anyone to work there.
bad,The co worker were extremely high energy and made working there fun but the management team sat in the back watching you on camera and didn't actually try and solve problems. The management also was extremely rude and didn't care for his employees
bad,"Was hoping for the perfect part-time job while finishing up school without taking on too much."
bad,"A typical day consisted of an 11 hour shift that was just standing around. I would organize and do all the tasks given efficiently and fast, but there was no other tasks given after. My management was mean and no understanding. My co-workers did drugs and came to work high. They spoke inappropriately to one and other and management did nothing. The hardest part was waiting for a task to come up for me to do, and the best part was working with the customers to find everything they were looking for in the store."
bad,"The management at Party City is helpful and understanding. Party City is a great place to work especially if you are a college student. Management understands that school comes first. This is my second job and management works completely around my schedule. The worst part of the job is during the month of October. October is the busiest time of the year, due to Halloween. The best part of the job is working with the co-workers. The people here are genuine and helpful."
bad,Management was not concerned with their employees. They expected projects to be done in unrealistic time frames and would not bring in help when necessary. Customer service was not managements priority either. Party City is a company in which an employee could bust their butts all day with no real reward.
bad,On a slow or busy day you are left alone to basically run the shift while the manager sits in the office and watches you struggle . The manager only comes out of the office for a void or return. On busy days there is only 3 people working including the manager and they watch the store fall.
bad,"Deliveries almost everyday"
bad,Under Paid and Horribly Managed. The staff is nice but the management from the corporate office is terrible. What else would you expect.
bad,enjoy the associates  they are all hard workers who I try to get to enjoy their jobs
bad,Fun place to work.  The pay increases are almost non-existent.  No advancement opportunities.  All but 4 employees are part-time and only get scheduled 25 or less hours so they don't have to offer benefits.  Management are not very well trained in management.  (If at all)  High turn over because it's more of a in between workplace than a career opportunity.
bad,I was the main cashier so a typical day for me was managing the front and taking care of most of the customers coming to check out. Learned how to use the cash register and deal with money. Also dealing with many different personalities at the register helped thicken my skin for retail jobs. Hardest part of the job was dealing with managers who didn't wanna do their job. Don't regret my time there though because I did have many fun days at work.
bad,"I was almost always the main cashier at Party City whenever I was scheduled to work a shift.  I would log on to the system, count the drawer, and then begin ringing up and bagging merchandise.  It was a fairly predictable and monotonous routine.  When it got busy, I would call one or two back-up cashiers; when it got slow, I would re-direct my attention toward neatening up the front of the store."
bad,The co-workers are very helpful and understanding and very generous.
bad,"A typical day at work would be to stock and fill your designated areas, unload and receive shipments. The co-workers would be very nice and helpful. Hours are very limited, only promised more then 30+ hours if full time, which no one is unless your a manager."
bad,"This is a relatively easy job, but they expect way to much work for minimum wage. Sometimes the management will even have you help them out with their duties so that they can get what they are supposed to do done in time. And they do not give raises. The management is nice and will joke around with you but they aren‚Äôt very flexible with their hours. You are expected to work every Saturday, and complain if you ask for days off. One thing I noticed while working there is they do not keep their employees very long. I worked there for almost but less than a year and besides the managers, which there are 3, there was one other person who worked there longer than I. My favorite part about the job was working the balloon counter and my least favorite thing was doing top stock and how no matter how much there was, if it took over an hour, they would get on you for it. I enjoyed most of my coworkers company, and got along with them."
bad,"the manager was not professional in my eyes at all because she was very forgetful, scheduled the majority of the hours for herself or other managers, unfit and unsanitary climate control as well as restroom for employess."
bad,Working here is only good during the peak season which is halloween. Store becomes extremely boring to work at and they dont give as much hours.We dont get as much customers.
bad,"Was not the best working experience."
bad,The only reason I stay is because of my discount other wise than that I don't make anything for money well atleast not at this franchise and I was given manager powers during the very busy Halloween season and did all the same work as a css without the pay
bad,Desde el personal de R.H. y jefes de tiendas p√©simos c√≥mo l√≠deres con todo su equipo de trabajo y falta organizaci√≥n dentro de las Tiendas
bad,"Your basic retail work. Nothing special. Customer service is basically your main duty. Stock shelves or handle the registers. They've got a balloon counter, which is something I guess. Pay is low, but that's kind of expected."
bad,If you were just a peasant (cashier) you were left out of everything. You were considered a dime a dozen. The leads and management would have private side convos over the walkies...and you were forced to listen to it while trying to interact with customers at the register. No matter how great you are ...there is no room for advancement. It‚Äôs a basic job with basic people for basic pay.  I‚Äôve worked in 2 stores and both were very HS like
bad,There were too many cliques. Operations manager was only 21 and had no concept of what work was. Stood around and goofed off with the high schoolers. People always calling off. Nothing cleaned. Work not completed. Two store managers in a years time. No consistency.
bad,"Management was terrible. I was hired as a temporary part-time employee, and was one of the best, but when I applied for a permanent position, they denied me. The pay was OK, but it was annoying having to deal with customers (most of them were terrible, and rude). The management messed up my social security number, and couldn't change it, so I had to go to corporate just to get it fixed so I could file my taxes."
bad,"The company doesn't pay sales associates enough so they all quit not long after being hired. Shrink is high. The gm passes her tasks to others and leaves to go home. The gm also talks on her phone to her boyfriend 95% of her shifts which is against company policy. There is no loss prevention, so in a lot of the stores many people steal without being noticed. Low staff and no security equals high shrink. There are many times when the manager on duty has to be the cashier or blow up balloons which takes away from the projects at hand. Upper management sends a planner that has tasks to do, but not enough resources, but they expect you to figure out how to do it. If one manager negates their duties the whole store falls behind."
bad,"Hectic day, customer service skills were sharpened, management was poor and unwilling to assist at times, everyone was unhappy, pleasing customers was satisfying yet very difficult at times due to poor management and staffing."
bad,"You like a boss who does nothing but complains about their terrible life outside of work for 2 hours after you were suppose to leave to go home?"
bad,When I was working there I was over worked and under paid. the workers were stealing money out of the cash register. some of the workers did drugs in the inventory room. I worked shifts with out break and they would take money out of my pay for breaks that I never took. they would also cheat me out of my hours and not give me full pay.
bad,"they barely give you hours, don't recognize your accomplishment, always telling you wrong, not fun unless you are friends with the management team. the store itself is always calm so if you like that the job is the perfect fit for you."
bad,See above. No-one has any idea whats going on anywhere. No vision. No strategy. No nothing. A bunch of idiot apes steering the company into oblivion. Avoid at all costs.
bad,"not super busy on weekdays saturdays are busiest with balloons. didnt really learn anything useful. management can use work, workplace can be fun at times but mostly just drama. job is super simple and easy nothing hard about it. and i think the most enjoyable part of working there is meeting the nice friendly customers"
bad,"Working at Party City felt like trying to clean an airport hangar with a toothbrush. The amount of tasks one person is given every day is exacerbated by the lack of employees, and severally cripples the business, as we as overworks the employees."
bad,Management just sucked. The person who was the worse is still employed. Ridiculous actions if Management cause two managers to quit. Lots if dysfunction
bad,"The work is slow, get shifted once-twice a week unless it's Halloween, overall boring. Management isn't very well. Advantage: Allow for piercings and colored hair."
bad,"The day to day duties were fairly straight forward. I had a good understanding of what needed to be done, But management wasn't always a reliable source and many duties weren't clearly given. Sometimes managers wouldn't know what had to be done or how to go about the daily chores. I feel the job is applicable to anyone with half a brain but the high ups make it frustrating to keep a consistent work flow. I was interupted from my work very often to be told what else I was intended to complete. Not everything can be done at once and my superiors couldn't seem to grasp that."
bad,"Mondays through Wednesdays its usually a fairly easy to handle. But on a daily basis its stressful to handle store projects along with daily theft attempts within store grounds. Weekend days are the most fast paced days throughout the year, specially graduation season."
bad,"Some managers tend to pick favorites, and sometimes come off as very immature. They gossiped like highschoolers and sometimes would say disrespectful things about customers over they left"
bad,"I worked there through halloween and up to graduation season. I was given a shift a week but was often called to cover someone's shift. I was paid minimum wage the entire time i was there with no chance of increase of pay. The GM was terrible and rude. It was a high school job, but I would have rather worked somewhere else."
bad,"Management was not good, making perverted remarks. Owner paid cash under the table for OT, wouldn‚Äôt allow us to clock in. Did not have a license for their lift. Ladders were broken."
bad,it was a fun place to work but mostly an after  school job for kids  no real job future just first time job experience no advancement or pay raise jost a job
bad,"I was harassed almost everyday by fellow managers because I am the youngest without a family of my own. I worked full time and went to school. I had to work until 2am to 5am during the halloween season and still had to go to school at 7am. There were days I didnt get to sleep. The customer base is also very irate. They want freebies all the time. I would not reccomend working for this corporation. The job wasn't a hard job to do. It was super easy to set displays, fill balloons, and do returns."
bad,"I worked at my party city as a halloween seasonal employee and it was the worst job I ever had. Customers are rude, staff is overworked and stressed from management breathing down their necks for help, and it is overall not worth it"
bad,"Management and Corporate are horrible and very demanding. Often expected to work extra hours even if you do not want to. Pay is horrible. Never enough staff members scheduled for shifts, so employees are often running around and being overworked. Holidays are crazy there, especially Halloween."
bad,"i was hired there during the Halloween rush. my first day I was sent home after just working 2 hours. the next day it was the same. the manager laid me off, saying she overhired. but I was eligible for rehire. the little work I did was very easy."
bad,"Please do not be more than a temp here. The pay here is underwhelming. Depending on the location, people can be a pain to work with, not understanding the difference between customer service and customer servants. "
bad,"stay focused "
bad,After turning corporate the real valves went away just a big mess after you go from knowing your employee to just looked at or treted like a number. And plus the manager was the greenest person ever.
bad,"Halloween was a very exciting time to work at Party City, besides that though it wasn't very busy and I felt like I wasn't growing from the experience. The managers were very rude and inappropriate, often yelling at employees in front of customers."
bad,"Poor management. Promotions are almost unobtainable, and managers play favorites. Store is often very busy, and very short staffed. The job itself is fairly easy. Consists of typical cashier duties, filling balloons requests/reports, and store recovery."
bad,"fun place to work most of the time. made some new friends there. but on more than one occasion its been said out rite that"" its a woman position and men are there to lift things"". co-workers were very nice people. it was usually enjoyable to work there."
bad,The store along with management weren't very personable. They'd let their personal lives get involved in the workplace. The store was also very unorganized.
bad,"lack of structure"
bad,Apop up store by party city. If you like dodging screaming children and picking up large amounts of things that people rip apart and toss all over the ground then this is the job for you. This job is terrible.
bad,Its an easy job. Great for a part time or first time job. The management is good. That being said there isn't any room for advancement. The pay is minimum wage so in order to make ends meet you have to get a second job. The work isn't challenging but the people you meet make up for it. Its a job.
bad,Work was work. There were fun days and days you wanted to rip your hair out. I enjoyed being on register duty. Working on the floor was death.
bad,"Halloween was our busiest time of year which helped thousands of people find their perfect Halloween costume. Other than Halloween, balloon orders always kept us busy."
bad,There is work all the time. One of the things you learn is to work and customer service is the strongest better. The job is to keep the entire store in order pick and as well coordinated plan of work to be undertaken by each employee to your office for everyone to do an excellent job and that the customer is satisfied with the service provided and will always find what you want like to have always up to date inventory and office in order.
bad,"Typical day was finding out your job for today whether you were a roamer, who cleaned the aisle, or worked in the back and pulled costumes for the person who called it back. Also working the wall the person who dealt with customers and called back for costumes "
bad,"Working here is okay, but it can get immensely frustrating."
bad,"DM only worried about what makes him look good."
bad,"I did not work here long mostly because I got an offer working on a film set out of town, but I didn't even want to go back because of how much I hated it."
bad,"I had a great time working there, progressed quickly, and got along great with the management. Was very busy around the holidays, and very productive. Unfortunatly, the management will watch you do something that you were informed ws not agnist company policy, then terimnate you over it, without ever saying something about it."
bad,"Everyone got along, I learned alot form this job its my first job and I have been working here for four years. My co workers make my day. halloween is hard. Managers were also the hardest part, they all have their own set of belifes of rules."
bad,horrible place to work. no matter what mangement tells you expect the opposite.
bad,Typical retail party discount store emphasizes on its employee's to sell without getting commission from sales.
bad,"It was a good choice for a 1st job.  Everyone should work retail at least once in their life and this was my choice.  The employees were amazing who I worked with, every day was for sure busy.  Very fast paced.  But you really need to know that customers will not treat you with the best respect.  Low staffing caused tons of problems, holidays were terrible.  You really have to put pros and cons together for this job."
bad,"Not a lot of room for advancement. "
bad,"Managers are rude to employees and customers, like to pick favorites, and lie. Hostile work environment! Love the place and work but the managers make it unbearable for the ones that aren‚Äôt their favorites. They will talk to you like a child."
bad,Not the best job but something is something . Some people‚Äôs attitudes were bipolar so it affected you too . Little mistakes get taken serious but I suggest they train the new employees better and have more time training them in person .
bad,Started here when it was franchise and it was a great place to work!! Then corporate took over and it went straight downhill. It was a shame really. Now that store does a fraction of what they used to do.
bad,The management is horrible. Advancement in the company is promised but never given. Employee reviews are unheard of. Care for employees is null and void. Pay is terrible and limited.
bad,Party City was very stressful. Weekends were the worse. Our managers never took up for us. Customers ran all over us. We had a huge theft problem. It just was not a great time.
bad,With my old GM I got up to 38 hrs a week. Which was good because I have 2 children. But once she left I got cut down to 4-11hrs a week. So I had to leave because me and my children can‚Äôt survive off of that.
bad,Party City does not care for their employees well being. All they care about is making as much money as they can. When you first start working there is seems pretty great but give it a few months and you'll see how toxic the place really is. Its a great temp seasonal job but if you stay past Halloween you'll see how bad the place really is .
bad,"I didn't work here very long but I couldn't do it anymore. The managers are bad at training they put you in bad situations and all sorts of things. There is no loss prevention, people steal and they dont care. They suck at training.  Upper management sends a planner that has tasks to do, but dont have the resources to carry them out. It's a sucky place to work. Dont even bother trying to get a job here."
bad,"Was a frustrating experience, a lot of overworked ""bottom of the totem pole"" employees and a seemingly uncaring management. There is a big rift between employees and upper management. Company is cheap, they do the bare minimum whenever possible. Definitely a company that focuses on their bottom line rather than their employees happiness."
bad,The upper management reshuffled more than once during my tenure and we all do relearn out jobs at the busiest time of year.  GM's were expected to work 70 hours a week no extra pay and the upper management called to see if you were there.
bad,"This is an honest review as I knew the owners of this franchise. Six years, regret every hour worked not worth the $9.50hr. No regrets in walking out."
bad,party city was not a fun place to work because of the poor management and the hours were bad i would say the only good thing was the customers because they were nice and friendly and the co workers were the exact same nice and friendly and helped you with anything but the poor management made the whole experience less eventful and fun like it should be and not to mention that is you cleaned a section and did all of the work they would just keep throwing stuff at you and don't  say anything else like you did nothing while they stood around and talked about what they were going to do later and we also had one manager who was done with everything and went on lunch and never came back to work
bad,"party city can be a fun place to work if you make it one. Normally I had a good time working there especially during Halloween. I learned how to make balloon bouquets. Organized balloons and made a spreadsheet  for the cashiers. Stock empty shelves and change prices when needed. Customer service was a top priority there. It is busy on weekends and holidays. I would answer phones, greet people, make balloon orders and cashier usually all at the same time with a smile plastered to my face. I loved it when it  was really busy and when it was slow I cleaned or organized."
bad,"i was a temp for halloween for 4 years in a row. they hired a girl that got cought drinking in the back room over me, the person that did everything while everyone else slacked off"
bad,"This place was a mess in 2017. We had robbery issues, managers leaving, one manager was very inappropriate with teen girls and brought a gun to the store, he was eventually fired toward the end of Halloween. This same manager was also very unfair, only giving raises to the teenage girls. The management didn't enforce any rules so everyone sat around and talked."
bad,very poor management. they set rules in place for everyone to follow but never followed them themselves. no place for advancement. would have taken me 5+ years just to advance to next level. no communication at all on a variety of things.
bad,"Working at PC is fun, enjoyable, and entertaining to say the least, that is until your managers start losing their minds and begin to slack off. Things where rarely done at my store, and the employees where always blamed for the issues. The problem was, most of their workforce where middle and highschoolers who didn't take the job seriously. As such, nothing got done, and the managers never saw anything. It was rather disastrous."
bad,"Party City was a fun place for the most part.  Employees  were given a lot of leeway to make their own decisions. It's a fun place to interact with customers, because they are there for a happy occasion."
bad,"The staff at individual stores are caring, fun people who deserve to work somewhere they won't constantly be over stressed trying to complete an unrealistic project list with a skeleton crew and unfair compensation."
bad,"The management is constantly changing. There are hierarchies that make it hard to advance. You barely get days off, but hours are still somehow trash."
bad,"Stressful busy, fast pace environment during the holidays. absolutely no hours given in between the holidays and most workers get laid off or quit after halloween."
bad,GM would not work with schedule and expects me to know things that was not taught to me during training and would be belittled for it. She also would not work with my schedule while having another job. Another manager would talk to me about inappropriate things and would talk to me about it during work hours. GM would shrugs it off and does not take action in his behavior.
bad,-Very quick pace
bad,The managers used to stand around and talk all day while drinking Sugar Free Red Bulls. The place was always dirty. It was a stressful environment to work in.
bad,"They will pay ok to get you but then regret paying and fire you because you make too much lol. Don't waste your time and years and hours. Overnights, 12 hour days, seven day weeks......and if you want to use your time accrued, vacation or personal, remember there is always a party, always a holiday/ season......"
bad,This is a really good job until the mangers start yelling and rushing you to do orders while they sit go sit in the office all day.the hours change so much you get confused. The pay period is confusing. Depending on what manager you have the rules and the way things go and flow changes. Mangers can sometime be rude and nasty.
bad,"It's been so long since I worked there. I do remember getting barely any hours at $5.50 an hour, well below minimum wage, even at the time. I also remember it being painfully boring."
bad,Never a dull moment. Management was not the best. typical work day was to go in take care of any stock that was in the back room. Do all the returns and help customers with any help that was needed.
bad,"most days we just stayed in the back of the store. "
bad,"You come in an hour before opening, do your basic duties such as fulfilling balloon orders, counting your register, cleaning the windows and sweeping. Then it gets hectic when there is only 2 employees and one manager who won't do anything."
bad,Good job until post Halloween season. 30+ hour work weeks turned into 6 hour work weeks and will lay you off without telling you that you're laid off (no hours on schedule). Halloween season is good season job.
bad,"I worked at Party City from August 2015- October 2015. I was a seasonal sales associate. My first day of ""training"" was anything but that. The person who trained me didn't really help me for more than 20 minutes, then left me alone on register. The management was kind of awful with the exception of one or two of them. They all vaped in the back room and gossiped about each other. The staff also started lots of high school drama, even in front of customers. The only enjoyable part of the job was when I was with a co-worker who didn't really want to cause drama. I believe it all depends on who your management team is."
bad,"The tasks to be done are rather mundane. Can be pretty fun during the busy season but it is short lived, there is very little room for advancement and no real incentive to pursue any more responsibility. The hours are pretty flexible however, making it easy to go to college for me. Good for entry level money and retail experience."
bad,Extremely boring short 5 hour shifts. Its a good job for a high school student. I worked there while i was in high school for that reason. it balanced work and school.
bad,Manager of my store stole money from the safe and tried to blame another worker. Manager got caught in act and left. 2 people left while i worked there and only one person was hired back on.
bad,I have an auto-immune disease. While working here the managers didn't care if I was puking up my guts up or about to pass out. Under-paid for having to do 5 jobs at once
bad,Hours are based on emails. Even managers get very little hours. The discount is not very good. The company does not seem to value their employees. Good for a first job but not for a career.
bad,"At party city we had a variety of jobs that needed to be done balloon orders, ordering certain party favors to the store etc. it was quite a bit but it was different and also a very friendly environment."
bad,"the job it self was easy but the management did not know how to prioritize the work load."
bad,"A low pay seasonal position where one can wear costumes to work. It's mong the more fun jobs that ive worked at, and id be willing to work there again, just for fun."
bad,"Not a whole lot to say. "
bad,"I actually worked at 2 locations.  The first one was awesome, the managers were all great and we barely had anything to do.  Then the location closed down due to lack of business and I was transferred to a terrible store.  The managers were an absolute joke there.  One spoke poor english and literally got mad at me for not blowing up balloons when I had a constant line of customers.  Okay, what are you doing where you can't help out?  Then there were two other managers both named ed.  One ed was so grumpy every single day and treated everybody like garbage.  The other one was the GM, who did NOTHING.  He would walk the aisles for 10 minutes a day after sitting in the office making personal calls and watching tv for 6-7 hours.  You would literally forget he was even there.  I mean, what kinda company is this?  What do they even need gms for?  I'd like to know what they're actually supposed to do all day every day besides sleep in the back and collect a paycheck.  They'd put the tills out and make each ""cashier"" count them.  Shouldn't they be doing that?"
bad,"The company itself is extremely uninterested in hearing what the store managers have to say. Arbitrary blackout days make it near impossible to take time off. Little to no path for advancement, and they would rather hire from outside the company than promote from within. There was constant needless reorganization of products and their locations making a consistent feel for your customers nigh impossible. Management goes out of their way to stifle any innovation or initiative. The only warm spot in all of this was the ability to make some of your customers happy, but were unable to relay their recommendations to the company."
bad,"Party City has a fun corner of the retail market. Being a party supply company leads to many interesting customer interactions, and fun times to be had. However it is held back by poor management and a ""club"" atmosphere. Promotions rarely relied on job performance, general and assistant managers often leave early or take extended breaks. Because of the constant switching of holiday themes there is a lot of work to be done on a monthly basis, unfortunately district managers get bonuses for coming in under weekly hour allotments. This leads to large morning crews to finish store projects and skeletons crews during the busiest days and nights when projects can't be worked on as much. Compensation is very low for a work place that thrusts many responsibilities even on non management team members. Management compensation is dismal. Raises are done on a store wide basis based on store wide goals instead of individual accomplishment."
bad,"Party City follows the same management and associate staffing structure of many small businesses.Small staffs, limited and inexperienced managers. This puts most of the responsibility on the store manager to handle the day to day business duties."
bad,"Absolutely loved my job for the duties that were required. Putting together balloon orders were my favorite. Learned how to multitask well, work in an environment that is fast paced, and learned how to work well on my own. Hardest part of the job was having no teamwork, or help from co-workers. Most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smiles brought to children and customers everyday. I am very outgoing and love building friendships with my customers and making sure every customer left without being upset."
bad,"Typical day at work was stocking shelves and helping customers."
bad,"The store may be called Party City but it is far from fun like a party store should be. This company has no training program at all. If you don't know something and ask questions, they get frustrated that you don't already know. The work environment here is always hectic and the management is poor. The associates are okay to get along with but it is management that brings everyone down.The hardest part of this job is working in a store that you thought would be fun to work in but it is anything but. They treat people like they are mindless and sometimes treat you like you are so below them. This is not happened to me but I have seen it happen to other co-workers."
bad,"This is a good job for a young high school or college student."
bad,"A great job for a high school student. Fun environment and always have party ideas for upcoming events.But they pay minimum wage and give less than 20 hours a week,so if you have bills to pay this is not what your looking for."
bad,Worked as a temp for the Halloween season and thought it was good at first.  Liked cashiering and my coworkers.  Some of the managers were nice but others were not.  You had to work so many hours during your shift to get a break and then you get told that you can't have one while everyone else gets one.  Noticed that high school kids get favored more and when the Halloween season is up you get let go while the other temps get highered on at a regular worker.
bad,"it not what you expect , co workers are okay but not so much of a team player"
bad,Worked for company for 6 years continuosly throughout last years of high school and some colleg was never offered a full time position at my location or any other passed up for a management position for an out hire. Recived less than a full dollars raise in pay since starting out with the company.
bad,"I only worked for Party City a few months one summer when in college. My management was fine, no problems there, but the other employees I worked with were mostly Latino and didn't speak English well or at all. Thus, I was stuck working register and doing all the customer interaction type positions all the time while others got to stock the floor, set up displays and do other work. I just don't like doing the same thing everyday, so I disliked that set up, but again, it was just a summer job for quick cash between semesters anyway. I do recall the store I worked at had a policy set by the owner, not my management, that required only women be cashiers. No men were allowed to work the registers, which not only is unfair and sexist, but made me wonder how a male got into a management position if he was never allowed to ring a single customer up."
bad,"a good company to work for with good benefits. 52 hour work weeks, fun job, but stressful, around halloween"
bad,Great job to go to school and work at the same time. the hardest part of the job is valentines day.
bad,"I was not treated like a human being while working here. The whole experience was not good and I am very glad to no longer be apart of the ""Party City Family."" It seemed like others had more benefits then others to where if me and another coworker got in trouble about the same thing i would get punished to where she had nothing happen to her."
bad,Party City offers a reasonable compensation package but limited paid vacation (one week per year for the first 2 years) as well as a minimum 50 hour work week. During October shifts start at 5am and hours rise from 50 to almost 65 with 6 day work weeks and 12 hour shifts.
bad,"I love this job, i loved the people, and i loved what i had to do but working only an average of 4 hours weekly is just not something i can live off of"
bad,"disorganized, poor management, poor HR, and angry customers."
bad,"I enjoyed working for Party City when it was a franchise store. It was fun, productive, customer and detailed orientated. I learned quite a lot about merchandising and product display. I was trained in all areas of retail. I did opening procedures as well as closing procedures.. I interviewed potential employees and also hired employees. I did all the paperwork, I learned receiving and shipping methods. I feel I am well rounded in retail due to this company."
bad,"So far the benefits of party city(in oregon ave whitman plaza) the work is very busy and they have me transitioning from different positions such as working on cashier, stocking, balloons and costumes. Which is not bad I‚Äôm glad that I gain experience from working in a retail store. The customers sometimes can be petty or impatience or messy a few times but overall they are neutral sometimes. The main problem is the days they have me working. Sometimes they only have me working for one day"
bad,Worked well and had many great reviews in regard to my customer service but was let go due to me going to school. Was told that in order to stay I needed to have open availability
bad,"I was a seasonal worker starting off, but was promoted to stay on the job after the season was over. We did not have enough workers, so it was more pressure put the employees. The pay rate was low. I only started working there to have a second job. I left because school started back."
bad,"I worked there for years with promise of promotion that got ripped out from under my feet each time. Only gotten one raise in the 4 years I've been there. Management changes frequently and there is no stability of work environment. Low pay, stressful environment,  I had to get out when I couldnt take it anymore."
bad,I didn't like the management and I also thought that the hours provided could have been better since that was the only job I had and I was only receiving about 15 hours a week.
bad,"Good company, poor management... I believe the company wants to head in the right direction, but need to do a better job of hiring managers... Loved the customers but need a better return policy."
bad,Retail job they were only hiring for seasonal purpose  I was fired without a warning or write up other than that it was a friendly job I couldn't complain.
bad,Management would stop by once  week and thats it so employees were lazy unmotivated and unhelpful. i was there 2 months and within the first week i became a supervisor
bad,"before corp took over and it was franchise owned, it was a great place to work. now its too hard. micro managed to the point of stressful anxiety. no payroll hours which means no employees in the stores to help the customers. no employees to process freight so customers can't find the products they need."
bad,managers are extremely disrespectful . The customers are ungrateful and disrespectful as well. The paid time for vacation was took by the general manager. I never got paid time off i always got written up for things that were false. The store is very nasty. The have rats that eat the candy and is not safe health wise for children and adults
bad,"I worked at Party City for only a month because I was seasonal. During my whole month there they assigned me as a cashier but never fully taught me the skills of a cashier. A job which holds a lot of responsibility since you are dealing with money. For two weeks I wasn't doing ""order fulfilment"" for the balloon orders and was then yelled at in front of all the customers and my coworkers by my former manager although I was never taught about it or even knew about it. Then I was told I would become a permanent worker but was soon let go without any reason why."
bad,Good place to work at. Although a lot of pressure put on store managers with different programs and very challenging to manage with constant seasonal changes.
bad,"Manager wqs pretty rude and disrespectful, didnt stay there long. They hire and fire a lot, i was never told i was a seasonal worker until they fired me. could care less for this place."
bad,"Party City was not the best company to be working through, but I am glad that I had the chance to progress my work history. The company gave us cards to use that benefited them, and taxed us. That sucked. Also, management sucked."
bad,"We are under constant stress of completing tasks in unreasonable time frames with bare minimum payroll hours to handle not only tasks but also provide customer service to the customers in the store. Most of our customer complaints come from a lack of help in the floor but we can't put people on the floor because of our lack of payroll to do so. Their breakdown of payroll hours show a complete lack of knowledge of  how an actual store operates; we are give 8 hours a week dedicated to Balloon Counter, for example, which is by far our most time consuming area of the store and those 8 hours are spent on a Saturday alone, if not more during our busiest times."
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of checking customers out, being yelled at for our return policy and prices, and low staff. The schedule is VERY inconsistent and coworkers lack communication. The environment is very stressful around seasons, on top of that, corporate adds to the stress with adding inventory and sales for busy weeks. Though, I have to say I have a lot of fun working here because the nice personalities of the associates."
bad,It wasnt good dindnt like it would much rather be at home dont want to sell stuoid costumes no no dont work  her e not fun ok? no goood very bad stay home yes yes
bad,"was a full time manager, here but had sucky hours, only peak times are Halloween, after that it slow days, i would only work here if you need a part time job"
bad,Some customers did not understand that certain prices were set by a different company and that as a Party City employee I have no control over that. They also did not seem to comprehend despite our warning and requests to keep their receipts in order to exchange or return items. The managers never promoted a positive environment and clearly favored some employees more than others. Not only that but it was clear that the General Manager had a blatantly obvious bias when making the schedule.
bad,The job is stressful have to map out each seasonal set then figure out how to set and fill with limited payroll hours.  It is a good job for some one going to school not a lot of hours for part time associates.  Not a got job if you don't like to get dirty and perspire.  You unload you own trucks sometimes by yourself.
bad,"For a first job its really ok, they're just really bias and unfair to the workers. Its not that flexible either, but some but not all co workers will treat you with respect and work as a team."
bad,My review for why I quit my job at party City is because I got low hours and you only got 3 request days off for 4 months total. Most of my managers were nice one was very strict.
bad,"Good first time job, but unorganized and unfair at times. It is a fun job and good for first timers and if you are looking for a seasonal job. But they are unorganized, wrongly fire people, and did not want to pay me."
bad,I loved working there but my manager was awful. She always chose favorites and if you weren‚Äôt in her click you got passed up for promotions and hours.
bad,"like all temporary jobs, they treat their employees like slaves. No organization to the store and you were stuck cleaning hours after your shift has ended at the end of the day."
bad,"Stressful environment "
bad,"Upper Management place a lot of pressure of the lower management and employees for little pay."
bad,Okay job if you like to stand and do nothing. You we're not allowed to go help other departments you had to stay right at the cash register the whole time and be busy even when there was nothing to do.
bad,Management was disorganized and unprofessional. Failed to consider that I was a high school student who needed sleep and time to do homework. Put me in situations not part of my job.
bad,"In my experience with Party City, I was worked to the bone as I was scheduled full-time shifts and was expected to manage whole sections of the store, such as the warehouse or the order wall. "
bad,I did not like the managers and I do not like that I have to fill this out and think about that terrible work environment that was my first job ever..
bad,this was an ok place to work..more suited to the younger high school/ after school job.. not a lot of hours available as they are only busy during the holidays
bad,"The only thing fun about this place was the co-workers (if you got along), everything is based on favoritism and depending on the mood of management thats how they would treat you, which determined your day. No room for advancements."
bad,I learned front end oriented routine.  It was a job for someone in high school or right out of high school trying to save some money. No advancement in the work place
bad,i enjoyed the people who worked there it was a fast pace job we had to work fast and hard but for minimum wage mcdonald‚Äôs even pay more then this job but it‚Äôs great if looking for a little extra cash or a high school student
bad,When i started to work for Halloween City it was a good job I did it for 4 years on seasonal the job was poor had less hours of break and I was always exhausted for the next day
bad,The culture of this company causes a lot of unnecessary stress.  The store level management can be fun but with corporate constantly  changing rules and never supporting their store management team and expecting the general and assistant managers to achieve goals with little to no help and no days off makes the job more stressful and overwhelming.
bad,"When I worked at Party City, the work was stressful but I believe it was due to poor management and poor communication. It was very fun an I learned a lot but I probably wouldn't go back."
bad,I never thought i would work somewhere where they had us hot glue products back together and sell them at full price right in front of our customers. Very un-professional and stressful
bad,I don't remember much about working here as it was such a long time ago but my managers were lovely and I enjoyed going to work everyday. Very laid back job perfect for my high school days.
bad,"The bozos at the main headquarters have no clue what they are doing. Sadly, they ask more production from four full time people and many part time students who could care less. The hours are always tight, no overtime. They expect more with less. Not for me."
bad,i was a stocker and cashier for $7.59 a hour. this was a seasonal job that would call me in on my off days so i enjoyed getting the overtime but it was only a seasonal job then they hired me on permanently.
bad,I worked at party city part time for the Halloween season a few years ago. I was harassed by and old man who had been saying inappropriate things throughout the days that i had worked. I did not enjoy my time working there as the store was filthy and extremely unorganized.
bad,This was my first job as a high school student. The management there was horrible and i would never recommend this job to anyone. The location i worked at was fairy racist.
bad,"I've learned that half of the time, you're on your own. sometimes, they're work with you and sometimes they don't. They don't make you feel like you're welcome and being treated fairly. they'll show you how to do half of the things you need to know about working with the company, and expect you to know the rest. it's been frustrating, because don't anybody wants to teamwork with you and only think about themselves. as a new things, instead of showing you what you did wrong, they'll belittle you."
bad,manager was rude and just not nice at all. be little you and di not train you correctly. did not take sales associates around store to show them around. it was kinda just teach yourself and figure out how things go alone
bad,"Not a lot was explained about how to accomplish daily duties. A lot of busy work was assigned as well as no set job titles. Manager was helpful though, and showed they cared."
bad,Working at Party City was a hard job. Working in retail anywhere is extremely hard. dedicate 85+ hours a week during peak times with little or no compensation. The people were great to work with.
bad,"It was nice to meet new people and help them out with their needs and the coworkers were great however the struggle with flashing colours and repeating songs would drive anyone insane. When you walk through the doors you are instantly bombarded with displays of different colours, balloons, different versions of party songs and the occasional popping of balloons. My favorite part of it was blowing up the balloons but not when they pop."
bad,"Working here was ok but it was seasonal. Management sucked on occasion because in order for me to talk to them, I had to come in because no one ever answered the phone.  Would ask me about 2 hours before when they want me to come in every day i was not scheduled to work."
bad,not dedicated to create an atmosphere for longevity. Lack of training. Rude assistant manager. She obviously felt she was better than others and when asked a question would roll her eyes and felt or perceived as put out of her way
bad,This is a fun place to work. I enjoyed helping customers. There was always something to do. I worked well with many of the coworkers and enjoyed team efforts.
bad,"I absolutely hated working there the managers were horribly mean and rude and disrespectful. WORST PLACE TO WORK AT, Party city is just a waste of time altogether"
bad,"this is the worst place to work, wont ever work for them again very unorganized and dirty place.  there's only a few hours you get to work and also a trash schedule"
bad,"The job is very easy to learn even if you don't have retail experience but too many promises are made in this job, and they never come through. very poor lack of communication with management, poor chemistry and morale, and they cut your hours without warning or notice."
bad,I was excited to start there in the beginning but realized how horrible management was there. There was barely any training provided except from the other employees who did work together as a team. ( for the most part)
bad,"Very High Demanding work Schedule, Job consists of wearing many hats, poor work life balance. They don't really take care of there employees. Stressful work enironment"
bad,Ive been with the company for one year and overall they are a great company but there is no advancement within the company. Management needs to improve.
bad,don't really have to much to say about party city the management there wasn't all that great but what I did like bout it was working with the customers and my team members
bad,Can be a fun place to work but it all depends on the staffing.  Busy times of the year is more fast paced and tends to be a bit more lively.
bad,"the location i worked at was horrible,management was rude and talked down to employees. employees and leads were okay."
bad,"My days were normally filled with balloon orders, cleaning, cashier, phones, customer service, and stock.I learned various positions within the store such as cashier, stock, and Halloween positions. The hardest part about this job was getting over my fear of ladders. the most enjoyable part was the customers and helping customers plan events."
bad,The job is demanding when it comes to seasonal positions. The Halloween season is the busiest and most time you don't have enough costumes for the customer or the staffing is low.
bad,A typical day was somewhat slow. Its more so a seasonal active job. Majority the most busiest during the Halloween season.
bad,NOT ENOUGH WORK HOURS. always busy good work environment good management amazing staff always hiring easy application process good training
bad,"hecktic meeting deadlines"
bad,"very relaxing day. but sometimes the managers slack off and let the employees do all the work. strict set of rules for the ones using the register, more calm to work on the main floor. unless its truck day and you get stuck doing solids."
bad,"Spent six years as part of the management team of a Party City store. Huge challenge in working with upper management, corporate and customer base. But the company did provide on-hands experience in team leadership and building and customer service,"
bad,Made several phone calls a day. Go to clients houses and display and demonstrate company product. Go through step by step what each tool does and how to use it. Make order forms. Attend once a week meetings. The co-workers were nice. The hardest part of the job was trying to get references from previous clients. The most . the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with people all day
bad,Extreme amount of hours for Management especially during Halloween.  Little room for advancement and no appreciation for all the hard work you do.
bad,Party city is fun to work at but they only pay minimum wage and never give you a raise. I worked at the cash register mostly and i had my cleaning duties as well. I learned how to be in charge and execute what needs to be done. Managers were nice and respectful except for one she was rude to employees and customers. My coworkers were all great and i got along with all of them. The job really wasnt to hard at all i had to manage my draw and make sure it was even every day and it was. Then i would have to clean a certain area and i had aisles i was in charge of organizing and cleaning. I enjoyed all the new people i met and all the different holiday decorations.
bad,"I love to use technology in order to setup household equiptment such as cable boxes, and universal remote controls, bluetooth, and solar powered engines. Plug-ins car stereo systems, electrical wiring for households and outer wiring such as city property.(lightpoles) for example."
bad,"The typical day is that I show up on time, they put me on a trailer and they take me to a strawberry field. I pick the strawberries and fill a box. I have to fill 8 boxes for an entire carton of strawberries. The managers are nice. The co-workers aren't very sociable. The hardest part of the job is / was is that it's BACKBREAKING WORK. ( literally ). The most enjoyable part of the position was that it is a great summer seasonal job."
bad,great place to work managers were fun people. i loved the kids that i seen with the costumes
bad,I worked here for the Halloween season and it was horrible I was always left alone having to clean the aisles and other stuff. My problem wasn't being left alone it was that the supervisors and manager would complain that i never interacted with other employees   and the reason behind that was because they always put me by myself so i had no one to talk to. When i worked the fitting rooms that was the only time i got to interact with other people other than tell/showing someone where something was. It seemed like I had more fun talking to the customers than with the employees because the employees didn't bother to talk to me other than when i was leaving and they would say bye that's about it.
bad,cool but wasn't the best job its great for somebody still in high school It was okay
bad,Party city is a good first job but it loses its allure after the first few months due to its strict policies and management.
bad,This was an somewhat  place to work for. This was an job for a younger person. Managerment was ok. Cow workers was nice. the hard time of the day was hours.
bad,"A typical day for my position involves exchanging goods for money, providing customer service, taking future orders, then cleaning. I learned how to operate a cash register and how to set shelves. Management has little experience and unsuitable traits to run a reputable store. The co-workers come in two varieties: calm and agreeable to be around or cliquish and complaining. Despite the large workload thrust upon you, the hardest part is interacting with the staff. My favorite duty is inflating mylar balloons."
bad,"I worked as a replenisher/cashier/receiver and was paid to do the cashier job as it made the least. They're a small business, so they cut corners where they can and unfortunately, they don't mind putting the pressure on the lowest of the totem pole."
bad,Days start slow with picking up around lunch and after dinner. Weekends are fast and hectic. Sales days are over all madness . A great place to learn one of the complicated cash registers. Management doesn't hassle you. Co-workers are friendly and helpful. Hardest part of the day is standing for 4 -7 hours.
bad,"No career advancement, culture and values of company is great."
bad,The staff is amazing but they make you do a lot for the little you get paid . They are very cheap and they have high expectations for no reason. Sometimes it can be fun but it really isn‚Äôt all that . The more they hire the less hours everyone gets
bad,Employment there was seasonal. I was only employed there for one month. While employed there I was not able to connect with management. Several other employees who were high school students as well were not satisfied with management. Poor communication.
bad,"Half of the managers there are rude and gossip and talk bad about employees and customers. You'll be considered one of the lucky ones if you don't get talked bad about. After the first week I wanted to leave. Not an enjoyable work space and really brings out the mundane, day to day life that no one wants but they have to do. Easy to get the job but its understandable because no one wants to stay there. Definitely would only consider this job just for the money which is only $8/per hour. They make you stand the entire time you're there and are always short staffed so if you need to leave because you're sick or anything it's almost impossible unless you have a decent manger working during your shift. They have you doing something all the time even though theres almost nothing to do so half the time you're there you have to pretend you're doing something or else you get yelled at. When it's cold, they don't even let you wear a jacket because it slightly covers up the $5 t-shirt they give you to wear there. During ""training"" they barely give you any, they expect that the other managers have already done it and get frustrated that they didn't already.  So you'll definitely have to be an independent, fast-learner and you'll have to figure out almost everything yourself. But if you're lucky enough, you'll get a quick run down of everything before they leave you to fend for yourself."
bad,"Company has forgotten the customer and is more focused on generating a few customer feedback reviews which are usually manufactured by the employees due to it being a metric in quantity. They burden the staff as a corporation with mostly work that doesn't benefit the customer but leads to less attention on the customer.  They design power hours of customer service when a particular store has little traffic rather than letting the individual store schedule to its business. District Manager have little leeway to make decisions that would improve a stores performance, the primary job is to check off a list that applies to every store with zero local feedback."
bad,Good place to work but not very technologically advanced. They have an excess of old inventory which clogs up the stores and labor is tight to manage it.
bad,Company has a sound business with a very Top down management process. Corporate managers rule the roost and there is very little room for interpretation a the field level. You do what your told.
bad,"In a typical day at work you will likely work on a cash register and help people with picking out costumes. The management is alright. There are several managers. Some are extremely picky, and some are very relaxed. The hardest part of the job (during Halloween) is dealing with customers, especially parents looking for costumes for their kids. They can be hectic."
bad,It is difficult working during Halloween hours because management can be very stressed and in turn make you very stressed. Not complaining but it is factual. There is a lot to do but that's a positive in my eyes.
bad,Went through like 5 different managers and multiple associates because everyone kept getting fired. The boss and main manager were dating and would change together in the open office. The boss seemed to really have it out for me as well. Every week I would get called out by managers and complimented on how hard I work but the boss would only breathe down my neck and insult me no matter what. I even had customers tell him themselves how much they appreciated my help but he still claimed I was lazy and never worked. His manager girlfriend made a deal to drive me home from a volunteer day of work and she wasn't there and literally ghosted me when i texted and called because I had no way of getting back home.
bad,"i got paid minimum wage at my party city and honestly i was ok with it in the beginning, but as the time went on, i became more resentful at that fact. i had to stand behind a register for like five to six hours, not allowed to move. because there was little activity in the store, it was a nightmare. plus my manager was the meanest person ever who made me cry on multiple occasions, so there‚Äôs that."
bad,"The employees are rude, the whole staff lacks communication. They‚Äôll change the schedule without informing you about it. During training I wasn‚Äôt taught certain things that I needed to know with working behind the cashier and I would get blamed for not knowing what I was doing from time to time and without helping me they‚Äôd talk about me as soon as I step away. Lacks hours, I can work 2-3 times within a whole month, no one  can make a living off that. They treat their employees like slaves with such little pay."
bad,"Party City is a busy place. At Party City you are a cashier, a stocker, a cleaner, and you work with customers. That is a normal basis. At Halloween it is crazy. It is long hours and you work way more than you think. Management is very nice and so are associates."
bad,"You better be good at tying balloons or don‚Äôt bother.  If you want more than 5 minutes to get good at it, then you should apply for another job.  Terrible communication and poor Managment."
bad,Management and coworkers are the best part of working here. But the pay is surprisingly low for such an expensive store and you only do about 8-15 hours a week. and usually they call me in even though its my day off and they have enough people to be working there. And the boss of my managers are only interested in making more money for themselves and making the store look clean.
bad,"The place was always in a mess . You only had a 15 minute break, so really a sitting break. Some people was always rude to you for no reason. And you hardly had any days off."
bad,"Party City was a fun productive place, got to see the cool costumes. Help the customers think about what they want to be, give them a imagination. Give them your advice about a customer or a toy for them to buy."
bad,"As a first job this was good, I was able to move up in Management in less than 2 years. I went from an Associate to Supervisor, then to a part time Manager and then Full time Manager at another store. This is when the problems started. This store overworked us and the new GM brought in his friend from his past store. The company managed the hours more than before and this made management running the store with no associates. This was a mega store yet was receiving the same amount of hours as smaller stores. This was a big error in the company's part. To keep everyone we were receiving only about 30 hours sometimes 23 hours a week as a full time position. I wouldn't be able to take breaks as a closing manager since all the other managers would come in at 4 am (I would do this as well multiple times) and leave around 1 or 2 when i got there. My breaking point was when i went in at 12PM to close until 9pm until we finished cleaning the store it was 10:30PM to go home and come in at 4 am the next day. This store was not right around the corner from my house. I decided to ask for a transfer since on top of not being able to get sleep it was far and tolls were killing me financially. I spoke to the DM after almost 2 weeks! We spoke about it and he ended up denying it stating after all my expenses i would still be making $40 more than the past store i was in. This was ridiculous, It was not like there were no other position openings because there was, I then spoke to HR and that was no help. He said he did not care what we wanted but instead he cared for what its better for the company."
bad,We mostly took balloon orders cleaned stocked and took customers at check out when we weren‚Äôt working register we would help customers who need help on the sales floor
bad,"I had a fun time working here for the Halloween holiday. I was only a part time seasonal employee, but from what I experienced it was about a 6 outta 10."
bad,"I mostly worked in the back pulling costumes for a number of people everyday, in a very cramped space. making sure costumes were the right size and not broken or stolen."
bad,"Working at Party City was probably the worst thing I could ever do, which stinks cause its ironically the longest I have worked anywhere. I would typically be working up front with the registers even though I was not a cashier. I would constantly do stuff that were outside my work lines to pick up the slack from other co-workers/managers. The morale of the store was very low with co-workers spreading rumors and lies about each other. Not to mention half the staff were under 18. Our boss was a bit of a slob, doing chewing tobacco and spitting it into water bottles, then leaving said bottles around the store. I could go on about how much I hate this work place, but this is pretty much the gist of it."
bad,its was fun at first. everyone was like family but now its stressful. magnagers are weird and you ether need to open a new store or hirer more people so some people dont have to work every day
bad,"The work wasn't difficult, and I have two complaints with working for this company. "
bad,The company is going through a period of change that has taken the operations of its stores away from its managers. GMs are currently glorified Supervising stockers. Little support of the GMs has taken a toll on moral.
bad,"Fun team members but the weekly hours given per store seldom matched the freight/workload.  Compared to other retailers, the normal team members hourly rate is minimum wage."
bad,"Associates and md level managers are fun to work with, but lately it seems as if upper management expects too much out of one person with little hours. We are not miracle workers. They want us to focus on customer service and get projects done but something has to give, and it is usally tasks assigned, then they get upset when they are not done."
bad,"need to be on your feet most of your day, a lot of hours are given if wanted. all day must communicate with customers and employees. management is always there to assist."
bad,The manager does not go by your availability. He would schedule you  on days you say you can not work. Be would be bias to certain coworkers than others.
bad,Working at Party City can be easy or hard. There is no clue as to what will be done each day and most of the time the management doesn't explain what needs to be done at the job.
bad,"Great for Jr. Level employees, high turnover for people with more experience."
bad,It is a high turn over company and I would not recommend it to anybody who is looking for stability. The hours are not good the pay is horrible. It‚Äôs good for someone looking for seasonal work or for something short term
bad,"Physical labour is no problem, but safety precautions were not taken seriously or regarded at all. The management was quite unorganized and most times communication was off. Complete training was not offered during the beginning of the job, and many aspects of the job was not introduced until later on. The only take-away was the gained retail experience and customer service experience. As for my co-workers, they were supportive and communicated well. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers."
bad,Store manager are required to work 47.5 hours min weekly. The company is going through a change to improve efficiency. Changing from a task oriented to a customer service company.
bad,"As disappointing as it sounds, I started and quit the same day. I was very excited when I got hired, but very disappointed when I started. Management was not prepared, people training me seemed like they didn't want to be bothered with me, the whole environment was unprofessional. 1 break the whole 8 hours I was there, so my feet were ON FIRE after my shift was over. Thank God a better opportunity called me while I was taking my break."
bad,"Not more you can expect from a retail job. Working the register, Halloween costumes. Cleaning, organizing, stocking, setting up displays, getting carts from outside."
bad,"Throughout the passed few years i've been at party city, blowing up balloons wasn't always easy. But I learned that being patient and practicing, I would get better. So i know that now with me working there, I am very quick with blowing up balloons. Customers come in and they want their orders to be done and ready to go. When it comes to a business like party city, everything you do has to be quick. Thats what the customers like."
bad,Outdated labor intensive policies coupled with diminishing labor hours are the hallmarks of near-sighted management and mark the beginning of the end for this retail dinosaur.
bad,this was a cool place to work but it had its ups and downs. The manager was nice but the superviser was bad. I love working with the manager. he was always easy to work with.
bad,"Depending on the location the general manager can be unorganized and unproductive. Relying mostly on their management team. "
bad,Working at Party City was fun for the halloween season but after that we lost a lot of people and management. It became frantic and stressful having to do jobs I was never trained for.
bad,"A typical day involves responding to emails, analzying sales, merchandising future sets, multiple meetings, reviewing projections, filllig out data forms, and briefing upper management on day-to-day business. Upper management often never on the same page which cases extra and unnecessar work for managers.At times decision made by upper management are not made based on the better good of all parties involved."
bad,"A typical day at Party City involved tasks such as manning the registers, unloading freight, stocking items, assisting customers with their questions and needs, filling customer balloon orders by creating balloon bouquets and greeting customers at the door. At this job I learned how to use a cash register, stock items and work quickly and efficiently in a fast paced environment. "
bad,I hated Party City. They treated me so badly because I was a intern and they didn't have to pay me. I was verbally abused by the manager almost every day and I dreaded going to that place.
bad,They are so disorganized its a real pain to get into it and as a minimum wage job I would not recommend party city. Its just not really an inviting environment.
bad,Working at Halloween City was different. Taking care of customers needs and wants with Halloween costumes and accessories. New shipments were always fun to get in too see what new products we got.
bad,"After ALOT of problems with the first general manager, we got a new one who shaped the store into tip top shape, but had no sympathy for her employees. Five months after my father passed i was told if i attended a family members funeral instead of going to work i would have to put my two weeks in or be let go because I had ""to much going on in my life""."
bad,Small company. trying to establish its self compared to competiors
bad,"A typical work day included stocking and down-stocking isles, cashing people out, recovering the store multiple times during the day, assisting customers with product, and advertising/recommending products to make sale goals at the end of each day. I learned better organizational skills. Management was just awful. My co-workers were down-to-earth and easy to get along with. We became one huge family and we always had each others backs. The hardest part was dealing with being belittled and patronized everyday by management. The easiest part of the job was the selling, stocking, and organizing."
bad,Small company and has potential to be better. Hard workers.
bad,this job has the moments and its fun but alot of work. the best is the benefits that the company gives you.
bad,As a seasonal worker i only had the opportunity to work there for a couple months. It had some of the nastiest managers and the work was over whelming. Managers were very rude and demanding. They treated their employers with such disrespect.
bad,Party city was a very boring workplace and I did not enjoy working there that much
bad,"I worked with a temporary crew that built the inside of the store."
bad,"come in open the store over see the stores operations, co workers where good, managers micro managed, hardest part was all the hours during Halloween, enjoyable part was Halloween, learned that you can be better"
bad,"Flexible schedule, Great to work with people, You can learn everything about the job in one day. Easy work and not very rewarding"
bad,There was a lot of unnecessary drama and talking behind workers backs especially by management talking about other workers in from of customers as well as employees. Not the most positive place to work at.
bad,"I really didn't like it at party city "
bad,"it was good to get customer service experience"
bad,"I was so excited to get on with this company. My supervisor did not train me properly, saying it was a busy time and he would get to it. He played favorites and was overly comfortable with a certain female employee. There was not near enough payroll hours to manage the store as it should be making it almost impossible to complete tasks."
bad,"If you do your job, you get lots of hours, but if not, you don't. Involves a lot of angry people and physical work, but if your coworkers are fun, it'll be an alright day."
bad,"El trabajar en esta empresa es algo tedioso por qu√©. L recibes el apoyo por parte de gerencia en todos los sentidos, es una empresa que no se presta para crecer , d√≥nde das y no recibes lo mismo d√≥nde hay una mala organizaci√≥n"
bad,"Party City was a good place to work at and it kept me very occupied, but during Halloween it is very busy. Party City was a fun place, although the management was not that good."
bad,"One of the worst decisions I've ever made in this lifetime was coming back here. Don't get me wrong, there are a handful of folks here whom I enjoy working with, but this place wants a million and 1 things done, with little to no time to do so. After awhile it takes a toll on your mental health, and I dread every shift that I have to work at this point. I'm currently looking for a way out. In the long run, it isn't worth it."
bad,"The people that i worked with were amazing and made the job worth it, but the upper management ran the store into the ground and made everyone quit. Including me unfortunately. There were absolutely no benefits to speak of, horrible pay, angry customers over out online store, and worst of all, I never got a raise for getting promoted to management. I was doing lots more stressful work, for the same amount of pay. (Just over minimum wage.)"
bad,The management in every store is different. This particular store needed to be revamped. The general manager knew what they were doing but the other management needs to go
bad,"Job it‚Äôs self is very hard work, non stop customer service, which depending on how you look at it is good but sometimes got chaotic. Overall fun place to work."
bad,"Party City was my first job, and at first I was seasonal, hired in October. The job was relatively easy, and about a month after I got let go they hired me back to be a part-time employee. Work was very simple but training was non existent."
bad,"Many employees seemed to not be able to adapt to the busy, hectic environment. Staff seemed to fool around, be favored by certain managers, and just not do their jobs. Cursing, inappropriate conversation, etc. were talked about in front of customers and out loud. Unpredictable hours and inequality in job performance by team members and treatment."
bad,"Honestly one of the most disorganized places to work. Even though there are some pros to working here, the people who run the store is ridiculous. Work is supposed to be a team effort, but here it‚Äôs not and there is no help from the other managers."
bad,"I worked at Party City for many years.  It is now time for a change."
bad,They don‚Äôt pay enough. The hours are not consistent. You only get 40hours when it‚Äôs hollowed time. After that your hours get cut to 2 days a week.not enough hours for someone who has a lot of responsibility
bad,"The culture of this company causes a lot of unnecessary stress. The store level management is good, but there is a decided lack of support from the corporation."
bad,"Management would hide in back and leave all the under trained, newer employees to handle customers in the front. This is a part-time job for high school students and/ or people that just need a part time job. For those of you who want to make money, I would suggest working at a good restaurant."
bad,"Had the job as a part-time/seasonal job. Worked well as a temp. job, but issues regarding management were immediately apparent. Staff members often got scolded in front of customers and other staff members. In some cases training was not sufficient. A good job to have if you are looking for a temporary work, but some changes are  needed for it to be an appropriate full-time job."
bad,There's not much you can say about retail. Its not a great job but you know that before going in.  I mean its retail there's not a whole lot to expect
bad,"Fun place to work great managers and great customers.However, since it's a small box retail store hours are tight and pay is little."
bad,Because owned by Party City you have no opportunity to advance.  This is a seasonal job.  Good people don't come here to work.  Managers don't have ways to keep good workers.  You come to work and are assigned an area to keep clean.  You do it or you don't no one seems to care until we close.  The employees are not knowledgable about the genres of costumes and have no skills in customer service.  Management is there from Party City and they really don't care about this part of their job just having fun.
bad,"a typical day at work would have me come in, punch in, and go to the grill station and start flipping patties. All my co-workers were not in my age group so we did not have a lot in common. Most of the managers were nice but their were a couple that were unnecessarily rude. Working at a fast food restaurant taught me how to move quickly and efficiently, in a fast paced situation, as well as how to work together as a team."
bad,"The management I worked under while at Party City was never good for the entire time I was there. The general manager was changed 5 times during the 1 year I was there. The way in which they managed was very condescending and poorly done. Often times employees were threatened with termination if they did not comply with a schedule or did certain jobs, even if they put it in their availability. The management was very inconsiderate of employees lives outside of the job and all in all weren't the type of management they should have been. During a month after I took my leave from Party City I learned that 5 other employees also left the company."
bad,"Busy filling baloons, cleaning constantly, dealing with cash and customers, having to work under unsafe conditions. I have learned to  a lot from this company over the three years that I worked here. Management was great the corporate world was the hardest part of the job. The company made the store under unsafe procedures and did not allow enough hours for a functional high merchandising store such as this store. Co workers were friendly and funny. The hardest part about the job was no employee compensation and lack of rules set place for building moral by the corporate departments. Making angry customers happy was my favorite part."
bad,Productive place to work but at the same time was laid back. Management was decent. No room for advancement or raises. Seasonal job.
bad,Party City is a private company that does not offer a lot of room to grow and does not provide necessary benefits to make a decent living. Management is unprofessional with employees and often uses inappropriate language.
bad,"There is a lot expected of you for low pay. I was given a ""promotion"" with no raise. Management does not seem to care about the employees, they just expect more than is possible to complete in a shift. Human resources does not respond to complaints. Could be a fun work environment with better management and better pay."
bad,"I wish all the promises of full time hours with benefits were a reality. I love the people I currently work with, however.....new management brought in across the province are bringing in their own friends and previous employees and shafting everyone else that has been dedicated to making the place tick. "
bad,"This is a typical retail experience. There are no benefits, except for the management. Advancement is bleak if any. The only part that makes this worth anything is the people I work with, They have become some of my best friends and for that reason alone I have stayed here. The pay is minimum wage with no bonus."
bad,"A typical day of work consisted of ringing on the cash register, inflating balloons, assisting customers. I learned customer service skills, responsibility, handling money, and problem solving. The management was lazy and not well planned out. The culture was fun overall and i enjoyed my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was trying to do everything with only one or two other employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to talk to customers."
bad,Many task related responsibilities eat up most of your time.  Adequate hours for achieving task related deadlines were not given.  Helium shortage was very difficult to manage.
bad,"The job is very slow paced up until Halloween, even though everything is done you must look busy. When new you have to do all the dirty work clean bathrooms etc;"
bad,Way too stressful for the pay. It was decent for a seasonal job whilst looking for another job. Co workers are just bratty teenagers who will do what they want.
bad,its retail. There was nothing complicated and definitely nothing certain. I was informed of my last day on my last day while others were given prior notice.
bad,"Long overnight shifts were the worse, the job was actually terrible all and all but the overnight manager Aaron was super cool and motivational and made it all worth it. I remembered working 24 hour shifts with him and he would give me countless number of reasons why not to quit."
bad,"Although I only worked there for about a month and a half, I can say that I did not enjoy my experience. The management doesn't do anything and my fellow co-workers never actually did their jobs because no one was enforcing the rules."
bad,"Not getting paid for what your worth."
bad,"Help customers find costumes or put items away"
bad,"There are many different ways to start the morning depending on the day at Party City. Some mornings you need to process a shipment of freight, and afterwords pack it out. Other days you need to process the morning paperwork or count the drawers/safe. Besides that most of the day was helping customers, ringing at the register, blowing up balloons, or cleaning the store. The hardest part of the job was not having a lot of time to do the work that was required, as well as not having enough store hours to schedule assistance if necessary."
bad,"It was nice for the little bit of extra cash, but a lot of people never showed up or didn't actually do their jobs. I picked up a lot of extra shifts and was 1 of 3 people not including our managers that came in the week (roughly) that it took for us to pack out the store at the end of the season. After all that I also got screwed out of half my pay due to ignored technical issues, no matter what I did I couldn't get answers from corporate. I was 17 so I was doing the best I could with a bad situation."
bad,In my opinion it‚Äôs a good work place but management isn‚Äôt good. It‚Äôs a fun environment. You‚Äôll meet a tons of people. Halloween is always the busiest!
bad,"Halloween City was an incredibly easy seasonal job. Very little was required of each employee on a daily basis. The in-store management was outstanding, including the often-visiting regional manager, but the communication between the store and higher-ups was near non-existent. There was a serious lack of information and support being given to the store and in-store managers at times of need,"
bad,"Many of the pop up stores, mine included, were placed in less than  optimal locations. Mine had exposed wires, no fire alarm, no co2 alarm no safety what so ever. We only had 1 working outlet which we needed a 200ft extension cord to run across the store to power the registers."
bad,"I was recently laid off due to company restructuring. One of the factors was because I was overpaid for my position (which I knew). The salaried GM's have an overwhelming workload, which is going to get even worse due to a lack of experienced managers to support them. It is very fast paced, and there are constant seasonal conversions and planogram revisions."
bad,"A typical day at work is like every other retail, it's employees do their required jobs without delay and assist consumers. "
bad,A typical day included helping customers. The management is great. I learned a lot of things when it comes to running a store and the best way to operate to get things done. The most enjoyable thing about the job are the co-workers.
bad,"it has very poor management. It was always a mess and the employees did as they pleased. Besides that, the company was hard to deal with and the training was unprofessional"
bad,Working at party city made me become very flexible work wise and taught me that working hard pays off. Working here helped mold me into the hard working woman I today.
bad,"I worked at party city for two weeks and quit after my second week. All but two of the mangers are rude and seem to always have attitudes! I couldn't deal with it any longer, so I just decided to quit. If you're going to be a manager, at least have a positive attitude and don't be rude to your employees because of something they have no control over or didn't do!"
bad,"Fun and productive environment.  I learned to stock merchandise up top, and bring top stock down, in addition to learning to assisting with the balloon orders."
bad,"As soon as you walk through the door you walk to the back room put your bag and other belongings on a hook or drape it around the room, then you would go to the office put your phone in a basket and grab a walkie-talkie, if you were a cashier you would count a drawer and you would go to the front and start work. There will be days where you don't get a lunch break because of miscommunication or lack of communication. When you do go on lunch break, you might not be able to get your cellphone from the office. Our break room was the storage room. We didn't even have a table 95% of the time. We would get in trouble ALOT for things we didn't do or had any control in. So many people quit that job when I was working there due to unfair treatment and the way management was treating us. The management were so unprofessional that you might even get cursed at or spoken too in a harassment sort of way."
bad,"I love halloween"
bad,"The hardest part of the job , I didn't get a break everyday. It was real bad management . It was some cool co-workers. A typical day , I will stock items and help customers . I had plenty times as a cashier as well ."
bad,"I have worked at Party City for a short time.  It was a fun experience and the environment was pretty upbeat. Communication by management was pretty good due to the daily morning meetings they have, but management micromanaged on the hours to the T.  You would get a manager talking to you, even if you punch out a minute late of the end of your shift."
bad,Forget every having any holiday off and planning on living at work for Halloween.  Very task driven company with no payroll to compensate.  Leaves no time to focus on customer and sales.  Store Management makes up for lack of payroll to support task.  Becoming a micromanagement company in every detail.
bad,Company has been big over ratio when it comes to management. The store staff is awesome.
bad,"Opened and Closed the Store. Provided service to customers by finding the right product to fit their needs. Maintained aisle integrity by making new price labels, fixing empty spots with other related product, and much more. I've learning that the training from the top doesn't come fast, or like I like to train my associates. The hardest part was keeping up with the constant seasonal change of product, and the pricing. The most enjoyable part was being able to train a staff and watch them improve, and most importantly take care of the customers"
bad,Good job for those teens trying to start making money. They always worked with my school schedule and the people I worked with were all pretty cool except for one Manager who would play with our hours and paychecks.
bad,"very dull place to work, feel as if the workers there are all dreading the place, although its a very easy job, it feels very miserable to everyone around but it was bearable i had fun meeting some new coworkers"
bad,"This was my first real job and was my most temporary. I was a sales associate which required working the register at times, assisting customers and stocking the store. It was sort of a boring yet simple position in which the only time I would have some variety is when helping customers with costume ideas."
bad,I personally hated this job. I just didn't like the environment and I just was always stressed out going there. The employees were quite clicky and rude to me
bad,"It was seasonal work, but very enjoyable. The staff worked as a team. I loved interacting with all customers. The work schedule was very unpredictable. We did receive a 30 percent discount and on Halloween,  the staff wore costumes. We always greeted each customer as they entered."
bad,"The start of your day would be stocking the front and making sure the store looked clean before being open. The Cashier would make sure the front be ready and be doing balloon orders, while the floor associate would either stock items in the aisle or doing what was needed to be done, such as rearranging a section of the store."
bad,Told me my job was seasonal but then laid me off :) so that was great. Also tried to make me stay late to clean the entire store when (I'm a minor) I was the only one cleaning at the time that everyone else should have been doing the same so we could get out on time
bad,Everyday would be a difficult day to bare with due to lots of customers to satisfy with low staff. Very cool co-workers. Halloween season is the worst. Loved how we get free lunch on the weekends in October for the whole month and loved that paycheck when it came in! Every saturday is doom day because it's so busy. Especially in the morning with all the balloon orders. Manager was not flexible with my hours because i was going to school. This one time I went a whole week without working and i was clueless as to why he did that...
bad,Working for this company was nothing short of an adventure. throughout my time there I was given many different jobs and was tossed back and forth.. there was no problem with this minus the communication while one manager told me to go here and another would tell me to go somewhere else and in between me running back and forth trying to satisfy both customer and manager ; I would end up getting an attitude for doing my job. not the worst but not a place I would work again
bad,"They need more hours, the only good time to work is Halloween, other then that it sucks. 5 hours a week is something i cannot live off, if i had at least 3 days a week id be okay."
bad,"It's well under staffed, long days for not enough pay. Alot of people have left for five below because of how unstable the environment is. Just not a fun place to work"
bad,"PROS: Easy to get promoted. Decent benefits. Very accommodating when needing a day off. You could dress up for holidays/big sporting events."
bad,"While working at Party City you have seasons change very quickly because there is always a new season or holiday approaching. A typical day at work you clock in and go to your post. I was mainly a stocker so I would take freight from the back and stock the shelves while also interacting and helping customers. I learned a lot of how the process works for when they transition from one holiday to another, how a lot of it is reused product, how they over-order product for when a certain holiday comes around like Christmas and New Years. Aside from that I learned how to do balloon orders, run the register, and how the Halloween season works. "
bad,"Great first job. A fun , upbeat place to work. This is a very hands on job and a great place to work and have a great time everyday. a great place to work where you can interact with children and customers."
bad,"Everyday was an interesting and eventfull day, lots of work and orders with balloons, everything is can be fast pace or slow depending on the day. My co-workers were great and helpful to work with as well.Never any problems."
bad,"Party City is a fun productive job,the most enjoyable part of working with the company was with the customers in helping them choose a character for what they wanted to be dressed up in Halloween"
bad,"party city was a fun part time job, but it became tedious and awful when the switch was made to full-time. The district manager was so miserable she brought the whole store down during her weekly visit. Opinions would be made of associates and no matter how hard they worked they could never shed poor impressions. The hardest part of the job was dealing with all the negativity surrounding performance. The workload was easier than most retail stores but the awful pay and poor raises bring this company down ever further."
bad,"i wouldnt recommend making this a career for this compnay, they are pretty small as is and the job really wouldnt be good for a career unless you were management"
bad,Sales is most important. Protecting the merchandise because it is often stolen is also important on the job. Plenty of merchandising will be done because items are always misplaced throughout the store.
bad,I was only working here seasonally. Was fun during Halloween time. Get to see all the decorations and the people all excited for their costumes. wasn't here long enough to know more about it.
bad,"It‚Äôs an entry level retail job. Nothing special about it. If you are in school and need a minimum wage job, this could be the job that that fits your needs"
bad,Days when my manager act like he didn‚Äôt like no one at work and everyone was out to get him. Then there was days he loved everyone and work was great but I enjoyed the time I spent there.
bad,"I hated party city. I gave them a plus because that was my first ever job. I only liked 1 manager, everyone else got on my nerves and I couldn‚Äôt stand them. One of my managers were was racist and I was over them."
bad,"General managers and oihers ""on top"" did not help our store as much as they should have--there was no direction given by them. This was a seasonal job,"
bad,"There were five on the stock crew. When management decided to keep people they pick 3 out of 5. I wasn't one of them and the funny thing was is that I would've been the only one that has a vena clean background and would've passed a drug test. I figured it was their loss, I was the one that was there before everyone else and the last one to leave."
bad,A good first job for anyone in high school. They are flexible with hours and will even offer you more hours during the seasonal time if you need it. friendly and caring
bad,They will hire someone else to replace you in a heartbeat. All they want is you to get emails from customers and if you‚Äôre below 35% you‚Äôll get fired. Too much stress for a part time job. Maybe ok for a high school student.
bad,"The worst part of the job was when it was slow, which was most of the time. Except for halloween. The best part of the job was creating balloon bouquets."
bad,"good job to have while you're in high school or even straight after high school. you'll learn how to handle cash, customer service, and how to work with others."
bad,"Most of my coworkers were awesome but the managers all seemed to hate their jobs. One took it out on me by calling me stupid once a shift for not knowing how to work the IBM computers for the register. The cashiers like me were nice and one manager made it bearable. The customers treated the cashiers like poorly, especially in the morning with balloon orders. There were a lot of inconsistencies in training and I only lasted 2 months. I would have gritted my teeth through the impossible to satisfy customers if the management wasn't so mentally unstable."
bad,"The job was easy; you work with customers and do what's listed in the job description. You make sure things are nice and neat, with a little bit of sweeping here and there, before going to greet customers and helping them with whatever they need. However, I have some reasons to believe a majority of my coworkers were mentally unstable. So, good job, but their interview filtering obviously isn't in place when they accept about anyone."
bad,"Was just not the job for me to be honest, but I tried to work with it but it got worse from there on. Hours got cut back. Sometimes only working 10 hours a week."
bad,"The Store Manager in the store did not have a clue to how to treat her staff. Everything had to be  done her way and anything her staff would do to make things better, she would take the credit for everything."
bad,"The workplace was horrible, staff was always low. One worker had to do 4 jobs at once. customers would be upset due to the lack of workers. hours were inconsistent. I'm glad i left when i did."
bad,Don't let the name fool you. This place was not a party to work. I dreaded coming into work every time I was scheduled. The managers don't communicate well with each other and confuse their employees. no team skills at all with the management team.
bad,"I'd walk in and clock in and since this was a seasonal job, I mainly maintained the fitting room. Management was very chill about everything and never caused my time working there stressful. Loved seeing all the costumes and props that were available."
bad,"I learned a lot about how to treat the customers, but I was constantly being criticized and bombarded by my manager. Also the store was very messy and dis-functional which made it hard to complete my daily tasks. I enjoyed talking to the customers and helping them with what they needed to find. My colleagues were very friendly and always got to work as soon as possible but they constantly argue with the manager."
bad,There is nothing wrong with working in Party City. The coworkers are nice and reliable people to work with. The down side is you don't have many work days. You are limited to very few days to work. They are unable to keep most of their in store employees after Halloween season.
bad,"Love Holidays. I started because of Halloween and got comfortable. I loved when new holidays would roll in, but it makes them go by so fast. Honestly if it weren't for the people I worked with, I would have left a while ago. The company honestly doesn't care about its employee's."
bad,"Management was horrible, with a horrible attitude. Inconsistent hours due to fluctuating business. Weekends were the busiest, but were also enjoyable because of how quick your shift went."
bad,"It was terrible working there, Management was cool, aside for one of them, it had its ups and its downs. The other employees were nice they did their jobs well."
bad,This is a fast working environment with low productivity. I always seen customers waiting for their food and other workers taking time and having their own conversations while working rather to get customers orders.
bad,surrounded by candy and party supplies all day can be enjoyable. lots of prep before store opens and when store closes. Sometimes will cut hours with 24 hours notice.
bad,When I first started working there I would only work with one person so it was really boring and then a lot of the customers did not want my help and I thought it was because I am Hispanic and most of the customers were white. I didn't really learn much. The manager was never there when I worked and if she was I would never see her. The work place was okay. Hardest part was collecting the signs and flags from outside from outside when it was really dark.
bad,"go in you are either cashier or your gunna clean and stock product. or you will replanogram. you get your break few hours in if you are under 18 your break will be after first 3 hours."
bad,"Managers weren't that nice or friendly. If you had a task, they wouldn't tell you exactly what to do.. You'll have to do it on your own. Customers can be a bit mean."
bad,"i was never treated equally and i felt like everyone's work monkey for stuff they didn't want to do. and when i actually left, it was because i called in on a medical emergency and they fired me for it, then tried to call me in the next morning, so no, i don't recommend working here."
bad,i loved being in a party store but the pay and the way they treat you while working there isn't worth it to be honest its sad to see actually cause its a beautiful place but to many rude people that work there hands down
bad,"A typical day would include working the csh register, fulfilling balloon orders, and making sure all of the items are visible for the customers to see."
bad,The only thing I remember about Party City was that the 40-50 year old employees had the same position an pay that I did as a 16 year old. Customers were often rude.
bad,Party City is a fun place to work but not challenging and tedious. The store i work for is a franchise and the owners are great but the management does not delegate responsibility to the associates very well.
bad,-Not a good company to work for. Hard to be kept busy. Very boring and gets a little busy during holiday season. The work is extremely redundant and not very productive.
bad,"Our manager was replaced by someone who has no idea what he is doing and we ended up behind on stock because he refuses to work with the system that we had that was more efficient. Instead opting to favor the ""corperate"" way."
bad,"what your  company does in terms of providing fantastic health care service for B.C residents.Therefore , I would like to have the opportunity to do Co-op in your company as an Automation tester and get involved in coding and testing software in order to assist the test team in scripting and executing test cases."
bad,"Working with Party City for almost six years; the job was enjoyable at first. I had to move around to different locations a lot that would be   miles away from home with no drive pay or milage. The pay wasn't what I would have hoped for from being a part of management with the company for almost three years. With it being a seasonal based type of work place, i could never actually enjoy the Holidays."
bad,A job meant for kids in high school. Nice coworkers fun work environment. Had lots of fun during the Halloween season. Would not work here again.
bad,Party City was flexible with my work schedule. I worked with a strong team that was able to get our daily tasks completed with ease. I enjoyed working with a fun team.
bad,"Very part-time. Not something to make a career out of unless you are a store manger or above, but it is very slow pace ad very easy to catch on to work. Mangers are required for everything which can cause check outs to take long."
bad,"Party City was really busy during Halloween time but once Holiday season was over it was really slow and they started cutting back hours. I learned how to use the register and how to top and down stock. My managers were really cool, they were always really helpful when I needed them. I had the best group of co-workers. They were all amazing, I got a long with all of them and whenever I needed help they would be there for me as well. The hardest part of the job was definitely down stocking. The most enjoyable part of the job was doing balloons and being able to hang around with co-workers."
bad,"The experience was just that, an experience! Company on the lower end of management was great until you went higher up and they didn't any longer care or praise you for the work you have done or how you give 110% to only get 5% back!"
bad,"mostly responsible for keepin the store clean and the floors clear , leveling shelves when low on products,greeting customers an helping them find they are looking for"
bad,"While working here there were a lot of rushes, difficult customers, and short breaks. Hours were not very flexible. A typical day working for this company included cleaning and restocking as well as helping customers. The maintenance of the aisle's was the most difficult part because of all the small objects that were sold. Co-workers were very kind and understanding."
bad,"Party City was a fun place to work, but it seemed to be a bit unprofessional. Such as, the managers had their favorites towards the employees and it was clearly showed."
bad,"Very busy during the peak season in October for Halloween. Very slow for the rest of the year. Some christmas traffic, not much. Store went out of business."
bad,"A typical day was usually running the register, cleaning the sales floor, and making sure all merchandise was displayed neatly and put back in it's proper place. I learned many things like how to run a register, create and fill balloon orders. Improve my people skills. Management wasn't that great. They abused their power and HR wasn't much help either. However, the best part of the job was being able to help customers with their party planning and helping them find what they needed."
bad,"A typical day at work for me at Party City was either ringing up customers at the cash register or taking care of all the balloon orders. "
bad,This was a very fun place to work but I did not see any room for growth.
bad,"On a daily basis I would travel from store to store to conduct store visits/audits or simple pop-in visit. I spend a lot of time training and developing General Managers but was in communication with all members of management. "
bad,The job itself is very awesome but to put up with immature coworkers made the job even harder
bad,Expected me to do too much for how much I was being paid. Required some heavy lifting
bad,helping customers  with costumes an party favors making balloons for customers an taking there orders
bad,"Party city was a change from anything else I had done, it was a nice change until the hours got cut for everyone,"
bad,pretty much the guy who ran the place did not know what he was doing.
bad,"how to work a cashier"
bad,"i clock in, then i go straight to the back and get my walky talky and raido in with my partner. i check and see what job she/he constomer servers or stock and depending on what they say my job would be the opposite. at closeing we all participate in recovering the store."
bad,"Party City is a fun workplace and serious. To work at a party store you need to have an outgoing personality, and really know how to communicate with customers."
bad,I only worked there for seasonal so i dont really have much to say about the company
bad,"The store that I worked at was a new store so, it had some improving to do. The general manager there was lazy and didn't like to do his job. They would make me work crazy hours some days and other days barley any hours. I was full time and they would give you part time hours."
bad,"I had to put in my two week's without a job lined up because I was seriously concerned about getting so fed up at work that I'd walk out of the store and never come back. There's absolutely no incentive to work there, especially considering the fact that I worked my tail off in that place and still couldn't pay rent. It's just not worth it if you're trying to find a job where you want to stick it out for the long haul."
bad,"Halloween City was not a job that you could make a career out of. This was a temporary store set up for only two months for the holliday of Halloween. A very short lived job,but gave me some very good experience in a fast paced very buisy atmosphere. I enjoy Halloween already, So being given the opertunity to work for a sister company of Party City was truly a fun job."
bad,"This job had it's pro's and cons but mostly cons. Constantly changing design and layout for one. overall the customer base who visit the store are needy and can be very rude. Disorganized system for handling customer balloon orders and no system in place to find online orders. No advancement opportunities for a while. Management, when I was there, worked extremely long hours and made reps do the same. Once I worked from 12 p.m. Saturday to 4 a.m. Sunday. I worked multiple shifts like that. On top of that, the store was understaffed and although we were told they were hiring no new faces came through. Overall it was a messy experience but the work culture overall was pretty good. The reps were all very cool and understanding people."
bad,"The management was terrible and the general manager had a bad attitude, barely get breaks, shortly staffed, you can‚Äôt leave until someone comes to cover where you are."
bad,"Great management. They just can't provide enough hours for someone to feed their family. I would say it's a great part time job, but it's not because of the minimum wage"
bad,"At Party City many employees and especially managers feel overworked and unrewarded. This is typically a fast-paced environment with lots to do, and while managers and coworkers themselves were friendly and welcoming, overall everyone felt tired from the amount of work being put in on a daily basis, but were not enthused to come to work the following day as the amount of hard work did not feel rewarded appropriately."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of this job is helping customers find that costume they wanted to celebrate Halloween. Especially, when you helped the kids because they get so excited!"
bad,"It was fast paced while working for the Party City located in Maple Grove, MN. I like fast paced because it keeps my mind and myself busy. However, training was horrible -- literally  had no one to train me and I just had to learn on my own from watching and asking questions as I started working there. They forgot to give me a lunch break a few times and I had to go ask them for one because I got hungry. Management was horrible too. I got yelled at something I didn't do (got an apology after learning the real situation, but yelling isn't professional either way). This was the worst job experience and company that I ever worked for until this day!"
bad,"Good place to work flexible hours"
bad,I some what enjoyed working there i got along pretty much with all my coworkers and some of the managers cant say everyone. Not very organized when it come to Halloween season only worked there cause i really needed the money.
bad,Party city is a place for high school kids to work not much so if your an adult looking to make money. If your not a manager you would make little to nothing the scheduling is horrible but it is a fun place to work.
bad,I didn't like my co workers we weren't able to count our register before or after we left. there was always more then one person to a register
bad,"busines"
bad,This is a really good beginners job.
good,"My experience at Party City was included through a seasonal job as a cashier. "
good,"Flexible hours, calm. Very low pay but if you are recently starting to build your own job history its a good start. I don't like how party city has more preference with some employees and it makes the environment tense because you feel left out of the team."
good,"Hated working there but it was a job. When I was hired I was told average hours would be 45 to 50 hours a week, was more like 60 plus. Liked working with the kids and the manager and the customers. Management not so much"
good,"Party City is a very busy place. During the holidays, it is the most busiest time of the year becasue people are preparing for the holidays. The hardest part was finding the hallaowwen costumes for the parents an letting the back know the size and code for each costume and restocking the shelves. I was on my feet 8-10 hours a day and wen I got off my feet were in pain."
good,"I mostly enjoyed working for this company, however it was just a seasonal position, so I wasn't there very long. Some of the employees were rude and unhelpful at times, and even to the customers as well."
good,"I learned how to planogram, and do inventory. coworkers were very helpful with everything that I needed to learn. Management was very selfish and didnt care too much about keeping their customers and employees happy."
good,"Do not work here for anything other than Halloween. The rest of the year you're lucky to see a single paycheck in two months. "
good,Working for party city had its ups and downs. Its ups were that I worked with great people except Two. Its downs was that I would work overtime and would only get paid for 1.5 hours of overtime
good,"Applied for part time and they told me that ""we don't offer part time for legal adults."" Had me on 54 hours one week. That's more than my mom and she works on Wall Street. "
good,"It was okay to work there "
good,"a typical day at work consisted of stocking, answering phones, ordering and cleaning. I learned great customer service, merchandising skills. the hardest part of the job and most enjoyable parts of the job were getting ready for the holidays"
good,"Nice people"
good,I really never had a problem with partycity up until the time that I left there was a lot of he-said-she-said kind of stuff I felt like the manager isn't really a full-on caring manager I really love my job there I was very disappointed when I had to leave overall and if it would be under different management I probably wouldn't mind going back.
good,This company is known for being oriented mostly on stocking shelves and pushing merchandise. If you read any review of party city you will hear about boxes piled high in the isles and some parts of stores being completely inaccessible to customers. This is because the company only stocks during open business hours. So every employee is busy stocking shelves with their faces to a wall and never engaging customers. This is a universal review across all party cities if you look into it. So if you thrive in chaos and designed inefficiency then Party City is for you. If you want to use your customer service and sales skills I would recommend a diferent retail chain.
good,Employment at Party City from Aug-Nov is not long term. If you are a teen and want a temporary part time job this is for you. Management was horrible while I worked there.
good,"party city is a place where you and your co workers and always working together, helping each other and it could be a bit nice for people who enjoy helping people."
good,"Some managers were nicer than others, the environment was very stressful. The manager would yell at employees in front of customers, you were criticized instead of being motivated."
good,Managment is poor the people who work there are not reliable the store is not kept well nor do they care about it people are rude and inconsiderate as well
good,don't like party city because they wasn't organized in their store you can barely find merchandise at all. the enjoying part about the job is wearing my Halloween costumes and the hardest part about the job is working in a not so cleaned environment. I learned how to work the cashier register. a typical day at work is seeing my old friends work there.
good,"store manager,had staff of 30,handled all hr for store, scheduling, inventory control,had great asst mangers, great staff, lots of fun but owners were ridiculous, i learned a lot of plumbing and maintenance skills with this job"
good,I am 17 years old and from the time i started the job i was nothing but disrespected by some of the managers above me. i was given a 35 cent raise while all my coworkers were stuck at minimum wage and they eventually were let known of my raise and continuously harassed me. i left due to the fact that my managers wouldn't let me take a week off due to a school trip.
good,I would walk into work clock in get my name tag and headset then walk into the office to count my drawer. Then we would walk up front and I would sign into the register that I would be using for the rest of the night and start helping customers check out when they were all done with everything. I would also greet the customers when no one was in line and ready to get checked out. I learned how to take balloon orders and how to get a balloon order ready for pick up day. Management was alright they did what they needed to do but they were not really friendly with new workers. The hardest part was standing around when there was no one int he store or ready to check out because I wasn't allowed to leave my register. I loved watching all the little kids coming in with there parents and seeing how much stuff we have to do party stuff.
good,I got to work usually was in the stockroom or floor helping costumer with anything they needed. the management was ok they where their watching the floor. I always communicate good with my coworkers. The most enjoyable moment was the face to face with the costumer.
good,"A typical day was not too busy and not too slow, helping customers was very easy. I learned how to talk to customers and how to sell them certain merchandise. My coworkers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was selling the ""big"" items. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and just being there to be helpful."
good,I would have loved to stay on there to work. If they were able to work around my family life as well as having good team members for me to work with. I liked been able to stand alone to get some of my jobs done an they know they could count on me.
good,Maneger doesnt really know what she was doing
good,Party City is a good place to work but the manager was not that much professional.
good,"it was very short i wish it was longer, meet new people that i never thought we would be friends"
good,My job was only fun due to the few great people I worked with. Other than that other people were unprofessional and the place was full of clicks. Many people stole from other peoples lockers while on the job. Management never did a thing about it.
good,Typical day is openng by cleaning the doors and windows. Cleaning off all cash registers and table tops. checking customers out at the register and helping them blow up ballons. Lastly if closing sweep the e ntire store and straighten up the store then leave.
good,"It was okay, one manager wasnt the nicest and there was another that was SO nice loved her. But it was a temporary job wasnt much too it but everyone else was nice and helpful. Easy job"
good,"Was a fun environment to work for. I hated the balloon counter, if you like working with younger employees, this is the place. Halloween is the craziest time most I've made during Halloween and hours was 90 but my pay check was maybe 900.. after taxes..."
good,A manager was highly racist and made my job hard to complete. I did love what my job was but I was often tasked with things not in my job description like instead of the manager dealing with frustrated customers I had to
good,"The manager was strict, and intimidating. I usually worked alone or with one other person in the mornings. The store was always dead on weekdays, which made for a very long and boring shift. Weekend were always packed. With people picking up last minute items, or their balloon orders it became very stressful. There was literally no in-between. Slammed, or dead. They also had a no tattoo policy, which I remember very well bc one of my coworkers had to wear a long sleeve shirt every single day to cover is fully tattooed arms. Aside from being totally bored, I think it was fun to blow up balloons on occasion."
good,"As a customer you enter the store excited to shop for your special event. However, you will leave frustrated and unhappy. The stores themselves are typically very dirty and disorganized. The employees are not knowledgeable about current sales or promotions. They treat customers as a burden when asked for assistance. They are continually out of stock on several items. Getting to the item you want to purchase is an obstacle course since there are typically boxes stacked everywhere. If you think that's bad, turn the table and try being an employee. The employees are paid well below comparable jobs. Training is next to non existent, you are placed in front of a computer for one day then are put onto the sales floor behind a register. The lower level management team are never available to help due to being loaded down with unnecessary projects. The upper management team is completely unaware of realistic goals and daily work routines. There are no incentives for anyone to perform at a high standard. The best thing this company could do is close down permanently and save the customers and employees time and money."
good,"Employed while in high school during Halloween, Christmas, etc. for two years, part time.  Supervisors also high school employees. During a particular holiday, extremely busy supplying the customers."
good,It was an ok place to work the manager I had to work with was worthless though I can‚Äôt really think of anything else to say about the place Im really just trying to fill up the paragraph
good,"The only part of this job that i liked was how easy the register was. the pay was bad, my manager at the time was horrible. the interview was weird. would not really recommend working here. i absolutely hated taking and making balloon orders."
good,"Working at Party City is not all sprinkles and rainbows. The best part of the job is making children happy when there birthday balloons are given to them and seeing the smile on their face. Most of the time I am not able to enjoy my job because I have about a hundred tasks to do and only get 4 hours to get them done. I am the only sales associate during my shift, other than a manager in the backroom. I sometimes have to blow up balloons, be on the sales floor and cashier all at the same time. Most days this would be fine but our store is inside of a mall and our store gets bum bared with teenagers throwing stuff down the isles and wrecking the place.Other than that its a alright place to work."
good,It wasn‚Äôt a bad job. It also wasn‚Äôt a perferred job. It‚Äôs only busy during the holloween season so unless you plan only just working there for a short period of time I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it.
good,Great opportunity for a student . Entry level retail job. Can be fun yet hectic during Halloween time . Overall its a happy place to work at. Pro - employee discounts for costumes.
good,"Party City is slow paced "
good,"I learned a lot while working there and developed a great team. However, I feel that it could have been managed much better and feedback was almost non-existent."
good,The managers there are no good they don‚Äôt care about the workers. All the managers do isnsit around up front by the registers and talk closer to the end of the night and they do not help to clean up
good,"customer service, sell party supplies. Help customers on what they need to offer a good a party."
good,I didn't like the management. They look down on you if you are just a seasonal. They don't warn you ahead of time if they are going to keep you or not. very unprofessional.
good,"Use to deal with customers who were looking into having parties, events, birthdays and during October; the major Halloween costume seasons"
good,I was only hired for the season only but the time I did work it was an ok experience. They could have worked more on their organization. The co-workers were nice and they worked together to do their job. The pay was not great.
good,"I have no review comments to make."
good,"You get to help a lot of people with your creativity ,  helping to plan partys and showing them the things they will need and the things they really don't need,  Giving creative Ideas, care for your customers"
good,"My typical day at work would depend on what I have to do for the day"
good,"for what they paid here I did a lot. answered phones, questions, was a cashier, supposed to know the layout, and if I was a really good worker all of the items in the store. working here actually was pretty good all the stress it put me through was great for the time I was working here. I learned a lot about my work ethic at the time and to change it. So for that specifically it was a good experience. This is a good starting job, but not something I'd ever want to stay in."
good,"A typical day at work was stressful in unnecessary ways."
good,"Working at Party City is your typical retail job. Learn the basics of customer service, inventory management, and working with superiors. Decent enough part time job but don't expect a lot of advancement."
good,"It's very interesting at first, but then you get use to it. There is nothing changing at all. Especially the pay. State minimum wage $7.25. There are not supervisor positions or any room to move up in the store. The managers work you like a dog and you're always there at least an hour after you're scheduled to leave. It's nice for a first job but not a career. You always have free time because the hours are always short and only three days a week, if you're lucky four."
good,lots of customer service
good,"Providing customers with excellent customer service and the hardest part is stocking shelves, answering phones, and waiting on customers while the management is sitting in the office."
good,Party city at times can be a great job cause they teach you how to impervice with how to add to th costumes to make them real looking.
good,"A typical day at work would be answering multi phone lines, assisting customers, preparing balloon orders, providing customer service. I have learned since I have been at party city is that in each position that I have had in customer service each corporation may be different but we all agree on one thing providing great customer service to our customers. I have learned within the corporation is that not everyone is the same and not everyone believes the same things but we all try to work as a team and we get threw the day faster. The hardest part of my job is not caring items that our on our website that we do online. The most enjoyable part of my job is being around people, providing customer service, making a customer laugh, smile and have good things to say about our company and also myself."
good,Okay enviorment. It is a nice place to work. You meet a lot of different people. The holidays are some what busy especially halloween. overall okay job.
good,Let‚Äôs just get to it the general manger is a horrible person and down right disgusting. She picks a chooses and her favorites y‚Äôall about the other along with her. However i loved my coworkers that keep communication with me is was fun they customers where amazing. This a a Halloween based store so around that time it‚Äôs fun but business is at a all time high i would recommend to not work here honestly.
good,"There is a constant change in management, lack of clear communication throughout the store, Co-workers are friendly, but don't always get along. The schedule isn't organized, hours aren't given out evenly. Not good for long term job, good for beginner experience."
good,the whole company doesn't even make sense. the district manager keeps a general manager who doesn't know how to do basic sales associate things and he's the general manager. both district and general just sit on their butts while the assistant managers actually run the store and don't get paid enough
good,I believed that when i was working there i was learning from people who loved their job at most liked it. I guess the managers didnt want people to get a longer lunch break which was at most 10 mins. i was mainly on-call.
good,Though it can get busy during the holidays the remainder of the year can be quite boring with you mostly maintaining busy work.  It helped me with learning how to small talk but I was not given the ability to move up despite my qualification.
good,"In my experience there is not a lot of consistency in store standards/operations, resulting in a negative work environment. Management has a long way to go on their leadership skills."
good,when I worked there it was very busy for the halloween holiday season and the managers were not very helpful and expected you to just know everything without being trained
good,Party City is a growing company. In that being said the company has a lot to learn and is far behind on processes and main key day to day operations. Like all retailers alike they struggle with minimal hours vs. task and customer service ratio. Training was rushed and not backed by management leading in failure of knowledge of key functions and operations. No distribution center for stores product lead to a lot of delivery issues and unorganized deliveries to the store wasting payroll and time on unnecessary tasks.
good,the hardest part of the job is meeting deadlines for season/holiday change. theres not much room for advancement for a fulltime job. overall it was fun to work with the other employees
good,The job was consist of employees helping customers around the store. Also unloading trucks  then stocking the merchandise on to the shelves. Plus we would help our co-worker if they needed assistance with the customer.
good,"Fun environment, exciting seasonal set ups. Sub par management that plays favorites, not enough job opportunity to move up in the company. Not enough pay."
good,"Party City can be a fun job or a stressful job. I started as a associate and moved all the way to a manager. The job is pretty simple itself, but the pay is pretty low and they put A LOT on your plate considering when you have no staff. There is no staff due to no hours. Then you get in trouble because you are behind but there is no staff to complete the tasks. I used to love working here, but now I am trying to leave because it really has become too stressful."
good,working at party city was fun as it was Halloween. very busy place never a dull moment. only a couple good managers. was a good place to work and learn.
good,I enjoyed this job because it didn‚Äôt require much and it was a pretty slow paced job that I worked at during high school and they were flexible with my schedule and always understood that school came first which is very important.
good,The store was ran by people who thought it should be ran different way so u have people teaching two different ways to do things and then they would get frustrated if it wasn't the way they wanted it done .
good,"Management treated employees bad, minimum wage, barely any hours, Halloween is a busy time of year, and Holliday's are nice when for when you need the hours."
good,"Didn‚Äôt give a lot of hours breaks were too short, you had to work and talk to people while walking around and making sure everything was good bc they would only have 1 person on the floor"
good,"In charge of daily accounting reconciliations and deposits."
good,"I was young when I first got this job. It was OKAY for a first job but for someone who has been in the working world, it isn't anything to brag about. My review is totally biased because I worked at a store that was privately owned. I would imagine a corporate party city would have been a lot easier to work for. The owner had a ridiculous amount of made up rules that made customers very unhappy. Started as a cashier and got promoted to front end supervisor after 2 years. Halloween season was stressful, but we made the best of it. Made some good friends at the company. That probably the only good part of it. Thanks for the experience."
good,Party city is a fun but stressful place to work depending on the managers you have. They have alot of people working there  that deserve to move up in the company but they don't give them a chance.
good,"A typical day at work was not at all bad. There was a good environment so it was fine. The management however, was horrible. Nobody knew what they were doing and they would put that stress on the employees."
good,Un poco pesado ya que era una tienda grande y muy pocos vendedores. No hab√≠a equilibrio entre las horas de trabajo y las horas libres
good,The best part of the job is helping customers and seeing the children come in excited over a birthday party. There is a big turnover in management but that has to due with the fast pace of the job.
good,I was a sales associate. However managers would always leave the store and keep me there alone during our busiest hours. I never got the raises I was promised.
good,"Maintained an exceptionally organized sales floor."
good,"It was my first job while still in high school, when I worked there I do not think they actually cared about their employees and how they may deserve a raise."
good,Workplace environment was fun. Management did not communicate very well. The hardest part of the job was communicating with the management team. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationship between employees and management.
good,"I worked for party city for almost 2 years. While it did help me pay through my college courses it wasn't the most positive work environment. Yes, helping customers was the highlight of my job; but, working for an owner who requires perfection or you get a ""write-up"" (3 of which and you're fired) it was constant nerve wracking."
good,"Most of the managers suck, they don't really value your presence or time and the customers will have attitudes just prepare for a kind of hectic work space"
good,Partycity is great when u make it great corp doesnt care about anything except money its alot of work flr not the right amount of money the shipments are never ending they want everthing done yesterday with no hours
good,"Not the best job if you're staying long term. However, the seasonal work is nice and pays fairly well. The work around the Halloween season is hard. The store is hectic from open to close but it's good experience for working under pressure."
good,Other than that the company is constantly changing and it always varies to suit the needs of the company not the customers and employees. It is especially bad if you work for a franchise. There are almost always problems at the registers and in almost every other part of the store. The store I worked at was always overrun with cartons of freight on the floor because of the lack of space for the products we were sent. The roof was leaking in at least a dozen places and a customer was seriously hurt when she slipped in a puddle. The equipment was old and went down often which caused customers to have to wait and the employees unable to do their jobs properly. Those are just a few things I can think of right now.
good,"Working at Party City really meant stressful days of running around trying to do not only my job but other people's jobs as well since many people did not do their jobs efficiently or properly. I learned a lot of time management skills, how to work with a team, and a lot of valuable leadership skills that really help to form the process of creating wellrounded and thoughout plans that are truly effective. My co-workers tended to slack off a little bit, but that provided numerous opportunities for me to step up and get leadership experience by providing opportunities to teach them new and more efficient ways to do tasks. The hardest part about working at Party City was getting my mangaers to really listen to my feedback and get them to help me with difficult situations. Even with the difficulties I faced the every day contact with customers being able to help them find what they needed to make their party what they wanted was the best feeling. Customers truly made Party City a great place to be."
good,lots of work to be done but little bit of hours. there be so much work but only have two employees and one manager. days like that work can not always be done because you still have to help customers in be between.
good,Like the job and environment but barely get any hours. Sometimes its insanely busy and can become difficult . Don't want to continue working there if I only work 2 days .
good,It is mostly understood that this is a job for a teenager in school who needs work. They have yet to understand this fact. Over scheduling workers who clearly ask for days off who cannot not work due to school and life matters
good,"Management was not so nice to newbies. They favor their veterans, you have to work so hard to get on their good side. "
good,Party city is a productive and fun work place. I gained better knowledge on how to handle customer service in a professional manner.
good,"prepare to to open for first time"
good,they only keep on people there that show up late or hung over and have no goal for anything better in the future.
good,"I was a nice place to work, but only temporary. I wasn't getting enough hours to afford what I needed to afford."
good,Not the best place to work for everybody slacked off i felt like i was the only one trying and working for my paycheck.
good,"The work environment is okay but its the behind the scenes action that's terrible. Such as management , hours and pay rate."
good,We are able to work at a comfortable pace. Co-workers make the day interesting and management is easy to work with/for.
good,It was an ok place to work other than it being boring. The only thing that was really bad was the management. The managers were a complete mess they would not schedule anyone for most of the hours then txt people on the group chat begging if someone could come in the last min since they didn't schedule anyone.
good,"So I was hired as a Seasonal Cashier with the possibility of becoming a part time employee after the Halloween Season. I was the first new hire for the season and was very excited. Training was easy some of the other employees were nice. As the month continued more and more people were hired until I was only working 10- 15 hours per week because there weren't enough hours for everyone. I was always on time never called in and did my job well. Until they randomly stopped putting me on the schedule for a whole week! I asked the assistant manager what was going on and she said I would have to talk to the store manager next time I worked which was the next Saturday a week later. That Saturday I went into work like normal and went in to check the schedule for the following week and I wasn't on it. The manager comes in and says "" Thats what I wanted to talk to you about. Today is going to be your last day here. You can either stay and work the shift or go home. We are overstaffed."" I had no warning I hadnt been talked to at all. The season had just started and I got laid off at the start of the busy season!"
good,Good people love the working environment you have your good and your bad days there but you would like working there just have fun and do what you are supposed to do there.
good,Helping customers with a particular party idea or give suggestions to meet their party goals. Making balloon orders and cashing them out to purchase their ballons. Grabbing costumes for customers.
good,"It was an alright experience, the customers were very rude and had attitude for when I didnt have some of their costumes available for their size. The workplace was nice just one person in particular brought the energy down by being rude to his other co workers. However I learned how to work under pressure."
good,"I was extremely excited to work at this establishment when I was first hired. The management team was very disorganized and made it extremely difficult work environment when it came to scheduling, asking for time off, any questions with the store, and especially when it came to the customers."
good,"I was just a seasonal helper when I needed some extra cash around the holiday times. It was a little bit chaotic but, it was a Halloween store around Halloween time. Lol."
good,"This place was very fun and has a very supportive vibe to it. This was mostly experienced during the Halloween season as it did get very busy but everyone in the building was very calm and collected. Therefore, everyone can think clearly."
good,"At time I worked at party city privately owned, poor management and poor owner. Did care about her employees. She allowed her sister to come in and boss and put people down. Didn‚Äôt care about employees health or family."
good,productive and exciting line of work however management culture is terrible. Growth is a possibility but with growth comes tons of work and some of the higher ups are never satisfied with results. It is hard to Gage how well you are doing in the company because constructive criticism is lacking
good,The salary for this company is really low. I don't think it's worth all the hard work if you're in college or just in the work field. Definitely  recommend to high school kids.
good,Everyday I would walk in clock in and stand in one place sometimes for 9 hours just checking out customers. It was very easy but since everything was getting half off and more each week the more people started to buy and the longer lines would get and I typically was  the only one on the register which made it more stressful. I would say the best part was having at least a 15 minute break because it felt like I could take a breather but other than the fast face which I loved it felt like I was the only one working which that was the stressful part.
good,Party City isn't a job you want to try to live off of unless you're a manager. They pay minimum wage and will cut hours at a moments notice without remorse. Management sucks at training and lacks communication. They will also make you stay past your scheduled time closer to Halloween.
good,"Ringing up orders, blowing up balloons, taking balloon orders, and stocking the shelves.  The hardest part of this job was being on my feet the majority of my shift.  I enjoyed working with the public and the staff."
good,"The Team Was Amazing, They made holidays come to life. Everything was great loved it there . Should pay more . The breaks should be longer and they should hire more people. Party City is a big store"
good,"Stocking whole store, maintaining the store making sure it looks appealing to customers interest in merchandise, while at the same time giving great customer service and completing tasks given from manager before leaving."
good,They will seriously suck your life away from you. Management only care about themselves. I got in a car accident around 3:00 AM one morning and broke my wrist and they expected me to come to work later on that day. They didnt ask how i was doing or anything !
good,"lots of hours if you asked for them, management was rocky, fun for a first time job, upbeat environment, blowing up balloons sucked, probably not a longterm job"
good,It was my first job also seasonal. The first day the manager made me cry over my first mistake telling everyone I was mentally slow. After that day he got better though and I improved with his help. All the seasonal workers were friendly but the full time workers were very mean and wanted nothing to do with us or help in any way. Towards the end of the season the manager said he wanted to keep me permanently but ended up only keeping me an extra day only because he wanted me to clean up while the full time workers had a pizza party.
good,"full time employees don't like having part time people taking hours away from them.Never worked a job where the full time employees voted as to whether to keep you on or let you go, forget your job performance it's a popularity contest!"
good,I learned so much about the management side of running a business. such a huge lesson here. They taught me so much. I think store managers have a lot on their shoulders. If they paid their employees a little better they might have a better organization.
good,"- Wore a headset. "
good,"Party City was the first job I ever had at age 15 and I worked at the balloon counter. I thoroughly enjoyed my job for a while but the hours were long for a 15 year old with a work permit (4-5 days a week with 8-10 hour shifts). Most of my coworkers were pleasant, but some were also ex-convicts. It is fast-paced especially around Halloween, and I enjoyed it for a while, but then the owners sold the store to corporate and then my hours were cut drastically and I would only work 1 day a week with a 4 hour shift. I worked there for a year and I did not receive any bonuses. I was also looked down upon because of my age and was often called out and picked on. It is a decent high school and college job."
good,"When they got busy it was very dysfunctional and unorganized , all workers had different priorities and  no structure nor showed up most of the time . When i was laid off the manager did not tell me and i went to work for 4 days with out pay ."
good,You‚Äôre paid very little. It‚Äôs a simple job and not hard . It‚Äôs a job to do if you‚Äôre looking for a paycheck and not trying to enjoy what you‚Äôre actually doing .
good,My experiences at Party City for the past six years have not been great. I can barely afford to live with the pay I get and I get horrible benefits. I am the Assistant Manager and I get treated horribly.
good,"It‚Äôs a great place, so many ideas for parties. But you can‚Äôt live off what you make there. Unless your friends with management .  Your always told what you do wrong, never the positive.  You work once a week and get told your emails are horrible and threatened to get fired. It‚Äôs frustrating. The costumers are amazing and so are the night managers ."
good,"It was only a few months long, but we had ridiculous hours and long nights with early mornings to follow. To have it as a first ever job, it was tough, and going to college as well."
good,"Not much training, very much a 'wing it' attitude in the workplace. Not much professionalism, but not a terrible place to work at. Hours were fairly flexible and everyone was kind enough."
good,Working at Party City helped e apply myself to real life scenarios. This job kept you on your toes for I worked here during Halloween which is there most busy season.  The manger was sometimes available for questions or concerns but mainly expected you to know by your first day on the job.
good,it's a good job to work at if your starting out. its really calm at the beginning but once October rolls around it is very cut throat and intense at times.
good,"This was a seasonal position, you got long hours due to Halloween "
good,"Atmosphere changes regularly, dependent on who your working with manager wise. There's many responsibilities that associates need to handle on their own. The training when you hire in seems lacking for what they actually expect you to be able to output while working. Many training details get overlooked till it becomes a problem later and then you still might not have it explained well to you. Hours are always up in the air unless your full time which need a minimum of 30 hours."
good,"cleaning the store sometimes being a cashier "
good,"A typical day at Party City can consist of anything from full-filling of all balloon orders..walk in and pre-booked/pre-purchased, Down stocking of merchandise, receiving and staging of store merchandise,  assisting customers, returns and recovery of the store. "
good,"depending on your management, the place can be really busy at the wrong times and nothing will get done by the end of the work shift. Employees are really nice , also depending on the management of employment. Its a nice job if you want to work a lot for low pay."
good,Working at Party City is a great job for young teens trying to get their first job. However I would recommend applying only as a seasonal worker because their is more to do and time goes by fast.
good,"A typical day at work was always a fast paced shift and filled with customers from opening to closing. There was no organization in the store or back room. Although it is a fun work place during the changing holidays, I do not recommend growing with this company."
good,"It was a fun environment to work in , the customers were very nice and outgoing. The mangers were cool people also.We had a lot of fun during the halloween season"
good,"The Halloween city I worked for had a dream team working there. I would have gone insane there if it weren't for the people I worked with. The job was basic retail, state minimum pay, rude customers, awful and inconsistent hours. But our managers suggested we have fun at work to pass time and ease stress, so we wore costumes and took turns putting hats on each other while we worked. Certainly helped moral."
good,"I worked here for 2 years when I was still in high school. It was my first job. The manager is okay, can be hard sometimes. Staff members were fun but most of the people used to work with don‚Äôt work there no more. Halloween is the best time to work there, so fun but can be stressful."
good,"Good General Manager, but thats about all their is to working here other than the employee discount. Their is not much you can look forward to working for them, and no one is able to be a full time employee besides general management so your hours will be at the MOST 39 per week. The only time you'll get that though, is during the busy seasons like Halloween. Other than that you'll see at MOST 20 hours weekly."
good,It gets super hectic in the Halloween season.  but staying busy during my shifts made my days fly by. If you are looking for a seasonal job I recommend applying at Party City. Fun atmosphere over all.
good,Many holidays per year and little time to switch seasons. Many mistakes are made because of limited hours to complete. In between seasons the labor issued to the stores are not enough to keep the store up to the standards that they expect.
good,"Not a fun place to work at. "
good,This seasonal experience taught me the basics of what a typical retail job is like. A typical day at work was working on the cash register and making sure that customers were properly assisted.
good,Always something new and exciting happening.   Great environment for a young individual who is just starting on life's adventures unless your going into upper management.
good,There is no growth & development just something to have to keep gas in your car. I do not believe in down talking so i just know that jobs is not for me.
good,Like any other target giant retail is not the best place to work at the hours are unpredictable and there is no room for advancement and the pay is not that great either
good,"This place was just okay to work for.  The work is inconsistent, they tell you what your job will be, but you do everything but what your job title is.  Management is okay, but again inconsistent.  Pay is alright, good place to start off as a first job."
good,The employees were very friendly. I like that the job was able to work around my schedule. I feel that the job could use more to do.
good,"A lot of fun around Halloween, however work hours are very unstable.  Many of the opportunities are not merit based.  A lot of logistical issues.  Management is ok, pretty supportive however problem solving skills in the corporate management is lacking."
good,"That's what we were required to ask people when we helped them find Halloween costumes. Required. I felt like an idiot. Didn't much care for the job. The people who worked there year round treated the seasonal employees poorly. The store owner/manager was awesome, but seldom worked the same shifts as me. The night manager was a jerk. He liked to flirt with all the girls that were 10+ years younger than him, and treated you poorly if you didn't flirt back."
good,"Doing same thing every day, nothing learned, average but good, good to work with others people, no advancement, day off."
good,I worked at party city for a month for the Halloween season. Fast paced. Had to climb ladders. I enjoyed the amount of work I had to do.
good,Typically the day goes by fast. learned how to do things i didn't know how to use before. Management is good. The co-workers are nice. There really in no hard part to the job.
good,"very long hours, not enough pay. seemed a little hard as far as working with others. job should be more than seasonal. I did learn a bit more as to what customers really want in retail. Learning how employees should work together and not apart"
good,"Meet some new people, help people find the costumes that the want, good coworkers controlled temperature, get to wear costumes during work"
good,"Party City could be a good place to work for if it weren't for poor management. There is no teamwork. No one ever says anything good. It's a very negative environment and not family friendly for the employees. They do not give enough employee hours to get the necessary daily work completed. The store is chaotic and not under control. The district manager will tell you to do one thing and the store manager will tell you to do something different. There is a lack of communication and lack of respect for the employees. You can never have a day off because they will just call you and tell you your on 6 days a week with no notice. And when you are off work the manager will call you to gripe about everything. You literally have to eat, breathe, and live Party City. There is no room left to have a personal life because your always at work and by the time you make it home you're so exhausted from the constant running around you do all day that all you want to do is catch up on sleep."
good,"Prepared food for customers, also cashed out customers meals. Helped coworkers with their situations."
good,"I work my butt off to get my job done and all I do is get treated like garbage, don't get me wrong it is an ok job but the people there don't treat you with any respect"
good,"A typical work day will drive you up the walls. There are many tasks that need to be done in a timely fashion, but without the time. There is a severe miscommunication between the expectations and reality. Management is always stressed and results in the staff being stressed 100% for tasks that they are not qualified to do. There is never enough staff to complete tasks and there is no quality trining to efficiently prepare staff for the tasks."
good,Well I only worked here for a month and that was for the Halloween Season during that month we had about 3 different store managers. But overall it was ok!
good,I got the opportunity to dress in costumer for shifts and work the costume section of the store as well as be a cashier. My manager was fun and upbeat.
good,A typical day at work was very busy being a party city made mec learn that you have to be patient with the guest but at the same time fast my co workers were really cool and helpful. There really wasnt no hard part of the job it was very easy. The most enjoyable part of my job was making the customers happy
good,You never know what you will run into here. It is a very fun environment. I think the balloons are my favorite part about the store.
good,"Working with the company was an experience is about the best that I can say. I don't know if it was just the party city in my location but not again there. I basically spent my time working hard for very little pay. The best thing about my experience was meeting my co-workers, who were actually cool."
good,"Sales to sale "
good,"This was a great place, always fun and out going people. I had the chance to move up in management really face with it being a seasonal job."
good,"A typical day of work varies depending on the season. Halloween through Christmas is nonstop hustling. The most valuable thing I learned was how to approach someone,quickly assess their needs, and help them accordingly. Co-workers varied in age and personality which made the dynamic unique. The hardest part of the job by far was putting the store back together after the seasonal crowds. However, until the store was reset no one went home. This led to my favorite part. I guess it was the shared responsibility and mutual desire to get out that led everyone to chip in and close the day out strong. Most of the employees had a good attitude and knew how each other felt. We discovered wigs, costumes, silly voices, accessories and goofy names were perfect for lifting moral after a long day. No one wanted to restore the isles, but we found coming up  with theories to explain the mayhem entertaining. For instance, Frankenstein Elvis having a debate with a Ninja Turtle over what each respectively thought happened. There are no words to accurately convey the jollification these skits brought us."
good,Sell costumes
good,"My typical day was ok, I would stay busy finding things to do and work on when management was just ""chilling"" in the office. I was only seasonal, but the ragular employees acted as if they were seasonal just not taking the job seriously. To break it down it was a good source of money because of the hours and overtime, but a poor facility of workers."
good,low pay for management. A lot of standing around waiting on something to do. Halloween very hectic and recently just established a great process for the busy season.
good,I only worked for a short time at this company so this may be fairly short.
good,"All customers enjoying themselves, until December 30th, then panic sets in.. Also customers seem to think they're given the right to pick up, wear, and toss about anything in the store.."
good,"Good place for students if your not in management. Pay is not well, they only give .13 cent raises once every year that's if you do good. the company piles up on merchandise and you need to pack it all out even when there are no places to put it. most of these stores have a little stockroom, and expect you to work piles of merchandise into it."
good,"if your 24 years old like me, you can definitely have something better by now. but its a job, and its better than nothing, especially right now in these tough times. all i can tell you is expect to work like a dog for $8 an hour, unless you stick around long enough and try to manage and try to get a promotion. it also depends which party city you work at, their all different. the one i work at i would give it a 3 out of 5. co workers are good, managers are average, assistant manager is very good hes literally the only one i can talk to about anything."
good,"It's a good place to work, fun and cool. Meeting new people is cool."
good,It was fun helping cusomter dress up and having to dress up as well. The employees were always helpful. The one thing I did not like was climbing on really tall ladders.
good,"boss was very contradictive, expected too much to get done in small amount of time. When really busy he didnt accept any reason for nothing not getting done."
good,"It was my first job, and I met alot of people an learned customer servise skills and gained more people skills over all it was great"
good,"Worked for this company for 6 years, got hired during Halloween and loved the fast paced interactions and customers were pretty good. Learned quickly that after season work pace was dreadfully slow and there are no real regular customers, most just come for what they need but regardless they were fairly nice. Management however was terrible, many internal squabbles and there was no real opportunities to get promoted, the company preferred to hire outside individuals who had prior management skills. Overall work was fairly hard but nothing too difficult and the pay was mediocre, again no real opportunities to advance there either. My favorite part of the job however was the balloon counter, that alone made my day better blowing balloons up for customers."
good,"I enjoyed working at Party City, there was more to do and more people to talk to during the holidays, but during the off seasons the store is very slow and hours are not always guaranteed."
good,Its ok for a first job. But there a lot of work to be done and it gets really busy during Halloween and graduation . I got almost 50 hours a week during these time but once summer hit i was lucky enough to even get 12 hours. I really enjoyed the people i worked with though. Super nice and willing to help. Its a lot to clean and you realize how messy and lazy people are.
good,"There aren't a lot of opportunities for advancement, and the overall environment isn't one I'd want to stay in even if a promotion was available. The pay increase for some promotions doesn't seem like it would be worth it for the amount of responsibilities gained. And the way that customers treat employees isn't worth the minimum wage you're paid."
good,"During a typical shift, you are to clean, help customers (most of the time they decline or look down on you for being in their bubble and having a happy spirit), push push push for emails and surveys because your store is graded on it and the surveys will determine your work reference for future employers (in an all or nothing mind frame), answer phones and customer questions."
good,"Managing job work/ life was a challenge after store cut back, this placed all the additional 40 hour workload onto manager. Profit on people became the model for the company."
good,"My specific experience at Party City has been very tumultuous, at first it was a great job. Very close knit team, open communication, and generally a fun environment."
good,"I was hired in October to be seasonal for Halloween. During that time it was very fast paced and there was always something to do. After Halloween was over the only things to do were pack and unpack boxes and stock. Usually there was only one manager and one employee, so there wasn‚Äôt anyone to even talk to to get through a shift."
good,"The party city in Saint Joseph Missouri was alright. The general manager was cool and the other managers were alright. But too much drama. Some certain co workers would go around and tell everyone your business that you told them in confidence, and the one manager would often talk bad about co workers to other co workers."
good,"Working there was a fun time, conversing with customers and associates during Halloween time. But during that same season, it was incredibly busy and the staff wasn't necessarily short, but was rather, mismanaged. One person would be doing next to nothing one hour and then carrying the entire store's weight the next, meanwhile no change in business happened."
good,"A typical day at work would be understaffed. Often times a lot of scheduling hours will go to management, leaving associated little hours. Unfortunately, I can not find any bright moments from a typical work day at Party City. The hardest part of the job is not being able to always satisfy customer needs due to the small amount of associates, scheduled throughout the days."
good,This was a good place to work at first and it‚Äôs very flexible for students but there are no hours. There‚Äôs too many managers and corporate doesn‚Äôt care to cut hours. If you need consistent hours don‚Äôt work here.
good,"Since switching from franchise to corporate, there has been no guidance, sufficient training, or communication. It is difficult to accomplish tasks at their standards without staff/payroll hours or space for product."
good,Great place to work during the seasonals. Can get a little hectic. A  bit stressful. Overall okay place to make a little extra money. Employees arent very nice.
good,"Friendly environment, welcoming workplace. My hours were very good for me. I am still a minor, therefore Party City was flexible with my schedule and had me work on days I was available."
good,"Great thing I am a fast learner because time was very limited. Working in retail strengthened my memory. Causes you to remember where things are located, how to set up, prices of products and etc. Great working environment! Very fast pace and busy."
good,i was a seasonal employee just doing my job at the fitting room accounting for all the merchandise that came in and out of the rooms. it was only me i stood all day felt like i couldn't leave my area. i went to the restroom when it was really busy during halloween and they got upset at me. so i really wasn't satisfied with my job because of the pay and had better places to go
good,the job is ok. during Halloween it gets hectic and you need to learn how to crowd control and there is no training for that part you just have to learn on the job whats best for you.
good,Was fun for the most part. Most days can be slow. Halloween was really busy.  Manager never liked dealer with upset customers. Would hide alot in office.
good,Great for College students. Not too demanding and its at the mall. Hours are flexible. Just be on time and enjoy learning communication skill with customers.
good,Working at this job taught me how to perfect my management skills. I love the people I work with because they make the work place easy going and smooth.
good,Corporate should stop being stingy with hours for associates and expecting too much from associates when they don‚Äôt get paid enough. The management and most associates are very unprofessional and it makes the work environment toxic and stressful.
good,"Party City can be a fun place to work. We can dress up at Halloween and holidays, and we get to help people celebrate. The hours are inconsistent and nearly unmanageable from mid August through the first to second week of November. It is typically easy to request time off, but nearly impossible in that time, Halloween season. The pay is low. From my position I cannot move further up and I do not even make nine dollars per hour. For many, this is a second or high school job."
good,I was a Seasonal Halloween Helper so it was a temp job just for a month or two during the Halloween sales. The job was very simple it was mainly to sell costumes and keep the Halloween section clean. I had to take orders from customers and go to the back stockroom to pull out the costumes and deliver it to the customers. The hardest part of the job was how busy it got the closer to Halloween came especially when the costumes were selling out the customers were getting more angrier.
good,The main job you have is making sure everything is in stock for Halloween. Most people are fine to work with and some not so much. Management was a bit hard but looking back it was probably because of the some of the people they hired
good,"Most of the time there i would consider very unorganized."
good,A typical day was; You go clock in. Go to your station. Mine was the dressing rooms. Stand there. Take costumes back onto the shelves. Clean dressing rooms up. Clock out.Go home.
good,Short lunches and not having the work schedule laid out in time for the week ahead. They also would not tell you when you needed to go in and really short notice if they did.
good,The job was nice but it is not a career more of a summer job or something for high school students. Not enough pay and not enough hours for everyone. Some of the management were helpful but other were not.
good,"I learned a little bit of teamwork only cause I was their seasonal for halloween, so we had to work as a team to get stuff down and in order. Management was whatever.."
good,It's a good job for young adults and high schoolers. There is a lot of heavy lifting involved when stocking but otherwise the job is pretty easy aside from holidays.
good,"Working at party city was fun but concerns were never addressed by management. Often times we worked over hours, didn't take lunches and were not compensated for extra time worked."
good,"Although the job was fun and fast paced, the career advancement opportunities were minimal, and the minimum wage was no longer cutting it. Halloween month was always the toughest!"
good,"The management never worked with me on my hours, and always scheduled me when I said I couldn't work due to other responsibilities. Other than that, the rest of the work was busy and somewhat fun. Lots of balloons."
good,"Poor management, gave me way more shifts then I agreed to, booked me on days I had said I wouldn't be available in my interview and never gave me any direction or training once I arrived at work."
good,"It was a great company to work with at the beginning but after Halloween all hours were cut back gradually. I went from working 40+ hours a month to not being scheduled for 2+ weeks. The management is really poor, and only the GM takes their role seriously."
good,"Employees often rude. Basically, I worked in the back handing out Halloween costumes to customers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the other employees, they often were rude/"
good,They took me in with no experience which was very helpful to a kid just starting out. I worked there are the company was changing over from Iparty to Party City and the place instantly became more organized.
good,After halloween hours where cut from five days a week to two days a week. Managers were lazy and i did not receive proper training. The hardest part of the job was being the only one working the register.
good,"Three shifts, usually 5 hrs. not many hours available to associates as corporate doesn't provide much to stores. stressful environment with low pay and no room for advancement. unprofessional environment with immature managers."
good,You get customers yelling at you and your work is never being appreciated no matter how hard you bust yourself. You're always running like a chicken with its head cut off because there never enough hours to have enough associates.
good,"working at Party City kept me on my feet. it was fast paced, and also you had to have excellent customer service. helping people on the sales floor with costumes or party necessities. Stocking in the backroom using a ladder to get things off the shelf, and also to put packages in order."
good,"Honestly, the main manager never liked me, Overall it is a nice place to work at and every co-worker is nice they try to help you if you're stuck on something."
good,"I was able to learn a lot. Operation of a cash register. Dealing with the public, which was not always simple. I helped remodel the store so I did basic maintenance. Most of the employees and management I got along with. My biggest issue was that some of the classes I was taking at the time at UNR required more attention than I was able to dedicate to them because of work. It was for that reason that I had to step away from work and concentrate on school. Now that I have only a couple of classes left before I graduate, I need a full-time job."
good,"halloween city is extremely unorganized and no matter how well you clean and organize as soon as you blink its a mess again. on top of that the money you get paid is horrible. as a seasonal job you'd expect maybe $8 an hour since we have to deal with people rushing in for the season."
good,"Working at Party City was ok. The management team was awful. They were almost unresponsive the needs of the their employees, there was favoritism in the store among employees and management, and it sometimes got inappropriate."
good,I worked there as a seasonal employee over the month of October. I liked most of the people I worked with but they worked me more hours than I said I could do when I had started.
good,The amount of work you put into party city I believe they should pay more. You have to restock the whole store for holidays and pack up the store for the old holidays. That isn't an easy thing to do so I believe they should pay more than minimum wage.
good,"Worked there for awhile because at the time they worked with my college schedule. But during costume season work became really stressful. You have to be patient with people there, and any retail job really."
good,"Poor district management, limiting our store manager, and thus negative moral for management which leads inadvertently to unhappy general employees.  I was taught if you have nothing but bad or negative things to say it's best to say nothing at all."
good,This was my first job seeing that I just graduated Its a out to be a year since I been there its a fun work place customers could be kinda mean but most people who come there are ina rush
good,I started working at Party City when I was much younger (teens).  I stayed because the people I worked with made the job fun.  It isn't a stressful job unless you hate balloons popping periodically.
good,"its a fun fast-paced environment to work. Associates usually really nice to work with. Employee discounts offered. hours are flexible, works well if looking for temporary employment."
good,"it wasnt great the pay was terrible and the hours you worked didnt seem to add up to the pay checks you received. it was fun sometimes, but one of the staff members front end cashier manager is so rude and nasty to not only the staff but customers as well! and was never in trouble for it even after customers complained!!! RIDICULOUS"
good,"A typical day at work will consist of unloading boxes by departments, climbing up and down ladders to top and drop stock and engaging in excellent customer service. I've learned that i work best when working as a team."
good,"Party City was one of my least favorite work places. It was nice to have as a first job but as an athlete, the management did not see sports as important as a job. I ended up leaving party city because of conflict between work and after school sports."
good,"Spend all my day at the cash register, interacting with my coworkers and customers is entertaining. Not enough hours for me to have a break on shift. Once a week I would restock candies in the front, which is enjoyable."
good,"The job helps you acquire fast paced working skills along with customer service."
good,The store went bankrupt eventually I think that speaks for itself. The supervisor was a jerk. Management did not appreciate their employees. I would never recommend working at Party City.
good,Few hours  2 days a week at most just throw you into the job managers are understanding for the most part you do get a lot of different experience in different aspects of retail
good,There was no room for improvement so i decided to move to a company I thought i could grow with. management was decent. Halloween hours were the busiest times so that made the days go by faster
good,"I was not a fan of working here, but it was a pretty okay place to start work, since I had no previous experience. I enjoyed helping the customers any way I could."
good,"It was a fun place to work, and a good starter job. However, there is no advancement opportunities until you have worked there for multiple years, and even then, you do not get to advance much."
good,"I was only there for season, but it was really fun. Halloween is their busiest time and it's VERY quick paced and slightly competitive to see who can upsale the purchase the most. The manager I worked with at the time was a doof though."
good,A typical day at party city consists of simple activities organizing and cleaning constantly and attending costumers with the best costumer service. At party city i learned to be a quicker working person and to be more organized and have time management skills. The hardest part about the job is certain holidays when the store is at its highest rate of productivity.Most enjoyable part is when you successfully help a customer.
good,"Party city was a good place to work, but didn't have the best experience since of the Halloween ordeal. Great place to work for the fast learners and for patient people."
good,"-Good place to work"
good,"A typical day at work for me was to stock shelves and ring customers up on the cash register. I learned how to properly use the cash register. The management at Party City was confusing and not well thought out. There was no workplace culture at Party City. The hardest part of the job was to reach very high standards and I could never ""reach the high standards"" as my boss said. The most enjoyable part of the job was not being around management at all."
good,"I worked as a part time cashier for two years, this role often included customers service, receptionist, studio, balloon management and top-stock. I've learn to multi-task and I've mastered the ability to spot fake bills. These skills were put to the test during our busiest season (Halloween), long hours and short breaks (avg. 7am- 11pm, with a 30 min break). Despite the chaos usually surrounding holiday the worst part about this job is the inconsistent scheduling in which you have to call in every Saturday and if the schedule is not completed by then, call on Sunday store hours (good luck if you usually work on Sunday's).Schedule aside the customers are usually what i look forward on my work days."
good,"since it was a seasonal job at halloween was their busiest season, it was hectic. Management had thrown us in without an explanation. There were also several managers at once, each one asking for something the other didn't want which only created unneeded conflicts. At the end of the season I wasn't even informed if they had kept me or not."
good,I worked at party's city for over 2yrs and after work the 3 Halloween they cut my hours from 30 hrs to 4 hrs a week. I could not afford the gas to go back and fourth for 4 hrs.
good,"Party city hires in August and September for the rush they have in October. The main problem is when the holiday passes, they lose all of the hours, and you will have to rely on trying to randomly pick up shifts to get any hours."
good,The management while I was there was not very approachable- the assistant managers interacted and were more visible. The company culture wasn't the most festive and they didn't seem interested in working with their customers in terms of saving them money.
good,loved working for finishline meeting new poeple interacting with customers daily and always making that customer happy with a pair of new kicks and socks and cant forget the shoe cleaner.
good,"Pros/ very fun work environment, everyone was so nice and willing to help in any way needed. a normal day was stocking and helping guests find a product."
good,its not so bad for a part time job. it runs normal on a typical day except weekends. i've learned to be quick and fast with the custumer service. the management its not so great they want to do allot more than i can provide for a part time. the co workers are nice and work as a team. the hardest part is provide a great service to clients who are not satisfied. the most enjoyable are the closings we can buy grocerys an hour before we finish the shift.
good,"a typical day at work included assisting customers to find party equipment. I learned basic stock training, managers and cowworkers are all fun to be around and keep you feeling uplifted. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the high demand of costumes when halloween season was on, the most enjoyable part however was satisfying customers with their party needs."
good,Customer Service and sales. Would assist customers and restock the inventory. Sold Halloween costumes and set up the store before the Grand opening.
good,"I liked that we could wear a costume on Halloween. We had some rules that most people followed. I liked the rush when we where packed. I didn't like how mean some of the bosses where when the day was slow. The owner of the Party City was really nice though. I liked how we could fix some broken items and make them look new again, that made me feel helpful. I didn't mind cleaning the toilets, I just didn't like how one of the managers made me clean it all over when it looked exactly the same as when I finished the first time."
good,I liked the people there that I worked with but the managers were mostly useless and the company polices were outragious
good,It was available when I needed some work; nothing great nothing horrible. Just a job. Not very rewarding. I didn't stay there long.
good,"helped customers find costumes that they wanted, went into stock room and picked out costumes, restocked costumes, worked register, cleaned up store."
good,The company does not promote from within. I was hired as an Assistant Manager and told I'd get training to have my own store in 6-9 months. I was the almost 5 years and it never happened. It is all about who kisses who's a*s. I would say store manager openings were filled 90% from outside the company and the remaining 10% was internal positions. Many idiotic things the company did as a whole. They'd launch new programs without testing them...always crashed. It is just a half-a*s company.
good,"Party City is a fun place to begin working at as a first job to gain experience. They have great managers and generally pretty awesome coworkers. However don't expect a full time job from them unless you are going to be a manager, they will pretty much refuse to give you full time otherwise. The work pace is generally very quick, while they want you to help customers as much as possible there generally isn't much in terms of time to do everything they ask. You also have to deal with a lot of small items and very few big items. The hardest part of the job is generally anything to do with Halloween due to the amount of customers party city gets. It can also be very hard to keep up with balloon orders on busy days if there are not enough hands on deck. "
good,I learn my first cashier experience there it was a simple steady workplace and much to do. I didn't sales and cashier everyday until in left. It was fun at times but other times it would be very serious.
good,A typical day at work: you clock in and get right to work to the register. If your the main cashier you just stay in the register area and clean around your station and help customers at the check out line. If your a back up cashier your job is to also help customers on the floor and provide great customer service. Help people find their merchandise and also pick up phone calls. I learned at this job about customer awareness. How to handle different tasks at once. The managers are okay but sometimes their language towards co-workers are not appropriate especially when they are angry. Co-workers are okay too they are usually all young in high school so they bring their high school drama to talk about at work. The hardest part of the job is really nothing because this job is easy but if i have to put a hard part it would be not having the merchandise a customer needs at the moment and the customer is unhappy. The enjoyable part of the job is the balloon counter making balloons for party event.
good,"Great coworkers, initial sales representative position. hardest part of the job was during the holidays. Most enjoyable was meeting new people."
good,"A typical day for me was to help customers, organize shelves, restock items, sweep Isles, and to retrieve items from the back storage."
good,"say hello to customers as they would walk in and out of store. management was excellent. i loved to work with all my co-workers, very friendly. hardest part was cleaning up after people. constant battle. most enjoyable part of the day was assisting customers as needed."
good,"Party City has great potential, it teaches many valuable skills such as effective time management, cooperation between staff ranking, and multitasking. The general portion of staff were friendly, open, and willing to teach on any aspect of the job. Hardest part of the job was just tying to instill the same pride in all the staff members. Learning new aspects and then being able to pass that knowledge on to the others was my favor.ite part"
good,good place to work if you are younger but your not paid very much and do not get any advancement here.
good,"I enjoy working at Party City because my co-workers are fun to be around, but they do not offer enough hours."
good,"halloween was nuets"
good,"Each Party City is structured differently, they all have different ways to get to the answer. Meaning, 2+2=4 however, 2x2=4. But we all end up at 4 somehow. A typical day is each lead is responsible for working on a project(s) but also working with customers and delegating other jobs to the other employees and making sure they complete it and complete it right. If they don't know how to do something they are to teach that employee. I learned how to work with customers, manage my employees, take direction from hire management and work on it myself and or delegate it to an employee I thought could complete the project. I also have learned to communicate with corporate on a daily basis as well. My co-workers are a lot of fun to work with. At the store I work at we are family. We are all pretty close and talk outside of work but we also know how to separate work from personal life. The hardest part of the job is saying no to my co-workers a lot of the time I am on a time schedule  so when they need help with something I have a hard time saying no to them even though I know that my entire project has to get done by the end of the night. I still as their manager take time to teach them, or help them with what they need. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with getting to know them more and teach them knew things that they might not have known otherwise. They love that and I like to see them grow in their job as I did."
good,"In any retail, you see the good, the bad, and the ugly. Learned about all types of customers on a day-to-day basis after seven years. I learned how to inflate balloons, set planograms, cross-merchandise, upsell, use a POS cash register, open/close a store, interview/train new associates, print personalized announcements/banners. Management plays favoritism a lot; your schedule is never the same. Most of my coworkers are in their early twenties or teens, mainly because of the low pay. But always become good friends outside of work. Annual rate increases are only between 1-1.5%"
good,I didn't work their long enough to get a good feel for the job.  I quit to go back to school.
good,"It is a fun place to work but it can be pretty stressful and at times it feels like the other management just puts everything on you. I enjoy my co workers a lot. We all get along very well and all have respect for each other which is a very good quality amongst co workers. I learned how to run a store pretty much by myself and open and close it. With the shifts, I always close which can be unfair because their are other managers working ..."
good,"I feel that I was descriminated against because they gave me very little hours a week even though I worked hard, made sales, did my job and more. tet the people that slacked or were dating the manager got more hours."
good,"Stocked shelves, counters, and tables with merchandise, set-up advertising displays and arranged merchandise on counters and tables to promote sales, stamped, marked, and tagged price on merchandise, obtained merchandise requested by customers, answered customers' questions concerning location, price and use of merchandise and cleaned shelves, counters, and tables."
good,"A typical day at work is to say ""hello"" to co-workers and customers as I enter the store. I will go in the back of the store where all associates clock-in and we each grab a radio/headset. I will clock-in and proceed to my register. I am always courteous to the customers who check out on my line asking them ""if they found everything okay, and if they would like to sign up to receive coupons through their e-mail"". If I don't have any customers in the store I will walk around and make sure the store looks neat and everthing is placed on the shelves correctly. I always keep myself busy even if we are having a slow period. Sometimes I will assist with stocking the shelves when we have a big shipment come in. Which I enjoy doing as well. If gives me the opportunity to learn which products we have and to know exact location so it is easier to locate for the customers. My management team is fantastic! They are always very courteous and helpful. The make working there a very light and comfortable atmosphere. My co-workers are nice, they all have their different personalities of course but we all work as a team and thats what makes our store great! I really don't believe there is anything hard about my job. It's not a hard or difficult job you have to be a team player and you have to enjoy working with the public. That is what I love the most, interacting with people."
good,You'll work hard usually at the registers or in the back room.
good,"Busy days, slow evenings, low pay, but great environment to work."
good,"No day at Party City was the same. There are so many vastly different things that need to be done, from displays, to restocking, to balloon orders. Overall the work environment is quite nice, with management relatively nice and cooperative, however the work ours were scare, if any, and would change without notice."
good,Decent job.  Nice store manager.  Pay was ok though could have been a little better considering all the running you did there especially at holiday times.  Only kept for seasonal work.
good,"It's always busy, especially on a Saturday. Always blowing up balloons. The management is okay it's not great. It is a fun place to work. The co-worker is nice and would help you if you need help."
good,Worked a few years and every Halloween and other festive days of the year were pretty dreadful in terms of the amount of work you had to put in. Overall my staff was friendly and kept me around as long as I did. Pay sucked though.
good,A typical day at work can be either really stressful with the time limits or really boring with standing at the register with nothing to do. One of the hardest parts of the job is dealing with management who only sees things there way and don‚Äôt want to listen to their employees. Who are trying to make things easier for everyone.
good,This company is a fun company to work for. The training process they seriously need to work on that but it‚Äôs fine. My former co-workers were very nice and helpful. What I don‚Äôt like is they are very unsure about what they want and who they want. They only have room for 10 employees there. And won‚Äôt keep nor hire more than that permanently. They only hire temporary anyway.
good,"I worked during Halloween to Thanksgiving and the way the manage the place was very unorganized and lazy. They gave me tasks to do and I would finish them and I would be standing for hours until assigned finally something to do, some days I would just stand all day, good for a first job but not a career."
good,"The flexibility is good, the pay is okay at a first time job, but you eventually want more which sometimes you will not get a pay raise. You learn how to customer service skills and money handling which is good."
good,"My experience at Party City was very positive.  I learned how to handle large amounts of people at once, returns, handling money and starting conversation with everyone who came through my line.   It was a fun place to work and everyone I worked with was easy to get along with.  But management was very very poor and so were the hours I was receiving.  They varied from 20 hours a week to 5.  I was always promised more hours but never saw them.  We were very understaffed with very poor payroll.  I needed something new and more reliable so I oit my 2 weeks in and moved on."
good,"You're just a number on the sheet. The continue to demand more tasks and continue to cut hours, company does not care about their employees but only about money."
good,Corporate likes to reduce hours while increasing hourly expectations. Any staff int he store are stretched to the max every hour of every shift. Turn over is high.
good,"Party City has taught me a lot, and prepared me to work in any environment. You must be efficient, because there is so much required of you, but you must also offer the highest level of customer service."
good,The job itself isn't too bad but they really get on you for not meeting the requirement of emails. They do not understand that not everyone wants to give emails
good,I worked there part time so any benefits they had for people I didn't get. Pretty much a pretty good place to work but you have to be best friends with a certain manager to have a good day. The hardest part of the job was the one manager that was unfair.
good,"it was a seasonal job, so not really a full time job. Its good if you want a job for the Halloween season. other than that, I have no comments or any negative things to say."
good,Work/home life balance is not valued in my opinion.  Payroll hours versus amount of tasks and freight that is given does not balance.  Very task driven company who is trying to flip a switch  to be customer centric.
good,Like any retail job it is incredibly stressful. The fun members of management are what can make the job worthwhile. Basically a smaller version of a Walmart.
good,Party City could be a fun place to work if corporate actually tried to fix the issues that have been building up for a while. Very inconsistent staffing that leads to ridiculously stressed out GMs and irritated employees. Too much drama and contrary to what you may think - customers are often in a bad mood and will be aggressive toward you. Not the fun environment you imagine.
good,"The work environment didn't flow very well. The store was typically always a mess, or merchandise was always getting stolen. Management there wasn't the best."
good,"Party City was not the most ideal place to gain some working experience. The environment was not terrible since my co-workers were quite nice. I enjoy jobs that are stimulating and can make me think differently as I work.  At Party City, the tasks were always the same and they got quite tedious."
good,It's a good place to start at but of your looking to advance in the company you won't the people are nice and theres a lot  of fun things for a party.
good,"If you're new to Party City then learning the layout of the whole store is difficult because you only get one zone work with at the start after they give you a quick over view of the store. I got started with one zone and learned it pretty well but when some one asked about a product outside my zone I could do no more than point vaguely in the direction I thought it was or ask over the walkie talkies. The veteran employees where much better at giving directions but some times things would be moved without their knowledge either and things would go down hill from there. "
good,"Comfortable environment, friendly management."
good,Since this was a temporary job there wasn't any room for advancement . I did stay on after the first year but I was only getting a few hours a week. It got very busy so quite often we would have to go without breaks and lunches which was difficult when we would get so busy because that's when you really need a break. I liked most of the people I worked with.
good,Don‚Äôt pay good not enough hours to get things done want me to and other to do a lot and not get paid enough job only good if u in school but not if U want to make some money and  Provide for your family
good,"As you can imagine, being hired at Party City right before halloween could be as overwhelming as it sounds. However as chaotic and intense it got, it was fun for the most part. To keep the fun energy up and intensity level down, my coworkers and I would all dress up and entertain each other when we weren't helping customers."
good,"The managers had no sense of what was going on most weeks, hours were never consistent and they hired more people than they had hours for. There were not very many ways to move up unless you were with the company for a very long time. It was a difficult place to work when there was a lot to do because we never had enough people working at one time but there were never any hours to bring in more people. It was not a very organized store manager wise or product wise."
good,The culture was very harsh and uninviting to new employees coming in. The upper management secluded themselves and rarely interacted with lower level employees. No opportunities for advancement presented themselves.
good,We got to learn many things while working for Party City. On a scale from 1 - 10 Party City ranks a 6 1/2. I was surrounded by staff that worked well together.
good,"It was really rushed all the time, specially with halloween coming up. The lines were long and the registers were old and slow. A supervises was needed all the time at registers to approved certain items so they could ring up. Managers were rude at times."
good,"I didn't mind working there too much, but management could have been better. For the most part, everyone was cordial to each other, but no one went out of their way to make me feel comfortable, which I didn't expect but it would have been nice from a manager at least."
good,At first the company was a fun and creating company to work with. The upper managements were nice and caring but as the company grew the level of caring and employees focus was shifted to how much can a store produce.
good,"I mean, it‚Äôs party city. Nothing great, but nothing terrible. Pay isn‚Äôt great but the jobs are easy, managers were nice and pretty funny when I worked there. Overall I‚Äôd say try to find something better, but it‚Äôs not the worst place to work."
good,i worked there part time to learn retail. and was let go early and the conditions were ok they weren't the greatest. they let the one i worked at go way down hill.
good,"I always enjoyed going into work and filling and making balloon orders. Helping people find halloween costumes and accessories."
good,I don't believe that I was treated fairly as far as given the same amount of hours as the rest of the part timers.  I did like what I was doing but not given sufficient work days.
good,"Fast paced and stressful, but keeps things interesting"
good,Not enough hours can be very slow somedays. The prices for some items are way too high that caused customers to take it out on the employers. A lot of balloon orders
good,"I liked working here at the beginning because the pay and the hours were good, but then it just turned into something that I've come to actually hate."
good,"The management team at the location I worked was all over the board for anything.  One was great, one was mediocre, one was not great.  I had an ambivalent experience at the location, only because a couple people made it worth being there while one person could ruin my day.  "
good,I was only a temporary worker for the holiday. My main job was Sales Associate which meant I cleaned the store and kept everything stocked on the shelves for the customers.
good,"Not a team. you work mainly on your own with high school kids who do not care about their job. They do the minimum, and you will cover the store by yourself.  you will work long hours, and they will claim to work with your schedule, when they really wont."
good,Party City is a good place to work. It teaches you how to deal with customers and how to think on your feet. Party City is very fast pace during the months of September and October.
good,Great work place for a first job . Wonderful employees and management. Always flexible hours which was great for me because I have children . Non stressful job
good,"You work far too much for the money you make, the management is a joke and the customers are always flustered and difficult. The hours during Graduation season are sometimes 5 AM-3pm it's ridiculous."
good,"As a sales associate you mostly spend your time on the register. You have to greet every customer that comes in. Talk to customers. Help them choose balloons and blow them up if they want them or place balloon orders for later pick up. If your on the floor you might have to put away returns, organize the merchandise, clean  up the store, pack out the new merchandise, help customers. After helping so many customers I could probably be a party planner because I have helped in many decisions for what decorations would be the best and gave people many ideas."
good,"Overall working at Party City, I learned how to deal with disrespectful customers, also learned how to multi task by helping a customer, and rearranging the stores merchandise. My experience working at Party City I believe the hardest part of the job was to do returns, which was placing items in their exact place; also cleaning up after customers mess."
good,"I would arrive to work; typically on weekends and certain weekdays, mostly opening the store or working second shift. I would sometime have to go in an hour earlier to prepare and confirm balloon orders. I would work the register, answer phones, blow up balloons, and I various other roles as well. I would clean the store, close, and organize."
good,"Its ok job. But after while your hands will start to hurt form all the balloons you have tied "
good,The company has great opportunity to grow. It has a large selection of party goods and really no competition. Struggles lie in managing limited payroll versus high work load expectations.
good,working the registers and helping costumers find items around the store is a typical day. the hardest part of the job is making sure you have all the little details down for the banners and balloon orders. really working with the employees is the best part its like a big family.
good,"I worked there as my 1st retail experience which was fine, however, the office culture at my particular location wasn't the best and their dependence on high-turnover caused improvements for employees to happen at a slow pace. Not bad to gain work experience but I couldn't see working there as full-time or as managerial staff."
good,Loved being able to help Customers (mostly the kids) pick out their costumes and see how excited they are. Good place to work other than the managers.
good,"Store manager is rude and unprofessional to both staff and customers. Many employees and managers have quit due to this fact. Customers complain to corporate constantly yet nothing is done, because she has so many years with the company."
good,"it was a seasonal job."
good,It started out fun and everyday seemed like it flew by but eventually dulled out and got boring. Only got paid $8 an hour and 30% discount also only got 20 hours or less a week. It was a good experience but I wouldn‚Äôt go back.
good,The job itself was fine. The manager had no noticeable experience that made everything difficult.Most of they employees were high school students and did not care about the job. I was one of the more serious workers and was looked over the most. This was a very frustrating job.
good,"you must stock the merchandise, keep the store clean,always  help customers and we had fun but we also had real work to accomplish during our shifts. I enjoyed my job and co workers"
good,There isn't much to do except keep the store clean. Cusomers are the only difficult part because of the area in which I worked. The staff gets along really well and that makes everyone more efficient.
good,"answered all calls and inquires,  greeted customers and radio in for items i n stock, cleaned all isles and restocked/ moved items to and from the back ."
good,I've learned a lot about working retail and the hardest part is probably just standing on my feet for so long. Customers have a lot of fun in our store and that is probably one of the best things about working there. The flexibility is decent considering there aren't enough people hired to cover shifts all of the time.
good,OK for seasonal job they they lay you off when the season ends and the pay is minimum no benefits and they dont schedule you ahead you know the week of so hard to plan stuff.
good,required long hours. got discount on free costumes but the pay was little for all the work we did which included stocking a whole aisle by scratch. great first work experience but would not work their again.
good,It was a fun place to work at cause you can see the different types of item they had while picking the supervisor were very friendly wouldn't mind working there again
good,"fun environment"
good,Party city is good company just had bad management people abused there management powers regular associates did there work for them was ok working there just don't like the people working there.
good,"weak management and coworkers are lazy"
good,"Management was too laid back."
good,"A friendly environment the majority of the time, however a lack of communication in management and a lack of drive from your peers will often lead you to feel frustrated and in a frenzy to complete necessary tasks."
good,"a. Morning Shifts were productive with few coworkers. Around 10 o'clock we would start to see more laid back employees showing up. This was especially true closer to Halloween as management began hiring more young workers for seasonal jobs."
good,"I loved my job at Party City, the original manager, staff, the job itself, and of course our customers. I have learned to grow with my leadership skills and grow within a company. "
good,"Enjoyed working with most of the staff that is currently there, almost like you're working with an extended family. Great people to work with to help make the time fly while you're working."
good,"A typical work day is blowing up balloons, keeping eyes on the register and stocking the shelves. At the end of the night everything must be straightened with re-shops done. I have learned how to blow up balloons along with quickly and efficiently taking care of each customer since you are the first and last person they see. The management is ok, but co-workers will help train you and help you out with questions. The hardest part of this job is learning time management to make sure all tasks get done before the busy time hits. The part I most enjoyed about this job was dressing up for Halloween and blowing up balloons."
good,A typical day at party city would be blowing up balloons and caring for the customer when needed most days we work freight and just stock up items on the floor because when busy they can go quickly.
good,"its a okay place to work.Most of the time it could be a really fun place, a caring place, but at time not a far place. Very hard to move up in the comp."
good,"A typical day as a sales associate involves running the sales floor independently or with little assistance, all while answering phone calls, correctly stocking freight throughout store and top / down stocking when needed, creating displays based upon plan-o-gram and filling area, and also performing usual cashier tasks such as checking guests out and bagging items. In this job, I learned how to multi-task very strategically and more efficiently than before, due to the fact that management would only schedule one or two people per shift and have little involvement with store operation. Other than handling unhappy customers, management (and lack of) is what made the job difficult creating a very stressful, lifeless and unorganized environment. My favorite part of this job is the daily interaction with balloons, and having artistic freedom in color/design arrangements."
good,"Party City was all right; not great, but not horrible, either. I was a Front End Supervisor, which meant managing the register area and keeping an eye on balloons and phone orders(and coaching bewildered high school employees). Black top and khakis was the extent of dress code. Pay was unimpressive but still minimum wage or higher. Shifts of more than 5 hours had a 30 minute break."
good,"Party City was my first job. So I had quite a bit to learn but it didn't take long at all. I am a very fast learner and a great listener. Party City was a fun and outgoing job. I had new customers coming in everyday looking for something different, I learned quickly where everything was at in the store. I also was the cashier, so i had to learn how count money quick and also right."
good,"Party city was a fun work environment, however the management team was disrespectful at times, disorganized, and irresponsible. They don't know how to run a proper team, they may be one of the best stores right now but without the loyalty of the sales associates the store would fall apart."
good,"My typical day at work was dealing with cash and customers, the management wasn't understanding.Co-workers were amazingly fun. The hard part of this job was the Halloween Rush and most enjoying was meeting new people"
good,"the workload is alot but easy.. alot to do in such little hours. alot of labor work, no benefits besides empolyee discount"
good,"A typical day at Party City consists of hundreds of balloons, freight, and hundred of customers looking for party supplies. While working at Party City I have learned that patience and how to multi task in a fast pace environment. My co-workers and managers have to be the best of them all. They are all respectful of each other and everyone gets along. Everyone is always smiling and personal issues are never brought to work. The hardest part about the job would have to be completing freight while changing around the store's floor plan, but overall it is not a difficult job. I enjoy working at Party City because it is exciting to see how excited children are when picking out costumes or supplies for their birthday."
good,"A typical day at work: Customer Service"
good,If you like to be busy then the Halloween season is the best time! It's crazy stressful but also very fun. As long as your team stays on track and works together then things will be ac lot easier.
good,"very friendly work enviornment. polite customers, management can be difficult to work with, but nothing you cannot handle. the hardest part of this job is the cocnstant multi tasking in a fast paced work place. the best part about this job that i loved was doing balloons. taking orders and filling them. awesome work place as well as staff."
good,"Never enough room for the amount of stock that would come in."
good,"It's usually busy on weekends and I blow up hundreds of balloons. During the week it's not as busy unless a holiday is coming up then it's torture. For ex. Halloween, New Years, Valentines Day... Management has been great and very understanding with my school schedule, corporation on the other hand is not so great. I don't get paid enough for everything I do/put up with. My co-workers are awesome. Everything has become second nature to me so nothing at work is difficult."
good,Very slow environment with little to zero room for advancement. Hours are very sketchy and minimal. Seniority does not apply as far as hours and scheduling go.
good,All I will say is that I don't work there anymore. I am not the only one. Many who work there would leave if they had a better opportunity.
good,"While I enjoyed my time working with Party City, I found that the workload exceeded the pay far more than it should for a Halloween employee, which tends to be the busiest time of the year. For 7.93 and hour, employees were expected to not only do the normal work that is done through the year they were payed to do, but had to also try to combine and promote costumes and various accessories, pull costumes from the back, as well as repair and clean up costumes as well. While I am fairly knowledgeable at this task, I found others would struggle to do this, and feel strongly that the compensation was severely under what is usually considered a job for a character artist/ designer with limited resources. Management however was rather nice, and most co- workers were also pleasant."
good,"Very busy except on Sundays,"
good,straightening the sales floor. ringing orders  cleaning and greeting guests fun environment however to many want to be bosses. I am constantly being scheduled one day a week and called in for those scheduled more then calling off.
good,Very unorganized but to be expected since it is a seasonal store.
good,I learned customer service and how to attend a customer . The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers plan their parties. I got along with the co - workers many of times . a typical day at work would be me greeting customers at my register and checking them out or helping customers find there supplies for their parties and taking orders over the phone .
good,"The store manager and the management over all was lacking, the assistant manager took care of mostly everything, it was not fair for them, and we had to take jobs that would set us back from our daily jobs."
good,"Fast pace, fun and professional at times."
good,A typical day at party city depending on the holiday was very fast paced. I enjoyed working with my employees. They made the job even more enjoyable.
good,Party city is a decent job for the time being but not meant to be a long term job. management is poor. most enjoyable is working with my employees. hours are terrible you cant live off what they give you.
good,Working at Halloween City was great until I noticed how it was ran. I found it embarrassing to run around the store yelling for a manager because most of the time they were hard to find or outside taking a smoke break. Almost no one in management would tell their employees if they were doing something wrong or below par. When I was interviewed for the position I made it clear that I can only work as hard as everyone is honest with me. Only one person understood that.
good,It was seasonal position. I enjoyed it the most during Halloween.
good,Overworked. Not a stable workplace. Management needs revamping. Too much pressure on employees.
good,"I understood what I had to do but I was too shy and nervous. I assisted customer find what they wanted but there are customer that like having talk which was extremely hard for me. My typical day at work was take customer's order and get those orders completed two hours before the due time. Restock items that are about to finish and keep the balloon counter clean. When instructed to an aisle, I help customers find what they need and keep my aisle clean. Their were some co-workers that talked to me and I to them. My most challenging part of the job was communicating with customers and what I enjoy in this job was the holidays, especially; Halloween was very full but exciting. On Halloween I wore fairy wings, assisted customer and help my co-worker at the stock room. What I didn't like about the job was that my purse was stolen and that I was always sent to the balloon counter. I didn't learn to use the cash register, stocking, and other sale associate duties."
good,"Remodel experience, sales, customer service, stocking, etc. Worked hard, minimum wage."
good,"I was a ""Halloween hire"" and saw the busiest time of year for Party City. The location had hired about 20 people just to cover the rush, and so it was a challenge to build any kind of working relationship when nobody knew what they were doing or even what everyone's names were. I'm eternally grateful for nametags. Managers were obviously stressed out over how busy it was - there were times when you couldn't move three feet without having to dodge four people - and they passed the stress on to the new employees. One manager kept hinting that three of the new hires would be chosen to stay after Halloween, which added even more stress. Add to that the extremely limited training and emphasis on sales, and this job was more stressful than it was worth. "
good,"I got along great with my co-workers and we were always able to get tasks done as a team with little to no conflict.  Although I enjoyed the people I worked with, management was unprofessional and there was no communication occurring between the higher-ups.  Balloons were both the best and worst part of the job because it was very time consuming yet you really can't hate what balloons represent - fun.  Work usually consisted of cashiering, blowing up balloons, helping customers with invitations, ribbons, etc, and keeping the store organized.  My co-workers were always caring and friendly but management could be a little aloof at times and overbearing at others.  It really lacked consistency and order when it came to management.  I learned a lot about being a supervisor and having your co-workers respect you while still being their superior."
good,Decent place to work but not the best career choice. Have been employed there for going on 5 years and have not been provided with a chance for advancment wtihin the company. Salary has incresed by less than $1 in five years.
good,Seasonal position rang people up on the register also put things that people returned back on the shelf
good,"A typical day of work would include stocking, ringing up customers, and cleaning. I learned how to make balloon bouquets, and how to plan parties. Management and policies changed hands several times in the last few months - we went from being Factory Card and Party to Party City and many policies procedures changed with the new managers as well. Most of my co-workers were friendly and enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of the job not having a set schedule and attempting to work around a retail schedule in order for me to fulfill my community activities and responsibilities I have at my other job and nonprofit organizations I work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was relating with the customers."
good,Party City is a good place to work for those starting out in the workforce
good,"although its a party store there is not much to celebrate, they don't give you birthday pay. and your forced to work through every holiday. you have to deal with pesky customers who are often annoying and pushy. and the stores security sucks!"
good,"i like Halloween, so when i was able to work at Halloween city, my passion for it came out and made this job and enjoyable one"
good,Seasonal position for Halloween. worked mostly in the stock room getting costumes for customer.
good,"Customer Service , Suggestive Sales , Order Pulling, Stocking"
good,"I only worked at Party City for the month of Halloween, but while I was there, the staff was really fun. However, customers were not always happy with prices and the lack of preparation this certain Party City had. Managers showed favoritism and made other new staff feel left out."
good,"I can't say much since they hired me in at the end of the season. My experience there was great, the employees and the environment was friendly and fun."
good,"I stayed as long as I did (8 yrs) because of the manager I had and employees I worked with.  As far as the Company they don't give a care about their employees if they did they would treat them better and the pay raises would be better then 5 cent a hour.  I always worked to where companies respected their employees for their performance and loyalty to the company, not Party CCiyyCity. they don't care at a"
good,"Though I was a seasonal employee, I felt more as someone who was a volunteer rather than one of their employees and was treated as such, I was also not informed if I was let go, I had to call them"
good,Temporary position which provided me with warehouse experience.  Enjoyed the work and the people.  Would have love to stay on as an employee of the company.
good,"Working here was nice the demand in season is high so fast pace environment, it was a friendly atmosphere. the task were easy and not hard. balloons were the hardest thing"
good,Task service balance can be difficult. Each day is slightly different and you need to change directions daily. Low payroll hours to meet budgets and providing high service levels is the most challenging .
good,The work was not very difficult but the management team did not support or stick up for their employees. When you worked incredibly hard it went unnoticed but once you stopped going above and beyond they reprimanded you.
good,It‚Äôs a good job while your in high school that‚Äôs why I liked it then because they‚Äôre very understanding with school and want you to be on top of your grades but once your out of school there‚Äôs not too many opportunities there
good,Overall decent place to work a total change in company's outlook over last couple of years was for the best but was at times hard to manage and a cause for stress.
good,"The work environment is very active and fun throughout the day as a sales associate. Co-workers are easy to get along with, but that same cooperation cannot be promised with management, who may treat sales associates fairly or poorly. Typical days at work consist of cleaning and organizing the store, stocking and restocking, and assisting customers with requests. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with customers, who may be either friendly or hostile outside of your control. The most enjoyable part of the job, however, would be managing the store and assisting customers with requests, as their gratitude brings a positive aura to the workplace."
good,"Very chill environment and great as an entry level store position. Filling balloons is a fun skill I picked up and for the most part my managers were fun-loving people. I just didn't see much opportunity for advancement and I began to hate Halloween since every Halloween is a hellish experience and customers really show their dark sides. Get to learn the hardest aspects of customer service during the month of October and throughout the rest of the year, the store is a relatively relaxed place to be."
good,great first job but don't make a career out of it. company gives penny raises and DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU. your store coworkers might care for you but the company (corporate) does not care. you are disposable to them.
good,Party City was a good first job for me. I‚Äôm ready for something new so that I can begin a new journey with new experiences! Retail is something I know by heart and would love something that works in retail as well!
good,With every holiday the store had to change thing around so remembering everything was a challenge. The management was stressed out on certain  seasons. Also lots of hard labor.
good,"at the time I was working the job was dealing with a lot of internal issues that effected the workers more than not. Management seemed to have a lot of inconsistency, and that effected a lot of the work ethic throughout the store. employess were fun and comfortable to work with, but the stress of the company wasn't worth it."
good,"Would walk around the store fronting items, stock shelves and clean up the store. I would also assist customers with merchandise and balloons. I learnt how to deal with customers and other co workers."
good,I worked there for 13 years and had a lot of fun learning everything. I opened and closed the store. I had the title of a team leader and did everything the assistant manager did. I trained new staff and made daily deposits to the bank and did receiving and  inventory and unloaded trucks and checked in the merchandise and completed balloon orders and ordered supplies for the store and completed planagrams and cashiering and special ordering invite and napkins for all occasions. The hardest part of the job was being used by management and being treated unfair by the manager
good,"Fast paced environment,  no discrimination , equal opportunity . Flexible schedule . Learning environment.  Friendly staff , ok management . Not enough Days"
good,"A typical day at work: working cash register, blowing up and assembling balloon bouquets, providing customer service, inventory control, cleaning store. I learned to interact with customers and help them solve their problems whenever one was encountered. The management was pretty good and I enjoyed the company of all of my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was during each holiday because it would always get extremely busy, but it made time fly by."
good,I enjoyed working here! There was a lot of energy and diversity. Something or someone was always being celebrated. Everyone was so helpful despite the constant pace of work!!
good,"Management is a bit difficult to work with half the time. Very little opportunity to advance/get promoted. Customers can be difficult, rude as expected in retail environment. Corporate expects to much of its employees like there is only so much we can get done. Lack of Helium in the USA is causing several customers to be cranky and have an attitude with employees. Wouldn't recommend to friends to work at, but its okay as a first job for high school students. Hours are great during Graduation and Halloween season, but off season hours are low."
good,"Definitely a job to start in High school. Nothing more nothing less to be honest. Do your time and save up what ever you can. if offered a position to move up then take it. Take whatever is offered for experience, do your time for commitment and experience and move on as soon as possible."
good,"Worked during Halloween, so it was very demanding. While the work was easy, the poor management made things very difficult. Good first job but not a career choice for some. There wasn't enough hours for most people and even in the Halloween season we were very short staffed."
good,Party city was my first job and so far for the time that I‚Äôve been working there I‚Äôve love it and I haven‚Äôt had any problems. A typical day at work starts off slows and then speeds up as the day goes by .
good,"It was a fun environment to work in, I loved helping customers create their own looks and helping them locate an item. BUT the management was very rude and too advantage of their power. when a customer needed help over the phone, the managers would tell us to put them on hold and never pick up."
good,As a seasonal position it was okay nothing special kinda over worked and under paid. Job would be good for a beginner worker. If doing seasonal work try to get there as soon as the season starts to learn the ropes because coming in close to Halloween is like getting thrown to the wolves.
good,"Low stress job but very poor management, no room for advancement and a lot restructuring happening in the company. Also low pay offered and benefits aren't great."
good,"It could be a good place to start and get experience for your resume, but I do not trust this company at all. As a contract employee, I had three different bosses within my same department within 5 months which caused a lot of inconsistency in training and development. There is no formal training, only shadowing style learning. They will not give you a lesson plan structure such as ""today is about image tools. Tomorrow is about Data Management"". If you do not find yourself to be a vocal person and willing to speak up if you have questions, you will not survive here. "
good,"working for party city was fun, friendly,relax, I will recommend them to someone but mangers had to show respect too. Also I love meeting need people."
good,"I worked full time Monday through Friday and the management treat me really nice since I just turned 18 I noticed they did not give me a lot of responsibility and I was curious to learn more, due to that I wanted to leave."
good,"Most of the work I did for Party City was during the Halloween seasonal rush. There are usually plenty of hours to go around during that time, and it's a fairly low pressure work environment though there is a lot of work to be done."
good,Decent place to work. Needed more employees with work ethics. District manager was very knowledgable oh their job and able to clearify any and all questions we had at our store
good,"A typical day consisted of zoning the aisles, blowing up balloons and being on the register majority of the time."
good,i was a teen working here and the night manager wasn't the best but you had to deal with it. working there is nice but like most places there will be people there that makes work place hard and he was one of them.
good,"I had a fine time working there, payment was sufficient while I lived with my mom. I hear corporate has cut hours leaving few workers at a time which is sad to me because I loved working there purely for the family I made through my coworkers"
good,Working for Party City was cool instarted working there when i was 18. It helped me save money for my first car. This job was one of my first jobs actually.
good,"It was fun during the holidays as we got to dress up and really decorate the place. However, the management had many flaws. the owner was harsh and extremely demanding to the point that everyone was afraid when he came in. the management team was a mess with some good and determined managers and mostly lazy and lack luster work ethics. overall id say its only good for a short term job or a summer job for young adults in college."
good,"Typical day: paperwork, balloons, adjusting/setting/resetting new sets for the store"
good,"Management within the overall corporation expected too much to get done without giving enough hours for such, and the pay hardly increased - in nearly four years I only received $1.80 total increase in my wage from what I started at and what I left at - and that was after a promotion two years ago - I still was not even making $10/hour being a member of management in my store."
good,The job it's self was easy enough but the drama between the employees and from the job  and customers was enough to make the little pay and little hours enough not to come back to.
good,"Typical day at work would include picking orders and interacting with customers. Stocking product and building display stands. I learned how to build display stands, pull orders for customers, and be more open to customers. Management was very straight forward. Workplace/environment was very fun and social. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to talk to and interact with different people, and helping other team members with tasks."
good,"The environment at the Party City I worked at was overall pleasant, but the compensation for the work done by associates is close to criminal. It was a learning opportunity I am thankful for, but now desire a more challenging and fulfilling work experience."
good,"Atmosphere is tense, work load is too much for most to handle.  Fast paced work minimum supervision. Schedule changes do happen but very often.  Overall it's allot to do for only a 8 hour shift."
good,I found myself constantly working and doing something throughout my shift. If all my work was done I would then move on to help out other workers. Customers can be a bit hard to work with but that is any retail job. Recent management was not the best but the assistant managers I had no problem with. The hardest part about the job is during the Halloween season in which you are constantly on the move and helping customers. Personally I loved that part of the job as I was kept active which made me a bit more healthier and time can fly by when I was that busy.
good,"If you can stand for hours on end with no problem, cope with hearing the same songs every day, and repetition doesn't bother you then you'll be fine. My managers were pretty bland but mature and always on top of things. Customers never were a problem either."
good,Being that this was my first job I learned how to work a cash register. I had so much fun everyone working was welcoming and nice. It‚Äôs a party store so of course the environment was fresh and upbeat it made you want to buy stuff just because. The hardest part but I enjoyed was the rush you had to do everything quick paced and a lot of tasks at one time. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers which i love to do because i‚Äôm a sociable person. Some managers were mean at times and some were fun!
good,"Iparty was bought out in 2013 and turned into Party city where many policies changed in a better way, however so did the prices. Good job for a high schooler, however low paying."
good,"Having fun and competant coworkers can really improve the quality of life for working at Party City, and most of the time it is a very laid back job. "
good,"Party City started off as a great place, but quickly went down hill. They start off with giving you ample hours to run the building, but quickly remove them to cover budgets. When you only give your stores hours to have 4 people on at any given time it makes it difficult to get things done. When companies just have the 'get it done' mentality, it makes it hard to think that they have they're employees best interest in mind above there own."
good,"Overall, it was a good job!! Very relaxed most of the time, but can get pretty busy. Especially at Halloween time! Great first job. And doing balloons is fun"
good,"Halloween City is fun because it's a holiday store and we all love to ""dress up'! "
good,Fast paced and there‚Äôs always something to do. You have to stay focused and calm with customers & have give them a fun and friendly experience so they will want to come back!
good,"Party City was my first job and has taught me how to handle the public. It's not always easy, but I learned a lot from Party City. Helping customers plan a party was always fun too."
good,"I was mostly stuck on the till even when I asked to switch between the floor and till. (I found that I was very emotionally drained after 8 hours of being a cashier, however a bit of variety keeps me engaged). I had some decent co-workers, and I enjoyed the interaction. Only thing i was unsure about was how to use my discount :P"
good,"working at party city is always fun. managment is amazing and team members are bearable. it gets busy and stressful but you cant let it overpower you. overall a decent place to work, i just wish i had gotten more hours"
good,the only problem i had with party city is that i was there so long and i trained a lot of people to do the same job that i was doing but they would always promote the people i trained and would never promote me now i have no problem with that but the people they would promote over me didn't know how to do the operations they were doing when they got promoted so maybe they didn't like me i don't know but they have to choose better with who they promote
good,"I enjoyed my job at Party City, it was a very fast pace job, interacted with customers on a daily basic. Must be able to blow up balloons and arrange them. It's good to have knowledge of Halloween as they are one of the biggest Halloween retail stores to sell costumes and props. Pay wasn't very good, but they were very accomateding with my schedule at the time,I had 3 young children all in daycare."
good,"I began working at Party City as my first job ever. I loved the other employees and how relaxed they were, but the management did close to nothing to guide me. They didn't communicate to me how to clock in and clock out, how to set up my banking with them and more. I often asked my co employees how to do things, and they'd happily help. When I left, I never got sent a check or deposit fo my work. I didn't get paid until 2 years later, after making calls after calls to the corporation."
good,I really enjoyed working with Party City especially during Halloween. That was the busiest but most amazing time to work there. I actually worked 2 jobs while I worked at Party City. I wouldn't have left there if they could have worked around my full time jobs schedule.
good,A typical day at work is helping customers find what they need and restocking the shelves. I learned about inventor management. Management at this store had a negative interaction with many of the employees causing an atmosphere of disorganization and confusion. The hardest part of the job was the disorganization but the best part was helping little kids find which costume they wanted.
good,"Decent place to work ,felixable schedule and work hours , comfortable atmosphere, easy work load . decent managment. I learned that working in a party store you have to make sure orders and everything are put together according to how the customer wants it ."
good,This place is a great place to work for someone that's in high school or as a summer job! Party City works with your schedule and pays more than minimum wage.
good,"Good place to get started as a first job, constantly changing holidays keep the work coming, good chance for advancement, but pay does not match responsibilities you get."
good,"The job is a basic part-time seasonal job, management is like any corporate chain, but the shuffle of in-store management or mismanagement is what causes the store to suffer. I wouldn't return unless asked and only on a temporary basis."
good,it was fun to work there. great staff. my tasks where pretty fun got to work with a lot of fun people great store. really fun at Halloween going to get costumers costumes.
good,I think if management helped out with the job duties more it would be a lot smoother place to work. I learned that celebrations cost a lot of money and if people do not come to work as scheduled it causes a lot of stress on the other workers.
good,"A lot of my time there was spent meandering through the store to see if customers needed help or if anything needed to be straightened. A lot of busy work and certainly nothing of any larger value. But for a young person in college, the work atmosphere was pretty light except for the Halloween season."
good,Halloween time you will get 30+ hours a week and after that they will let people go and the hours will then be minimal. The store is more boring when it's not Halloween.
good,"It is a fun place to work at, but very little benefits and little pay. It gets pretty hectic around halloween time. The only benefits that you get from there I would say is the discounts."
good,Great place as a first job but not a permanent place to pay the bills. The company lacks a lot of love and involvement with there stores. Don't except much going in.
good,This is a best for seasonal workers who want extra money or want to built a stronger resume. Usually college students work and management is relax as long as you help out.
good,"Working for Party City I learned how to work multiple job roles in order to properly serve customers. However, I wish the position became full-time and paid better."
good,"Halloween is the best time to work at Party City. Very fast paced busy retail store. Great benefits and discounts. email coupons when you give your email address at checkout."
good,Worked as an associate for three seasons at Halloween City a spin off of party city. final year (4th) asked for assistant manager position.Was given position and basically thrown to the wolves without much upper management support.
good,I learned more about customer service in a very fast paced environment. The hardest part about the job was dealing with the stress of Halloween season as well as making customers happy.
good,Halloween in the busiest time of the year for Party City. It was a seasonal job. It was alright. The people I worked with for the most part were friendly.
good,ok place to work.  Management is not bad.  Opportunities for advancement not so much.  Given that I was laid off I really don't have many great things to say about the company.
good,"A typical day would be me checking on what task or area i'm working ,and help out customers find what they are looking for. Clean and organize shelves, place returned items back to original spots. learned many different terms and how to find and know which product is supposed to go. Management was great, easy to talk to and approachable. Hardest part was keeping up with customers request for costumes. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with a mixed aged group."
good,"When i got hired i was 17 and, as far as i'm aware needed a work permit from my school, which they did not ask for. another negative is when i stopped working, I was never called to say that they were letting me go they just stopped scheduling me."
good,"the costumes were racist caricatures, the managers were intimidating when they weren't unobservant, and the hours were impossible to pin down. Money is money, but honestly the people there deserved better."
good,"I worked for Party City for 6 years (off and on) and over the years management has got worst. Now don't get me right, its a nice place to shop but when it come to employee they would care less if you had a death in the family. When I was an temporary Halloween help the GM of the store would let me know every time I worked that I was only a temp. Now that I'm no longer working there the manager still follow me around the store and watch over me as I'm checking out. And that show how Party City managers has poor people skills but there are some manager that work with you. Maybe the GM just don't trust and like me."
good,"If you want a job that deals with strong nepotism and sexism, then this is the job for you. Working your butt off makes no difference since the managers only promote workers that they're close friends with and don't take account to productivity. For the sexism, managers will also assume you can't help with stocking despite proving them otherwise, but who cares since you are a ""weak and fragile woman"" and they supposedly need ""strong men"". Not only that, but the main boss normally has more hours than necessary and spends all the time in the back room barely helping the sales floor. Ridiculous and very toxic management. The environment, however, is fun and (most) coworkers are enjoyable to be around nonetheless."
good,"This job was easy, yet the people were not the best. Manager didn't understand when you needed a day off. Other than that, coworkers were always so nice."
good,"Work is fairly steady. A day would include mostly customer service and product stocking. Management is fair and knowledgeable, but had communication issues when new managers were put into place. Atmosphere was friendly, as almost everyone is easy to get along with."
good,"A great fast pace during Halloween season, the management staff and associates are friendly and helpful. They are flexible with hours when needed and are willing to work around school"
good,The pay is not enough for the work you have to do. It's easy most of the time. But he just pay more if you have more responsibilities. the hours are bad. Only good during halloween
good,"A great place for a first job. Great job for a people person.  a typical day would be placing balloon orders, answering the phone, costumer service, and working as main cashier"
good,"Workload is overwhelming. Loss of management to constantly help other stores. Leaving responsibility on minimal staff. Lack of structure, poor training, staff not held responsible for anything."
good,"Party City was my first job and I was more than thrilled to be kept after the Halloween season. I learned a great deal, but I was never fully content. Managers were petty and tried to get associates to pick sides. No drug testing, so anyone could come in work. Most associates just stopped coming without notice which left dedicated workers like me to fill in unplanned hours. It was very rare to see a worker last more than a month or two, and all the original employees left during my year working there. Admittedly, it is fun there are the perks of a relatively positive environment that children and party-goers frequent. It allowed me opportunities to be creative and help plan events."
good,"On a typical day i would have to walk down the aisle and clean it to make it look presentable to the customers. I would help out any customers with anything. Management wasn't so organized, there was a lot of managers. The environment of the work place was fun, i made friends easily and it felt like a family."
good,"A typical day here, is basically cashiering similar to any other retail store with the exception of balloon orders and inflating the balloons also. The hardest part of the job would be the amount of unreasonable customers you have to talk to, in order to satisfy. Also management isn't that great. Most of the managers are passive aggressive, while one day they can make you feel like family, the nest they are condescending and use their authority to compromise your job. I believe they do not offer full time positions to most of their associates so that they can skip out on offering beni"
good,"This place is okay as a first job. Better than fast food joints and whatnot, but not a place to grow really. I did learn a lot, a lot of the things you learn from your first job. Management at my store used to be good, but it got pretty bad at the end. My co-workers were hit or miss, but my store, and I suspect many stores, employed mostly teenage girls because that is who the job appeals to. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers. The best part was also dealing with customers. It's all about helping people and building relationships. Some people could be quite rude though. It's also a popular place for shoplifters form what I can tell."
good,I was only a seasonal employee for Halloween so it seemed hard at times  but it was fun.Being able to seethe joy and the excitement in kids faces when they find their favorite halloween costume was adorable.
good,"Fun place to work, friendly staff, clean building, productive. However there is some favouritism and some judgments from management and overly strict rules. But you get decent pay with little hours making work/personal life easily manageable."
good,"Co workers are helpful/uplifting energetic "
good,"Each day starts by looking at the schedule for any changes.If there are no changes you go directly to work. It is an easy enviornment to work in. management will help in any way they can to make you be successful. There are no benefits,but overall the work is easy,and the enviorment is positive."
good,I did not work at Party City for long but I was always busy while working there. My co workers were polite to me and to the customers.
good,"Must tolerate standing & walking "
good,They no longer had full time work and only minimum wage. The company's upper management was mediocre. I worked under a franchised PC and there were a million excuses about it. Halloween time is fun but stressful and ALWAYS FULL! The store would always be a WRECK after customer's left for the day.
good,"Working at Party City is not the best, but its good enough if you're looking for something temporary. Hours are terrible, there's no room to advance, and you hardly get any pay raises (at most maybe .15?)  I started back in 2010 at $8.25/hr. The only reason I make $10/hr now is because the government raised the minimum wage. If you're a student or have another part-time job and you're looking for good experience, this job can give you that. But its best to move on to better things as soon as possible."
good,"I loved working at office depot and was very sad to leave (which i did for personal reasons). My favorite day (and most productive day) was always sunday--a few coworkers and i would arrive 3 hours prior to opening and would set the ad for the week, which included deals and savings customers could snag until the next sunday! Also, we would work on planograms and reports in between providing great customer service."
good,"Very bad employee service. Management was horrible, not clean, and stressful. When you come in to work everyone is yelling and forcing you to hurry and clock in, the co-workers were mean and think they know it all."
good,should be more diverse and not so much favoritism needs to be more of a team environment. All should be allowed chance to grow in company based on performance
good,"A pretty basic seasonal retail position.  Wages were fair, though benefits were basically non-existent."
good,"Fun when you are helping customers find costumes, but management is terrible. Plays favorites and has no opportunities for advancement. Low hours and low pay."
good,"Management was often disorganized scheduling balloon orders, counting drawers, although working during seasonal time policies were better enforced. Certain stores like to hire a large staff and only provide less than 10 hours a week to work."
good,"Party City is a fun place to interact with customers and employees on a daily basis. I've learned to multi- task and take on responsibility of being able to juggle customers as well as product. Fellow employees were amazing to work with and very welcoming to me when I first started at that location. I believe there was a lot more management needed but we made it work, the only problem was conflicting management titles had different ways of doing things compared to others.  Halloween was the best part of the job and being able to dress up and interact as much as the customers was a great time."
good,roughness is when we work together to give the best service to all customers to visit us and leave satisfied with their purchases
good,"Typical day at work was fast paced because it was a seasonal job and Halloween was the biggest season for them. Assisting customers in finding the perfect costumes. Calling for the right costumes for the customer if I'm working the picture wall. Or pulling the correct costumes that the picture-wall worker calls for. Then at the end of the night recovering it all from top to bottom. If I opened, I would down stock, making sure everything is full and tidy. Mangers and co-workers were friendly and inviting for the most part. The hardest part would have to be calling for a costume for one customer, waiting for the receiver to check for it, assure you that we have it in the size asked for, and informing us that its out, all while five more customers are also ready to ask for their costumes and some have 3 or 4 different costumes that they want to know about at once. The most enjoyable part who have to be once they find the perfect costume and you help them accessorize it and they keep thanking you because they're excited about it and can't wait for the night of."
good,"the typical day would include customer service, stocking freight, fulfilling balloon orders and helping people plan their events. I learned  how to help people plan parties for specific themes and get the most for their money. The store manager was very helpful, accommodating, and understanding. The supervisors were helpful but not consistent in the treatment of the employees. The hardest part of working for this company was the lack of opportunity to advance or get more hours. The most enjoyable part was helping customers plan for their events and create costumes for halloween."
good,A typical day of work was normal in helping customer with purchase and finding the product they want. Keeping the store clean and free of trash. Placing and restocking products on the self so it can be found in the proper place.
good,"No promotions from within. Hired for job and then left there. Already knew how to run store from previous job. Trained assistants, staff & 60+ temps every Halloween. Constant seasonal changes made it a constant challenge which I enjoyed."
good,"A typical day at Party City is spent tending to customer needs, and completing tasks within the store in order to keep the store running properly. I have learned over the years the importance of listening to exactly what customers need, and how your attitude plays a major role in performing good customer service. In terms of management, I have seen them all, great managers and not so good managers but through it all I have learned that having a good manager that understands his or her staff, as well as treats staff members fairly is extremely beneficial for the company and or franchise as a whole. The hardest part of my job is the labour intensive times such as merchandising, because it is constantly changing due to the fact that it is a seasonal store. In working over the years I can honestly say my most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers with their needs, whether that be making a balloon arrangement for a two year old, to putting a smile on a customers face who leaves happy and satisfied."
good,"A typical day includes running around like a madman trying to get everything done in as little time as possible, helping customers both over the phone and in person, restocking items multiple times, using outdated register equipment, tying balloons in a pre-taught manner and grouping them to order, dealing with miscommunication between team members, faulty radio equipment that there are not enough of for every team member on any given shift, cleaning everything, etc. The worst part of this job was the overbearing store manager and his flighty mood swings. The best part of this job was meeting all those people, both co-worker(even managers from other stores) and the customers. It is a great place to learn how to deal with pressure, how to work efficiently while at a break-neck pace, and how to use a cash register effectively(even with Tax-exempt transactions and old equipment)."
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Party City is that when people come in they are looking to plan a party. Having the party mindset sets this job apart from other retailers in the aspect that parties are meant to be enjoyable. That translates to a happier customer base, which leads to a very positive work environment."
good,"Worked for Party City for 5 years as a store manager.  Advancement opportunities for those that where ""yes"" men.  Performance metrics changed each year and things that were not store controllable were often included in yearly reviews.  Opened a store and as payroll was not allocated for the process, it affected the profitability of the store which resulted in me losing bonus at year end.  "
good,"Working at Party was a very memorable experience. I was hired as a temporary worker during the Halloween season and they kept me as a permanent worker. I made new and amazing friends. Going into work was never hard because everyone worked so well together. Everyone was friends, even the managers. The managers had great attitudes and made sure to maintain a positive work environment, while maintaining their professionalism. My only complaint was the we were overworked all the time. We would either get too many hours and one day off, and still be called in to work on that day off, and be doing a crazy amount of work, or we would only get at the most 5 hours a week for weeks at a time."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of maintaining the store."
good,"Great group of people to work with in an energetic, fun atmosphere. Dedicated workers willing to help and provide support when needed."
good,"It can be a good chance to get retail experience but don't think you can just sit on your but, it's hard work and the manager's expect you to work not play. The pay and hour's are not the best why it's better if this is your first job or a student because not a lot hour's and it wont support a family. The co worker's are amazing made some life long friend's so expect caring managers just do the work and you'll be fine."
good,I really enjoy my job at Party City. The store changes as the holidays do so there is always something new to look forward to. My management staff is flexible and easy to work with.
good,I would come in after school and typically work 4 hours. I learned just the basics of working hard and as a team. Management changed 3 times in les than a year that I was there. My coworkers were all my age at the time and it made me comfortable and mad work fun.The hardest part of the job was working weekdays after school and football practice. the most enjoyable part was the people I met and worked with and always having different assingments.
good,"Seasonal Employment. Fun ""out of the box"" job, with fun co-workers. Higher management were good and professional, but the lower management seemed to be untrained & sometimes even unqualified. My co-workers were fun and very enjoyable to be around! The hardest part of the job was the constant straightening up we had to do. Customers would pick up and look at or play with items, and then just put the item down anywhere in the store. We had to walk around almost on a constant basis and put the relocated items back where they belonged. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to dress up in different Halloween costumes every day! As a team we would plan a theme and all dress up a like. Halloween City really was an enjoyable place to be employed."
good,This is a very hands on retailer and most of time management is doing the work. There are not enough hours without overusing payroll to have a staff who can help.
good,"I absolutely loved working at party city, as sales person i loved it, however, from an outside-the-work perspective, the management was absolutely ridiculous. The managers did not want us talking to customers, only pumping them out of the door with as much stuff as they can carry and as fast as possible, as a salesman, i  understand, but that does not make the customer want to come back. I enjoyed talking to them about what parties they were planning and making sure they got exactly what they wanted, i got yelled at for it often by my managers."
good,"Corporate info is a bit dodgy at times, with a lot of issues in their instructions, but at the store level, communication is pretty good. It can be a fun work environment with the right crew, but a lot of young hires who do not understand that a job means you have to do the work can make it challenging."
good,Opportunity to learn and acquire merchandising skills. Enjoyed coaching and training sales associates.
good,"On a typical day at work, a person could be scheduled to work for 4 hours and not leave until after they've reached 6 or 7 hours with no breaks. I learned that attendance really affects the people one works with after several of my co-workers arrived anywhere from an hour to 2 hours late. The management at the store I worked were very laid back and easy going, but sometimes at the wrong times, like when discipline should have been in order. My co-workers were not very serious about their jobs. They were nice, but they slacked off a lot and put all the work on the new people coming into the company. The hardest part of the job had to have been working with people that didn't want to really work. It became more of an inconvenience than a pleasure working there. I was called in on my days off and my job was threatened numerous times when I would refuse going in on days off or if I had doctor visits that were approved before hand. I have to say that I did enjoy being able to dress up at work for the holidays and met many new interesting people (even made quite a few tips because of my attitude and because I talked to and gave advice to some)."
good,"I would come in at 9 make sure everything is straight and clean"
good,"You got to decorate the merchandise to make it look more appealing to customers and to also show them how it worked. I was cashier, but you have to be VERY fast seeing as you're handling their transactions AND bagging."
good,"At Halloween City (temporary seasonal job) , it was a friendly and fun place to work every day. I learned that understanding customer service is very important to be successful on the job. As part of the management team overall we were very positive to staff. The co-workers were very nice, and they were friendly. The hardest part on the job was that I wish that I could have caught all the thieves in store, but unfortunately, that was not the case. The most enjoyable parts to the job were being able to stay happy and have fun while being at work."
good,"fun place to work but there is no security on the premises, which put associates safety at risk"
good,Helped customers with costumes. My co-worker were great people to work with. The hardest part was it was seasonal and time demanding for managers.
good,too bad they only really BOOM in business during Halloween ... after that store is pretty slow and don't have much hours to give. pretty much a seasonal position
good,It was fun to work here but it was only temporary and I didn't stay long enough to really learn anything that I did not already know. It did teach me a little bit about how to process orders.
good,"Work would begin as early as 7am if stocking or important things were to be done. Cash and balloons were often busiest during the days but slowed down in the evening. I learned how to work cash, do balloon orders, as well as familiarize myself with plan-o-grams (grid plan outlines for the store and each section) and ensuring the store was in order and neat as well and most importantly, great customer service. The hardest part of the job was perhaps only during halloween season which gets very crowded and extremely busy. My co-workers were always fun and energetic. Management at the store however, kept changing often, making it difficult and confusing sometimes with hours and shifts and how they were dealt with and handed out."
good,"typical day included cleaning the store , assisting customers , picking costumes."
good,"Normal retail. Facing, stocking, ordering, pricing."
good,"Fun, creative, fast-paced, exciting. Got to help people find their costumes & wear Halloween accessories at work."
good,"For management it is expected to work very long hours daily and weekly(no overtime).  Very task heavy.  Team and customers are great and fun.  What do you expect, it's a PARTY store.  lol"
good,"A typical day for me was a 9 hour shift having many duties such as operating a register, janitorial work, stocking, writing schedules, verifying deposits, opening/closing the store & much more. Sadly the management in this company was also a bad experience for me as the General Manager was condescending & harassed much of the staff. The hardest part of the job was working with him. The most enjoyable part was working with the staff as I had a good relationship with just about all of them."
good,"The job was really fun, even with low pay and low hours. great start job right out of Highvschool, or still in High School."
good,"Meeting new people, blowing balloons, stocking"
good,I typically work either as a cashier or a stockperson or store organizer. I also help locate products they are looking for and often search the computer system to check on these.
good,"The company itself is organized, kind, and a fun environment to work in. However, the management at the location I worked at was less than capable. The District manager had failed all of the previous locations he had opened, and had us on the same track. He was extremely unorganized, and every single employee could see he was over his head. In a month and a half, he barely came in enough to add up to a normal day's work. He set up the plans wrong, which meant we organized products wrong, and in the three days before opening day, we had to not only attempt to stock 3 whole pallets of new merchandise; We also had to RE organize the old and put it in entirely different areas of the store. No signs were put up, floors weren't cleaned, and none of us [Not even the two hired on as Manager/Assistant Manager] were schooled in how to use the registers or count at the end of the day. All of it was guesswork. Unfortunately, DUE to this disorganization, I was terminated as a product of management's failure to communicate with each other and remain organized. On the day of opening, the day before scheduling [Saturday], I personally took aside each of the three managers [Assistant, manager, and the one above him] and notified them that, because of my military spouse's new hours as of the following Monday, I would no longer be able to work Monday through Thursday. But I was available any hours Friday through Sunday, THE busiest days. They all said okay, and the Store Manager even wrote down the information and put it by the store computer. The next day, scheduling, they had apparently scheduled"
good,"Nice place to work for energetic happy individuals. However, the customer service at times is completely rediculous, which for me happens to be the hardest to deal with."
good,just didnt like it. everything was out of wack.the management was rude. the coworkers were lazy. the hardest part of the job was at the end of the day when you had to do the put backs.
good,"Productive and Fun working enviorment., i stocked, used the RF gun to receive the product and also the computer to do audits."
good,"Wonderful place to work if you plan parties as I do because of the discounts. That is the only thing that I enjoyed. there were many safety hazards, employees were transferred to different locations carelessly."
good,"Working for Halloween City was a great experience in learning to manage others, set up and run a store, and how to give excellent customer service. It was, however, an overly stressful experience because of the brief training, vague plan-o-gram instructions, very short time to set up the store, and continuous problems that would arise but weren't immediately fixed from upper management. I did enjoy working in a fun environment of a store that is all about Halloween and I learned a lot about efficient time management, how to give excellent customer service, and what to look for when hiring competent employees."
good,"although this place has no security, it's still a fun place to work. They employees and managers are very funny and friendly, they make the environment less stressful"
good,"I love working with people. Customer service is always number one. Keeping busy with tasks helps the time go by. No standing around allowed. As long as you get your job done in a timely manner, things work smoothly"
good,"I feel that it could be better the manger was truly unprofessional and doesn‚Äôt treat us how he could, but I did love working with the employees and the customers was great."
good,"a typical day , the best part were the workers It was so diverse the worst part was the managers bad attitude , a little rude and impatient I learned Customer Service Skills"
good,"Its an alright place to work at nothing extraordinary really just selling costumes, balloons, candy, party favors, and also sells other seasonal stuff when that season comes around"
good,"Poor work environment a lot of noice. They do not care about your working environment or how you feel. Besides they do not help you at all on your career advancement if there is some courses, classes or conference that can make you sharp on the work you are doing they do not care about it you have to pay out of your pocket, it doesn't matter if it is for the company sake."
good,"The management was nice and I enjoyed my time working their. I worked sales floor as well stocked shelves, and assisted customers. I worked the seasonal position, but they extended my stay for an extra month due to my good work, but did≈Ñt have sufficient hours to keep me on a permenent schedule."
good,"The environment was good, the work was reasonable and the hours and scheduling were really flexible. I was given a lot of projects like restocking, changing store price tags, cleaning, and working cashier to pass the time."
good,I only worked for party city for a small amount of time I liked the work environment but the pay and hours weren't good at all and it was pretty slow most of the time expected when Halloween and New Years came around.
good,"I LOVED working there before because i would help the customers out on what they needed help with,i would talk to them like if i knew them,but when i left not to long ago,it looked like the manager didnt know how to control her store. She would leave everything to her employee's to tend by themselves. No communication what so ever,and hours were horrible. The hardest part of the job was doing EVERYTHING. The most enjoyable was my co-workers and some customers"
good,"I liked both the assistant managers, but when the new store manager took over she was hard to work for. I also ended up making less than someone I trained at Party City. So the wages were not only low, but unfair."
good,"Varies from store to store. Some stores, the employees act and work like a family, other stores not so much. A typical can day can be anywhere from super slow to hectic, but there's always gonna be the same amount of employees working practically no matter what. I have learned a lot from working here, mostly information about balloons that will never be useful to me outside of the workplace. The hardest part of the job is getting through rushes when there's only a manager and a cashier working. The most enjoyable part is getting a firsthand look at some of the ridiculous and fun products we get in stock."
good,"Small store easy to get comfortable in and learn where things are, and simple system for cashiering, restocking, and filling balloons.  Halloween season is very busy."
good,"I would say that this job definitely taught me many things and helped further growth will my skills in retail. Although, the work life at my location had many issues with attitudes between managers to employees and all employees including managers to customers. There was a lot of rules being overlooked and unproductive attitudes towards customers with complaints or issues. There wasn't much training more so just being thrown in and hope you understand along the way yet ridiculed and penalized when things were done incorrectly."
good,"The hours are super flexible as I‚Äôm in college which is really helpful, and the staff is generally pretty friendly. The management is not very trained, kind, but doesn‚Äôt really know much of how to run a company. Cooperate is awful. Does not care about the associates one bit"
good,"A typical day at work included being assigned aisles to manage and take care of for your shift. Followed by being tasked with a certain responsibility for the day which could be changed later including: cash register, storage room, costume wall, balloons, or just simply cleaning up the store. "
good,When I was working at party city it was very laid back and chill not very busy on the weekdays. Weekends got busy in the mornings and as far as management I‚Äôd say it could be better
good,"Typical day at work consists of ; greeting all customers, keeping front end kept up, taking and completing the balloon orders for that day, sometimes unloading freight, recovering, etc.  "
good,Didn‚Äôt really like working there the managers were favoritizing and being unfair the co workers were ok some were actually very lazy the whole experience was bad but I gained a lot of customer expectations
good,"Overall this is an OK place to work. The people really make the job worth being there. The technology is very outdated. Most of everything is done manual. Software patches are applied manual. Very vtime consuming.work from home is possible sometimes, but it is not in their policy. There is alot of turnover all throughout the company. If you have seniority it helps. Management does not notice when a job is done well. Company holds a headquarters meeting every quarter to let employees know how the business is doing and what they have planned for the future."
good,"Staff is fun and easy-going, during a typical weekday the store is not busy. The store's peak times are mainly around the holidays, and weekends, especially leading to Halloween. If you get hired during Halloween and are offered a permanent position as a sales associate, your shifts/ hours will be dramatically cut over time. Management is fairly laid back which is both a pro and a con. The hardest part of the job will be dealing with difficult customers. With that said, the highlights of the job will also be while interacting with various customers. What I've learned is that It's definitely a good place for a first-time job, highly recommend if you do consider this job apply only during Halloween."
good,"The other employees didn‚Äôt really enjoy their job, nor did they really try at it. Some were rude. The work was dreadfully boring but extremely easy. The manager was really understanding tho."
good,Working as a part time associate at Party City gave me a great experience to know what it is like to work in retail. The outcome was beneficial because I developed more knowledge with handling certain situations with customers and handling cash.
good,"It's a good place to work"
good,"Party City should care more about their employee, they care more about making money they do not care if employee feel well in the place well you  work or if you need to learn new things in your career to bring a better service to them, they just care about making money, employee are not important for them which is very stupid thinking"
good,Job was great although I would say that the training process does need work. Not much attention to what each worker needed work on also. Working with a team was great and memorable.
good,the job was great traveling seeing different states and cities.  just was a contract job so it didn't last long.  laid off with promises to advance; to just being laid off with little to no notice.
good,The location was good and the manager was good to work with. Certain former coworkers were somewhat difficult to work with and customers could be a pain but otherwise overall okay.
good,"This job was alright I personally didn't like some of the managers there, they was rude and not understanding at times but other than that it's a simple job"
good,Gives you the feel of a fast paced work environment especially around Halloween however there's never enough hours any other season of the year. It was a great job to balance during high school.
good,Its a great work environment everyone is kind and always laughing. Unfortunately there are never hours which means you wont get a lot of money on your check. They also just pay you the bare minimum so a lot of people barely get by.
good,Party city was a fun job to have but wasn‚Äôt a good paying job. Minimum wage of $7.25 and it was 25 mins away from me. It is a good first job that teaches communication skills
good,"Really enjoyed my time at party city besides the lack of hours and low pay for what they were making me do, would give me management jobs to do on the floor but never advance me for higher pay, or manager training. Loved the people I worked with too, just obvious they the higher ups don‚Äôt really care about their employees."
good,It was an awesome job but the management i delt with while working at the store i did was not fun. The manager at the time was very unproffesional towards dealing with issues with employees and was very rude and inappropriate with handling situations infront of customers
good,"Very fun for high school students as a stepping stool. Definitely no advancement whatsoever. Party City is more of a ""temporary"" place to be for those unsure of a career path."
good,"Working there during Halloween/October is when the store is most busy. Your on your feet during your whole shift. Its a fun, fast paced work environment."
good,i have worked at many places as a manager and party city will have to be one of the worst places i have worked at. there's no employee appreciation. benefits are not that great. everything is disorganized. Horrible pay for the amount of work i do. its a disgrace.
good,You basically get $7.25 to start and never go up unless you work there for a year or so. I suggest high schoolers apply for this job since hours are very flexible.
good,"Typical day at work - come in and start with balloon orders, then checking the front counter and cleaning up area, stocking empty bulk balloons, and waiting on customers."
good,"Opened and closed the store.  Received in new products and brought out to the floor in the appropriate spot.  Reset planograms as needed.  Filling balloon orders for customers.  "
good,"I was a seasonal worker during the halloween time period. The work was fast paced and stressful at times, especially the day of halloween. Most of my time was spent stocking the shelves and answering customers if they had questions."
good,Learn a few things. Can get confusing due to hypercritical with information of duties. Awesome co-workers which can be the most enjoyable part of the job. Some managers speak to you like your are stupid when asked a question. Some days are good days and some days you can't wait to leave.
good,The workplace was not enjoyable. Management was adequate at best and the environment was not the best for learning. It was just an okay experience working there and the work days were mundane.
good,"A typical day consisted of restocking shelves, filling party orders, cashier and customer service."
good,as a warehouse associate there isn't much to the day outside of walking around a fulfilling orders. work is easy but rather exhausting from all the walking and standing with little break time.
good,"Typical work day includes stocking shelves, blowing up balloons, and assisting customers on the sales floor. "
good,"It's a seasonal job and if you like the holiday halloween it's a decent part time job to have during the halloween season, and a good starting point for young teens to get their feet wet in the workforce."
good,Worked here while going through first year of college. It is the typical retail job for all 18 year olds just breaking into the job world. Not a bad place to work.
good,The environment was slow paced on most days and required limited customer service skills or skill at all. The best part about the job was the slow pace and being able to relax while working.
good,"Full-time benefits and flexible schedule, as well as PTO.  It was an occasionally stressful job because we had a hard time keeping staff around.  Fairly low-paying job, but the environment was mostly fun."
good,"The management and entry level employees are usually fairly tight knit, but that doesn't change the hours and the pay being barely above minimum wage. Still, it's alright for a short term job, though the Halloween season is pretty stressful."
good,Working at party city was alright I.T had its challenges. Overall the people were nice and I.T was a different from other retail jobs. At party city you had to be on your feet at all times ready to listen to ourcomes.
good,"handling the cash register was easier than inventory. with so many things in the store, and no seemingly clear map of where to put inventory, sometimes things wouldn't get put away properly for days at a time."
good,Very informative. Not very lenient. I have learned to lift heavy boxes.   Door greeter was the most fun out of all the position. Stayed overnight to stock products.
good,"Halloween is truly the busiest season that party city has, and they hire a lot of people around that time to handle the amount of work that needs to be done. Fun environment and friendly people but after halloween the you're hours schedualed per week drop as low as having one 5.5 hour shift per week, not enough."
good,"I love this company and I think this is a great job, but there are no benefits even when I am working almost full time and not many chances to advance."
good,"Party City is a unique company. They are not very up to date with current technology, however. The hours are varied. Some weeks you are working at least 40 hours (which is what full-time workers should work), while other weeks you only work 32. Work schedules vary too often and the schedule for the following week gets posted a day before it starts, which leaves very little time to schedule time for family or other needs outside of work."
good,"i worked here as a seasonal worker for the Halloween season and it was a great experience. i got to work with some awesome people. i definitely had a fun time, but i found that sometimes one of my supervisors would put me on costume wall and then ask me to do something in another area of the store, which is fine, but then they'd get upset if i wasn't on the wall despite that they had moved me from it."
good,Party City is a fun place to work at especially when your coworkers know how to make the job fun. From my experience being there its been great not until a certain coworker arrived at the job. From then on work has been a nightmare. She makes my life difficult and I'm not very happy about it anymore.
good,I had the privilege of working with some wonderful people and learn new skills. Every day there was something new and all co workers were very supportive and helpful of one another
good,"PartyCity is a quick paced, busy, fun environment to work in. Minimum wage is the paying rate and holidays are usually given off. Manager is flexible and easy going."
good,"It was a decent place to work on a temporary basis. There was not really a set schedule, and it was very crazy around holidays. Would not be the best long term job. Not much room for moving up."
good,I worked there seasonal from September to December during their busiest months because of Halloween around the corner. It was extremely stressful and nerve wrecking.
good,Not much to say about party city. I was a seasonal worker during Halloween and my job was focused on customer service and being a cashier. If you're hired as a seasonal employee don't expect to have a job very long and don't expect good pay.
good,"Good work place for any young adult trying to get their first real job, 75% of the time customers are friendly and outgoing, but during halloween customers can be rude when it comes to costume shopping"
good,A typical day at party city was crazy. All cause during Halloween the store would be jammed packed with customers. Management wasn't the best in my opinion. An the workplace vibe wasn't all the way put together as it should have been. There was somethings in my opinion that could have been better.
good,"Work consists of restocking shelves, selling costumes to customers, and cleaning the store after hours. Friendly work environment. The hardest part of the job is helping multiple customers at once."
good,in party city retail stores you are overworked and not paid enough for everything you do. they want to avoid paying employees more and it is very unfair.
good,"Party City is a good place to work at as long as you are under good management. It can be fast paced with a lot of projects happening at the same time, so you have to make sure you are task oriented and can handle a rush."
good,"A typical day work is associates doing freight, recovering the store helping customer through out the store in the front end cashiering and helping customer with whatever they ask the we can provide."
good,"While I do enjoy working for this company, the benefits and pay do not in anyway reflect the amount of time and work that you put in to making a store great or even efficient. As a manager, you are given a zone to work in and keep up to date with the latest revisions, products, and tasks such as replenishment. In conjunction with these tasks, you are also expected to run the store, help with other team members zones and run register if there are not enough hours for other employees to work. It can be tedious but for someone who likes to stay busy, it can be worth it. However, what is not worth it is the lack of pay associated with the amount of work any manager is required to do and the inability for that work to be equally dispersed fairly. I myself have on more than one occasion, worked the zones of other managers consistently, done all the office paperwork and filed it in an organized manner, been in charge of organizing the office, stocking areas, and the floor top stock all while trying to work my own zone and potentially run register at the same time. Multitasking is essential but the hard work can pay off in the form of knowing that you yourself have done an excellent job but in very little other respects."
good,Party City was a great place to work and I was around a great management staff and we all worked as a team. The only issue was Upper Upper management the DM would never show up at the store and we she did there was a lack of communication.
good,"As my first job, Halloween city  gave me a great introduction into the work force. I enjoyed the feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day.  I felt It was a nice environment and clean environment."
good,It's a fun place to work but don't plan on staying. It's mostly part time during different holidays. Nonetheless it would be a great job for a high school or college student.
good,"store  on two notch recently brought by corporate hours dropped for everyone but management, no longer a pay raise each year, full time position no longer exist so no full time benefits(healthcare etc, Vacay, etc) Now the store is constantly understaffed with no way or reason to build up."
good,"Working at Party City was decent. I dealt with difficult people daily and I knew how to calm them down and help them, so that was a good experience. I would say that the management was not terrible, but it was for sure not the best. Th hardest part of the job was keeping everybody satisfied, including mangers, other employees, and customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was just being busy the entire time, there was always something to do."
good,"While the lack- luster salary earned here is a deterrent, the job itself is quite fun. You get to work with a variety of customers and help them plan their parties."
good,I loved this job. There is lots of room for growth and promotions. The customers are usually in a good mood since they are getting things ready for a party. Something new everyday. I felt the pay was not sufficient for my role as executive assistant. I also felt that the general manager was very unprofessional at the store I worked for.
good,"Working at Party City has been a very intense experience. From the packed holidays, to the calm, quiet, slow days. Becoming A Front End Supervisor has taught me a lot more responsibility.   My job does not really have a hard part, everything runs smoothly for the most part."
good,Work days are boring and uneventful. I learned skills that would benefit me in retail as well as miscellaneous skills. The management was incredibly poor
good,"I can handle any type of typical day. I learned that you can spread out about how good a company is. I always love to work w/management & co-workers. The hardest part, is actually nothing at all. The most enjoyable part of the job is working, helping out the community & always stay positive."
good,"High paced work environment, in which my abilities where used but not to my full potential. Possible advancement opportunities, but very limited. Overall satisfied with the environment."
good,"It wasn't horrible but it is very busy during halloween. Makes for hurting feet."
good,a typical day at work is very boring because people don't show up that much. unless you can keep yourself busy then you'll be fine.
good,"This was really fun to work at and I really enjoyed being around toys and candy and balloons all day, and I got hired as a halloween seasonal associate, so I was around spooky decorations and things as well, which was really fun. Things slowed quickly and drastically right after halloween, and almost everyone hired was let go, but it was really fun helping people pick out decorations, gifts and costumes during the busy season, and I met some really great people. The management at my store was kinda questionable though, and there was a lot of nepotism, actually. One of my coworkers spread a nasty rumor about me, which always sucks, but management was kind of passive aggressive about it and never confronted me. All in all, I had a fun time working here, but I think that this job is best suited for people who are fun, high energy, and upbeat."
good,"wile i was only a seasonal employie, i worked my butt off every day where we originaly had 8 of us on night crew and by the time i was the season was over i was the last one. dispite them knowing i wanted the job the higher ups (other then my shift leader he wanted to higher me) i was let go due to them never seeing how much effort i put in to the job working solo."
good,Party city is a very fun place to work and fast paced when setting for the holidays. I have worked with outstanding people throughout the years.
good,"Like many retailers, Party City Promises it is a people company first and just misses the mark. The company is secure in that it is highly profitable, however the hours required and lack of organization may present even the toughest retail pro with obstacles that are too high to conquer. Pay is on par, as are the benefits. Party City gets a C+ from my perspective. It is not enough to want to be a great people company, you have to invest some time in resources to make that happen."
good,"Is a funny place to work, but they don't have  good communication with employees. Is a typical part time job for students without opportunities to growth."
good,"flexible time, enjoyable crew, and fun since people make it fun. restocking, placement of figures, and cleanliness. the people working at the time were friendly, courteous, and attentive towards teamwork and the customers. I was working part time so I did not experience lunchtime or receive full benefits since I was a minor. Overall, it is a good starting place for a high school student."
good,I learned how to run a cash register and help customers find costumes and decorations for Halloween. Co-workers were very friendly and helpful through the learning process.
good,employee to customer relations are paramont  love the interaction with different people.store hours are great not too early not too late.
good,A typical day at work was very slow because all I really did was restock items people returned or fixed merchandise that people took off the racks. I learned how to work in a working environment. The management was good my manager was nice and very eager to teach me things. The hardest part was not having anything to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was working on balloons.
good,A typical day at work was coming in getting started straight away. cashier was very fast paced job. working in the back with the costumes was also fast paced.
good,I had to main managers that I dealt with.  The store manager and the assistant manager.  The assistant manager hated me and we did not have a good relationship.
good,Constantly changing planograms and product marketing. Tight inventory control and teamwork was required to maintain a successful bottom line and prevent theft. multiple warehouse trucks every week with hundreds of cases in each trailer. Timely execution of all things including alterations for custom wedding orders.
good,"My job at Party City was only during Halloween season. I learned things like taking/making balloon orders over the phone, requesting customs and items from other stores, etc. The management was helpful and easy going. My co-workers were much younger than me at that time so I didn't really have much in common with them, but we all got along well. The hardest part of my job was again, being on my feet all day and having to work nights and weekends. The most I liked about that job is that I was able to continue going to college and that they would accommodate my schedule around it."
good,A typical day at work was anything from stocking shelves to running the register or running the balloon counter. the biggest thing I learned was how valuable putting in just that little bit of extra effort could be. The management loved me because I showed up on time and did my job. My co-workers were mixed but there were definitely some great people that made the job enjoyable usually. The hardest part of the job was probably halloween when the store got really busy. The best part was the people who I worked with. One became and still is one of my closet friends. I think any job can be enjoyable if the people around you are hard working and pleasant to be around.
good,"Seasonal position that I thought I would have been working after because I personally thought I was an amazing worker compared to others (not to be boastful of myself). It was fun being around people who were into Halloween, given that I wasn't because of how I was raised. Typical days would be 6-10 hour shifts, that would be boring and long. We only got one hour an hour break, and usually you didn't have time to take a break if the store was busy. Customers would ask for certain products we wouldn't have, and of course it would suck. Also, it was fun to see little kids try on costumes, or a customer would ask for advice when picking one out. The managers apparently didn't always last long at this particular store, and the assistant manager would be very moody at times. Granted, I never really got on their bad side, but when they snapped, it was quite shocking. Pay was minimum wage, and they hated you talking to your co-workers while on your shift. Team leaders didn't always get a long with the assistant manager either. Some employees would be so lazy, and would leave their work half done, and the evening employees would have to finish the job. I was training other employees and I was new myself, so sometimes, they would come to me, and ask questions. You had to also watch your pay, because they would put in the wrong amount of hours you worked. So then you'd have to wait the next two weeks to get payed."
good,"A day at work at Halloween city was educating, I learned customer service skills and retail skill, along with communication skills. Management was organized and well mannered. My co-workers were very well put together, hard workers and easy going."
good,"Party City is a very great place to work with room to advance to the next level. The managers are mentors and they teach you how to grow and advance to the next level. the environment is always changing. The hardest part of the job is that it is always changing with the seasons, and the store is constantly changing. The most enjoyable part is that it is never boring."
good,"Working at Party City is a great place to gain experience. It hasn't been great working there. I was able to gain experience in customer service, communication skills and financial skills."
good,"Fun workplace, with many fun and interesting features. Great management. Best part of this job was to work alongside of my colleagues, which was  recipe for a fun working environment. Most of the staff are young and upbeat."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping hundreds of customers find the perfect Halloween outfit or accessory. I learned that every person is different and should be helped according to their wants and needs as an individual. The management was very determined to teach the workers yet focused on their priorities at the same time. Most of my co-workers were motivated, but some lacked motivation and were just there for a money on the side. The hardest part of this job was remembering where every item was in the store. I am very grateful for this challenge because it taught me summarization and strengthened my memory. The most enjoyable part of this job was seeing a customer leave the store with their new costume or accessory, counting down the days until Halloween."
good,A typical day at work was fairly busy. What I enjoyed most about my job was putting together a party for a customer. From the balloons to the invitations. There was rarely a dull day at work. The hardest part of work was the lack of communication with coworkers and management.
good,"A typical day at Party City consist of doing freight, setting up plan-a-grams. If you're on register then you would assist customers with check out. If they needed to purchase balloons you can create a balloon order for future pick up or inflate them right then and there."
good,"Morning shift starts at 7am."
good,"Overall a pretty easy job at least for me, all of the employees come and go even the management. I have had over five different main store managers while working there all four years."
good,"A typical day consist of helping customers, stocking the store, doing resets according to the seasons, holidays, handle any customer or associate concerns or needs in a fast friendly manner, training or coaching associates as needed. Sometimes will be required to cover for other managers when they call in and end up working open to close."
good,"Is a great job if your a teenager still in high school. There is barely any room for promotion and the management was all over the place. I was myself part of the management but it was really hard to get any ideas across. if your above the age of 18, this is not the job for you."
good,My co workers are awesome the management needs an improvement. We have lost a lot of hour. The most enjoyable part of the job is that everyone gets along and works together. I have learned a lot about sales and customer service.
good,"Typical work day includes helping customers with various questions they may have regarding items, answering the phone, inflating balloons with helium, restocking shelves with new freight and generally keeping the store clean. Management can vary widely. Some are very strict and orderly, others are very careless and bend the rules because they can. Working as a cashier can at times be hectic and fast-paced, having to do multiple tasks at once. Being the floor associate is slower paced and more straight forward. I learned a lot of patience dealing with customers, and I gained some confidence in myself dealing with tough customers. All in all, a good place for younger people trying to work through college to get some retail experience in."
good,"When it comes to the seasonal staff my impression of them was that they were young. This is a job typically given to high school age people, and it shows in the atmosphere at work. It wasn't very professional, but people seemed to get along well enough all across the board. The full-time staff were responsible and gave clear direction. The unprofessionalism mainly came from the seasonal staff that knew they wouldn't have the job for very long. A typical day went by quickly for me. I was either on the phone and checking stock for customers or at the cash register. The difficult part was remembering the sells we had because of the Halloween season. Each weekend we had a new promotion. The most enjoyable part was helping people find costumes and helping them create unique decorations for their parties, as well as blowing up balloons for birthday parties."
good,"Not really a place to go to for career advancement, and not a place where you'll make good money, since the hours are few and far unless you're working a full season of a holiday"
good,"Small company.  The benefits are a bit expensive for the coverage provided.  If you are hands on, you will like working for the company. Company is to getting better organized and is putting management in place. Good work Life balance and Holliday season is slow and time off is approved.  Closed for most Holidays."
good,"The company was very encouraging and wanted to create a fun working environment. A company gym was provided and activities such as yoga and Pilates were offered. A day started with checking E-mail, voice-mail and the help desk queue for any existing issues. After determining the workload, it was my role to fix all pre-existing computer issues or new ones that came through that day. This involved software/hardware maintenance, repair, or setup. "
good,Working with helium and balloons and toys all day wasn't all that great. Management was not organized at all. Everything was messy about this place.
good,"After clocking in, a manager would brief me on where I would be placed during the work day. I was usually on the sales floor doing freight or setting up displays, but I would occasionally be put at the register. If I was on the floor, there would sometimes be communication issues between the members of management, because one person would want me to work on one thing, another team leader on a different task, etc, etc."
good,"I started out as a Halloween expert under the management of Tisha that day consisted of getting costumes prepared, assisting customers with completing their outfits, and answering any and all questions they may have had. When cashiering, I would answer the phones, complete balloon orders, advise customers of the procedures and policies of the company"
good,"Everyone there was nice, did their jobs, and didn't let drama get in the way of that"
good,Fast Paced  Busy couple weeks before Halloween. Great to work with interesting and fun product.s
good,"A typical day at work is either opening or closing, no in between shifts, which I enjoyed. I learned a lot about the company including how they advertise. The management was okay, but they needed to show more of their management skills where they lacked. My co-workers were great to work with, always friendly. The hardest part of the job was the customers in our busiest seasons. The most enjoyable part of the job was the balloons. Many times I got to help the customers create different personalized balloon boquets."
good,Always busy with something to do is a pro but not having enough time to finish your duties is a con. The management is decent but whenever there is a bad egg nothing is done about it. They tend to transfer you to different stores frequently and you either go or lose your job.
good,My typical day at work is busy during the afternoon time. I learned how to communticate with customers and getting what they want. The managment is good and prepare to meet every task before the deadline. Most of my co-workers are dependable youths that come to work prepared and doen't slack off. The difficult part of the job is handleing new shipments. The enjoyable part of my job is having fun with my other co-workers while working to entertain the customers.
good,"Typical day at Work:"
good,"Assistant Manger I did morning or closing paperwork, deposits, receiving, inventory"
good,I would go in and clock in. and start my day which would consist of two things. The first was cleaning Id go isle to isle bringing the stock to the front of the shelf. Second was sales. I spent the day helping customers find whatever they needed if we carried it. I learned to work with the public in this job and to up sell accessories to costumes. The hardest part of the job was knowing there was a 90% chance it would only last a couple months. The best part was helping the excited customers build their perfect Halloween costumes.
good,"making sure everything was running smoothly registers, employees and customers were satisfied.learned ins and out of stock files in the computer and organizing them."
good,"When I started working here, I've gotten to know many great people, some of whom have moved on to better jobs. Now it's my turn. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate the job, but at this point of my life, I need a better paying job, and this isn't the place for me anymore. The most enjoyable part of being here was working with great co-workers and interacting with great customers from time to time. My only problem was, I was often relied on by all of the managers in the store, so when I would come in to work, they all had some sort of plan for me, and it was hard for me to get any tasking done. I felt like i was being pulled in 5-6 different directions. I got frustrated after awhile to the point that I want out. If I'm going to bust my behind, I want to work somewhere I can make better money than what I'm getting now, which i'm barely getting by with."
good,"Typical day at work is helping customers find what they need for their events , I've learned a lot the past few months working their , My co-workers are good people , Hardest part of the job is dealing with a bad customers we get those sometimes"
good,"cleaning daily"
good,The atmosphere was great and there were plenty of friendly people. the management was easy to approach and always were good about keeping workers on task. very diverse population of workers made for quick friendships. no room for advancement and no benefits. the work was plentiful for some people but others were bored throughout half of the night
good,I loved working there when I was a teenager with people my age. We had a lot of fun.
good,"always changing hoildays, cashier and setting planograms have great customer service always helpful"
good,"A very stress driven job for the most part. As a manager you are almost REQUIRED to be 24/7 accessible. Rarely are managers promoted from within, mostly outside hires."
good,"Great job! Love the Halloween season. Pay is not good, but management experience is what counts."
good,"i would arrive on time, clock in, and go to the back. every time i made a mistake the boss would tell me, but never complimented me on what i did right. i had to stand for hours, only getting a 15 minute dinner break, and we had to clean everything to our bosses liking, and he was VERY picky."
good,It was a good work environment. the Supervisors and my other coworkers were amazing to work with but the manager wasnt best the manager was all ways in the office never did much.
good,Days go by fast but you work plenty of hours and deal with plenty of rude customers.
good,Fun retail job for the season of Halloween. Learned how to work a picture wall and cash register. Closing was the hardest part of the job.
good,Solid company to grow in. District Managers and Regional Manager ask for way too much to get done with little hours.
good,Enjoyable experience. Professional Management. Very capable Company.
good,This was a seasonal job so it didn't last to long but it was fun working at a halloween store helping adults and kids pick out their outfits
good,"Party City is a great starter job for young persons, especially during Halloween. Working for Party City teaches the fundamentals of merchandising and helps build basic customer service practices. Just like other larger companies, Party City is an invaluable resource for starting younger applicants on the road towards their eventual career goals."
good,"not a good place to work , really dirty, not really friendly . I would not like to work here any more or seek employment at any party city."
good,"prty city is a fast paced environment, your able to keep busy and never get bored."
good,It was good working there I had a good time there they pay good.also they are Strict about the work you do also want you to be on time you have to wear what they ask u.
good,A great day at work would begin at clocking in at your shift time and begin work at either the cashier or begin re-shop. We are to greet every customer at the door and assist anyone with questions.
good,I didn't get made into a part time employee after seasonal. They instead decided to keep someone else that was seasonal and all the other employees that barely worked and were on their phone the entire time. They fired me even though I gained good experience working there and knew how to do my job.
good,It is a really nice place to work at. I learnt how to be organized and keep everything neat and tidy and I learnt how to be confident with customers around you and speaking to people.
good,Make sure customers are finding everything they need. Cleaning and restocking the store. While organizing the store back to where it was the previous morning.
good,I absolutely loved  this job everything was amazing. There is no better job than this one. If the money was good I would definitely go back to this job
good,The good about this job was that if you needed help they will help you in tech you  the bad was when it was time for us to close it would be foreverr.
good,"It was nice, but if you're younger, than they will push all of the work load on you. I enjoyed working the halloween seasonal position just because I made a lot of friends, and enjoyed making the kids happy, the only thing that was off, was the managers would sit and put all work on younger kids."
good,"Working for Party City Corporation in Colonial Heights, Va was very exciting. Party City is a fun job for those who are opened minded and loves helping others."
good,"Party city is fun to work at, everyone is really friendly and customers are always satisfied. Working there feels like home. I rate this job 5 starts out of 5."
good,"Working at party city wasn't the best experience due to the late times we got out on school nights, but my co workers made my experience so much better with persistent work and laughter."
good,Great people but a little stressful at times but its cool to work at party city customers are great to they respect all of us managers are cool also no issues with them
good,Working here as a temp for the season wasn't all that great. The managers worked me at hours I couldn't work during the school week. They don't give you minimum hours they give you the most.
good,"I think those two words say it all. My managers and supervisors are all very good people, otherwise I wouldn't have stayed here for three years and still continue working here now. And I honestly do enjoy helping people, I just want to find work that isn't simply helping them find a particular item or set up a balloon order."
good,Easy for the most part until the store became crowded.  when we would get a large sum of customers then things would start to get out of hand and it would take time before we would gain control of the situation again.
good,Awsome and fun place to work awsome ppl to work with and to meet fast paced  repeating  everything everyday so long days not much breaks not much for a lunch break to but ok job
good,"fill different balloon orders "
good,Working there is too hectic for the $9.25/hour they give you. The customer are rude. And the managers expect you to perform magic like your getting paid 13/hour.
good,Typical day is trying to do as much as possible and sometime its gets boring. The management is average. Lots of young faces. What i liked the most is finding the item the customer wants.
good,I enjoyed working at Party City. I learned that there is always a solution to a problem.  The hardest part of the job was getting my peers to think outside the box.
good,the Experience o had at party city was very nice met knew people got to learn how to sell products but there was some down falls like certain co-workers
good,Party City has a tough job format for store manager.  The  Freight flow takes most of your time.  There is very little payroll to get the merchandise processed.  Merchandise is delivered everyday monday through friday.    The seasonal change outs are not very efficient.  you are constantly emptying and moving merchandise according to company directives.   The management team is the staff that does this therefore not allowing time for anything else after the daily freight is processed.  The normal aspects of running a box store is depleted.  There is very little time for training and developing a team.   other than your management staff it is all part time employees with very little buy in.   they are there for their 15 to 20 hours a week then on to something they are passionate about.   with just a few shifts a week for an employee it does not allow the opportunity to grow or learn.   Good luck    you will need it.
good,Party City is a very task oriented company. The struggle is to get everything accomplished within the timelines. Payroll hours are at a  minimum level. The days fly by.
good,"it was a fun job, but the managers were very strict even when you are a new person just trying  to figure iut the ropes and how everything and who everyone is."
good,"I would have to say that this site"
good,this job requires a lot of attention to detail and a whole lot of smiling. if you love being surrounded by a bunch of colors and making people happy then this is the job its always a party there.
good,"Good management, under staffed at times but they always made it work. Very organized business, didn‚Äôt make sales goals often due to lack of employees but overall wonderful management and benefits"
good,"Never again in my life would I work for party city ever again, they management is all messed up and you don‚Äôt get good hours cause they don‚Äôt wanna pay you"
good,"its a good place to work, but if you are looking for a part-time job this is what you are looking for, halloween is the craziest time of year with the costume wall being so big and extensive that you can pretty much find any kind of costume your looking for"
good,We used to be a franchise and our owner was forced by there corporate that they were going to take too much of the profit back from the franchise. The franchise owner was forced to sell back and then all of the custotmer service and relationships that we built were ruined with our customers as we would have no hours to support them the way that they were used to being helped.
good,the location I worked at closed due to poor management. Constantly not given the proper amount of breaks overworked in the holiday season. 30% employee discount.
good,"After Halloween my hours were cut. I had to get a second job so I could keep up with expenses. But my overall work experience there was pleasant, had good management and good team orientation."
good,"Productive work environment, easy to get along coworkers, learned good social skills, good team player, on site training, paid training and good supervisors."
good,"Working as a supervisor at Party City was pretty difficult. During the Halloween season, I would have to train over 20 new hires along with giving assignments to about 40+ workers at the end of the night."
good,"During the Halloween season, the environment was very stressful as it was difficult to take breaks. Everyone was very busy across all functions. I did not have the opportunity to work during the rest of the year so I am unaware if the work environment is different then."
good,"I enjoyed working with party city for the time being great customer service and great supervision , flexibility with schedule was fair and could work in my favor."
good,Nice place to work. Payroll difficult to work with. Good people to work with and nice work atmosphere. Left to go back and complete real estate education.
good,"The work was very routine related to restocking shelves, conducting inventory and providing customer services with completing party supply orders. The hours were regular and provided consistent pay."
good,"- coworkers were very nice "
good,Party City is A great place to work do to it keep you on your feet. I love Party City they have every type of party decoration. Only thing I didn't like was the price was very hard
good,"if you love Halloween this much then work here because you can interact with customers that want to buy costumes, decorations, balloons, and so much more!"
good,"I was put to work part time, but ended up working a full time schedule. The pay wasn't worth the hours that I've put to work. It was very unorganized."
good,"The specific  party city I worked at the managers showed so much favoritism, would constantly yell at workers on the sales floor. The managers constantly belittled their employees.  Managers also would talk trash about a customer on the walkie talkie (which were required to wear) to the point it was so loud the customers could hear it. And CONSTANTLY racially profiling the customers!!"
good,Meeting new people was always fun. Children would always have a smile when they come in and leave. Always made my day and nights go by so smooth I would recommend someone.
good,"the management team from the manager and the assistants  really good at their job"
good,very  busy long lines and no bathroom breaks. low pay. pushy boss. would not do it full time. no future. rude customers. purely a second income. you are only respected if the boss likes you.
good,Solid company that is trying to streamline its processes and roll out new initiatives. Fun environment but challenging most times due to lack of payroll.
good,it was a good work environment. i personally didn't enjoy the job because i was working two/three days a week and very short hour shifts as well. i never really did much besides cash register and i wanted to be more involved in the company but i felt like i was never given a chance to.
good,"The management that this company picks is devastating. I‚Äôve seen so much potential within other people that would be good for management but unfortunately they go towards the wrong decision. I did so much work towards this company and got paid very little. They just need to higher the pay and give more hours. I understand where the hours come from but they need to keep up their game. 4-8 hours a week isn‚Äôt enough. Overall I had fun and it‚Äôs suck a cool experience,  I wouldn‚Äôt take it back."
good,I have worked there for 2 years and after all the changes it just became all about numbers and not about our customers.  They do not care about their employees family life or anything unless it is about party city
good,"Overall working for Halloween City was a great experience, however as a seasonal associate, I did work above my pay-grade. Once the season was over, the store had to get torn down."
good,"Fast paced"
good,"I started work with the promise of working enough hours to support myself until I could get into my career. I started out with extra hours, then dropped to the lowest level that I wanted. After that, I was scheduled less than 8 hours a week after numerous customer complaints. I feel that I could not be fully trained due to how busy the store was. I was not used to dealing with so many customers at one time, and felt overwhelmed with the amount of tasks that I was required to complete on my own. My managers all were nice and positive. I thought that this job would be fun- at times it definitely was- but I observed that newer associates like me struggled to reach the standards that were set up for us. The worst part was that my hours shifted so suddenly- my first ""too short"" week was my third week!"
good,I enjoyed working at party city because it was fun and there was never a boring second . I enjoy working with children and just people in general . I never had to deal with a problem or situation with customer service . It was a seasonal job I wish I could of been able to work there longer .
good,"I worked during Halloween, their busiest time.  The employees were supportive and the managers helped deal with difficult customers.  Mainly I worked the cash register."
good,A good place to work but advancement was a little limited and Sundays were a must to work and I am the youth leader of my church. It was always busy and that's a good thing. We were rewarded for our efforts with time off. Hardest part of the day was during the evening rush but we were always ready for the challenge
good,"I think that party city was an okay place to work. i was there for seasonal employment, and it was fun but some of the management wasn't so great. I wish it could have survived this town but it closed."
good,"Job culture was fun, helping people with their party ideas, and balloon arrangement was also fun. Always busy specially during Halloween. Fun to see holiday decor."
good,"Good place to work over all."
good,"my coworkers made it enjoyable but overall I did not enjoy my experience at this store. The manager was rude and had no reason to be rude to me, I was a hard worker."
good,"Lots of customers, very annoying sometimes. Hours were great, only reason i left was because it was a seasonal part time job. Improved social skills as well"
good,"While interning for Party City, I got firsthand experience on a job in retail goes and learned the fundamentals needed to work in said field. Things such as assisting the customers, doing recovery and stocking the shelves."
good,"I honestly don't remember much about this job. I had it during Halloween, so it was fast paced and my first job in sales. They always wrote me down as working somewhere and I would always work the register instead because they trained me after a while since they needed more people on register."
good,"A typical day consisted of balloons, stocking shelves, assisting customers, and being a cashier. Shifts are usually eight hours long and consist of a thirty minute lunch break. It can be stressful and chaotic at times but the foot traffic always slows down. The employees are mainly students."
good,"seasonal job during halloween season"
good,"It;s an ok place to work. Procedures often change, payroll is constantly being cut and freight is extremely heavy. They do close on Christmas,Thanksgiving and Easter."
good,it was okay but u only worked there for a short amount of time because it was only a seasonal job so i didnt keep the job for a long period of time...
good,I had a list of things I would have to get done each day. I had to use my time wisely. Management was fine they did what they needed to do. I liked the people I worked with. My job was not hard I just had to manage my time. I enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,"One of the more difficult retail jobs there because of the amount of energy, knowledge, stamina, and consistency that is needed to perform well in this job. If one can deal with what is needed from this job, one will be very happy and continue with the company for a long time."
good,"Very Busy around Holiday "
good,Started as a fun place to work. Once moved into management saw all the underlying problems. Not paid enough for what we do. Hourly pay is on low end of pay scale for job position compared to other companies with same position. Not given a lot of payroll but wants all these tasks completed without hours to complete them. Not enough payroll so not enough employees to compensate business. However balloons are fun.
good,"There was never a fixed schedule. One could close late and be due in early morning."
good,Although I was there for the Halloween rush that comes every year the work was fun for the most part and the customers weren't too bad. The only problem was how the costumes were organized and became distorted at the middle of the work day.
good,It was an okay summer job for working in the summer time when i was off school. It wasn't the best job but it wasn't the worst job either. it kept money in my pocket.
good,"Minimal benefits and incentives for employees. Short breaks, no paid lunches, consistent change of employees work hours. No healthcare provided to employees unless paid out-of-pocket by employee."
good,Told there would be advancement.  Then laid off after the holiday.  None of the employees I knew were full time.  Didn't like to payroll system either.
good,"If you are 16, this may be the job for you. If not, this place seems to attract the rudest customers ive met in all the customer service jobs i've worked at. I was promoted to Team Lead, then was told after 3 months of busting my butt off that they didn't have enough hours  for me and I was demoted. During that whole time I was never offered a raise. I worked for 2 years and was never offered a raise once."
good,offer permanent position to the younger crowds instead of seasonal jobs. I started as a part time employee for Halloween season then held over for holiday season. after Christmas was let go
good,working at this company was a good experience. fun around holiday season.get to interact with a lot of customers and show your customer service skills.
good,If you love Halloween then this is the job for you. You get to dress up and decorate the store for halloween. You have to set p and tare down the store.
good,"Although my experience at Party City was limited, due to my position only being seasonal, the workplace was positive, inviting, and I enjoyed my time there."
good,we were able o help customers with the idea of there costumes and help with parts. my favorite pat were the ballloons and how colorful it was in the store and how fun it was to be in everyday.
good,"As a sales associate at Party City, my responsibilities are to provide excellent customer service, stock and organize merchandise, maintain a cleanly sales floor, and cash-out customers. I worked during the Halloween rush, which is notorious for its particularly rigorous workflow and break-neck pace. This was subsequently followed by Thanksgiving and of course, Christmas and News Year. Unfortunately, certain obstacles had rendered the work environment in such a way that I no longer felt comfortable to operate within. These obstacles included: consistent understaffing, causing a severe lack of productivity and in some cases completely eliminated break time; reduced weekly hours; and, frankly, inappropriate and abrasive behavior unbefitting of certain individuals in power."
good,"Job can be stressful at times"
good,"It was a fun working environment, and a very easy job. Only problem I had was I didn‚Äôt get to go on lunch at my specific time, and the managers would knock stuff off the shelves on purpose."
good,honestly this job was so long ago i hardly remember i just recall helping angry costumers with finding costumes and then after the season was over that was that
good,will at party city i learned that party's came in all ages and that included 100 year old parties a proper way of tying balloon's help to but most of all time management was key to keeping up with orders and customers for them to have a great party time
good,Tenia un excelente ambiente laboral...el due√±o de la empresa es muy cercano a los trabajadores
good,"Worked there 2 Octobers as a seasonal employee (2015 and 2016). Had the same management both times. Nearly every time they were needed to help one of us or they were asked for by a customer they would be taking a smoke break. Not to mention, sometimes they'd be out on the floor smelling like smoke, and it always smelled like smoke in the back."
good,I worked the same amount of hours there as I did at dirt cheap and was still working there because of the pay I needed money and I made same amount as dirt cheap or more
good,"The company has a payment method where they put all of your money on a prepaid card, personally I found the card to be inconvenient because I prefer direct deposit."
good,Loved to work there but some of the other employees were not nice and they were not helpful. I would need extra help on something and no one would help. then when I told the manager she did nothing but laugh. It was fun when I did not have to work with some mean staff members.
good,The managers were not clear on anything so it was up to the employees to figure everything out the hard way. They were not even considerate of employees flexibility of hours.
good,"Customer service that ranged anywhere from relaxed to fast pace. Halloween gets extremely busy, almost like a frenzy. Team members are usually very helpful."
good,"There‚Äôs not much to say. This job is exactly what you think it would be. If you‚Äôre just an associate minimum wage and just working with customers all day and learning how to fill balloon orders. Some days it‚Äôs boring, but usually your co-workers get you through the shift."
good,"I didn‚Äôt really like it, because they don‚Äôt give you many hours. It‚Äôs slow paced, and the only time you will receive hours is around Halloween. After that your hours will be cut tremendously, which means no money !!!"
good,I only worked seasonal and the hours were long but I felt like the pay wasn't equal to the amount of hours I worked. sometimes i'd get no break but somehow they took it out of my pay every 2 weeks which wasn't fair.
good,The days were short and fast. Cashier sometimes got a little hectic. The managers were nice and friendly. The most enjoyable part the the job were the workers everyone was nice and just good people.
good,I left working on the visual plan a grams at party city they changed often because of the seasons in Halloween was a blast It was also fun helping customers plan parties and work on balloon bouquets
good,Great seasonal opportunity. Poor management but fun environment. Flexible schedule. Party expert for all kind of events. expensiveness costumes but popular ones available.
good,Loved everything about my job but costumers of course rude and on Halloween week they would let us wear the costumes in the back during our work shift.
good,Seasonal help so it was hectic. Constantly cleaning after customers and their kids. Workers were fun to work to. Learned how to stock the backroom. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find the right costume.
good,Its an alright place to work if you fit in. Luckily I did. It was difficult to tell unprofessional unmotivated people what to do. Just get by and get paid. Ignore the rest
good,"but really sad to have it end. "
good,"Working for Party City was fun while it lasted. Hours were all over the place though since it was a part time gig. If i had the chance to work there again, i probably would"
good,"it was a regular work place, nothing exciting, Everybody went in to start their day just to end it. Management was strong and strict but y9ou got used ton them. Pay wasnt worth it though"
good,"Party City was one of my first jobs. I loved it, everyone was really friendly and everyone was young. We all worked closely together and  it was always a fun time. And never felt like a job."
good,I enjoy working there but it has become to much of a drive since moving to camby. I wish I could continue working there but I just need to fine a more affordable drive.
good,The few months i liked working their but after awhile it came to the point where i didn't want to step foot in that place. The co-workers and the mangers make working more easier. I love my co-workers and managers we get along so well. We are like one big weird happy family.
good,"Fun place to work during the holidays especially as a teen. I made good friends at this company even though I was only a holiday worker. However, the customers  made the job irritating."
good,It was a very relaxed work place for my first job. The coworkers there were helpful and taught em a lot in  the small time I was there. Anyone need of a job should give Party City a try.
good,i loved working at party city .this was the first job that i hav eever liked but was paid low. the managers were so nice and fair and not having a boss mentality. they formed working personal relationships with the team.they made you feel at home. I was actually homeless workign here and i never had a bad day because of this place.it sucks that they pay isnt good at all
good,"I learned how to run the register "
good,It was fine for a college kid. days were always busy and i learned that  retail work is not that easy. management was always good to me. cleaning bathrooms were the toughest. the job was pretty much all enjoyable.
good,It was easy work just seasonal justbwish for more hours better breaks because your on your feet all day anyways other than that everything was good even staff were good people
good,It was fun to work at party city and the managers were great but very little pay and very little hours too many employees so hours weren‚Äôt shares eveningly.
good,"Great first job for when I was in high school, it created discipline and work ethic at a young age. It was an eye opener for why I wanted to be successful."
good,Party City is a great place to work at if you are a teenager living at your parent's house other than that it can't pay your bills unless you work for the company like a maniac
good,"It was fun working at Party City, but it was just so many mundane tasks that were over stressed. Also it was only ever busy during holidays. After that, customers were rare. I also couldn't blow up/tie a balloon to save my life."
good,"Fast-paced environment."
good,"The company has floated listlessly for the better part of 20 years but current changes in executive management seems to have righted the ship, which is a welcome change."
good,"A typical day was fast paced. I learned how to be productive. The management and work culture were fine. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we are busy, especially during Halloween season. The hardest part of the job was the lack of available hours."
good,"Great job, could use a little help in the management area, overall really fun. Hours are flexible during school and the environment was great and upbeat."
good,good first job or early life job just out of high school. not a huge career path. Fun work environment. training is lack luster at best. management takes breaks together so non management has nobody to rely on.
good,"They promised me that they would be able to give e a job at the end of Halloween, but they decided to give one of the lower newer employees the job, it was ok"
good,"It was interesting. Had to come out my comfort zone and be more social/ out there! I tried my best in everything I did! Although some days was better than others, I didn‚Äôt mind working there"
good,"If you want to have your first job, let it be party city."
good,"Great place to start if you've never worked or had a retail job before. It's fun while it lasted but then it gets old really quick, especially on some of the biggest holidays. For instance, Halloween. You'll either find some way to enjoy it while employed there or grow to vehemently hate it(like I did). This goes the same for Valentines day and New Years. Never have I ever blown up so many balloons for ungrateful, impatient people. Better not pop a balloon or someone might lose their mind."
good,The hours were always up and down. One week you would have 34 hours and the next week you would have 9 hours. The managers also didn't know how to handle situations well when it came to employee complaints.
good,Okay started job for high schoolers and young adults. Saturdays are stressful because of the balloon orders but other than that ots a basic retail job.
good,This was my first job and I only worked the seasonal position. I loved helping the customers and stocking the aisle. I learned team work and customer service skills.
good,Typical day at Party city was proactive and fast past environment. Having the daily duties of customer service and taking care of their needs. Being able to locate all items as needed in the store.
good,seasonal job. duties included making sure assigned isle was stocked and clean. assist customers. and help set up the Halloween store as well. also would close and clean the store.
good,"It's not a bad job by any means. Some of the administrative methods can be considered a bit archaic, such as counting money with a tray and calculator, with meter long receipts, but other than that it's a decent job, mostly hiring seasonal, then possibly get on for the rest of the year. Normal retail stuff other than that."
good,Durring the time I worked with halloween city business was very slow. The manager was very friendly.  Always found myself restocking or fixing merchendice displays.
good,"I only worked during Halloween time, which is very chaotic at times. The job itself is super easy, and the staff is fun to work with. Good place for a first job."
good,"Besides inconsistent hour, and the fact that you don't know your schedule until just before the work weeks starts its a pretty decent place to work. Management is very accommodating when it comes to giving you days off. Which is nice because it's hard to plan around a schedule you don't know. Most of the problems come from the corporate side of things."
good,"I didn't understand the costume stocking system, and after my seasonal job for Halloween I can imagine why they hire so many people for it. Warning: It was crazy. Probably would not work there again simply because the costumes."
good,Party City was my first job and probably my favorite. My supervisors were friendly but stern and made sure everyone pulled their weight. I enjoyed the atmosphere.
good,I enjoyed all my coworkers and the job responsibilities were very fair. You were never bored and learned a lot about customer service. It was a fun temporary experience.
good,"Working at Party City, there would always be something to do no matter what time is it in the day. Quick on your feet and especially with multitasking. Other employees would help when asked and it has its days where it would be stressful or it would be a relaxing day."
good,"I was only a seasonal employee for the Halloween season. However, I did enjoy working there even though my time there was during their most hectic time period."
good,Good first time job for a student or some right out of high school... some jobs are good for some people some aren‚Äôt .I need a more long term career  position
good,"Stressful, low staffed, expected beyond multi tasking, underpaid freight associate. Management was not professional. Short/no breaks. Always busy. One employee expected to organize the entire time."
good,Party City is fast paced and the staff was always short handed. I learned how to run a shift and also work faster on projects. Stocking and keeping the store clean was part of your daily duties.
good,Pretty high energy. I was only employed during peak season so it was pretty busy. The staff was fine and the upper level staff were pretty good people and decent leaders. However had many mixed emotions from other coworkers.
good,"Working at Party City can be a give or take situation. You could have a good manager to back you up, or a bad manager who blames others for their mistakes. "
good,nice little place to work. nice job to make some extra cash. management was alright. wasnt always there to help or if something went wrong. small area to work in.
good,"Provided customer service to patrons of products."
good,"For a first jb, the experience was enlightening. The staff was very understanding and willing to help me learn and grow and become a better cashier and sales associate. The jobs very stressful during peak hours."
good,"It was a laid back job with not many customers every day. The management was really good, and so were the other employees. Did not pay much, but it is a good ""first job"""
good,"Great for a first job. But the pay is not enough for what we do. Each employee does an overwhelming amount of work around the store, but we are still paid dirt. I have a manager who is living paycheck-to-paycheck. "
good,"The job can be very stressful due to lack of employees scheduled. Corporate only allows employees to work less than 20 hours a week at other locations."
good,"What more can I say? Sucky pay, no benefits, and you're around helping customers and/or stocking up shelves. Your usual party days are often busy. Best for someone in high school student"
good,Party City is your average retail chain. Nothing special good or bad. The amount of employees exponentially grows with temps around Halloween while its the busiest time of year. The whole rest of the year its pretty quite besides little bumps for special occasions.
good,"Management has definitely been a large issue during my time there. The people who are hired to run a store are not management material. Many of us have been treated unfairly and favoritism runs rampant. Anytime these concerns are brought up you are immediately shut down. Everything else has been wonderful, I love my team and I enjoy what I do."
good,the workers were nice and customers were also patient and nice. Everyday someone would try to steal something though. Dressing room was always flooded with people.
good,Party city is a fun place to work but management is not good there. Plus it is hard to get more hours. The schedules didn't come out early enough. Also it was hard to get days off.
good,Fun and great place to work at there's always something to do or try one. Closer to the end of October it will start to feel endless and the cleaning will become longer.
good,"Very easy, relaxed place to work. Most of the day i stocked merchandise. Okay coworkers, not the greatest. Management could of been better. Probably the easiest job ive had."
good,"Working at Party City was a seasonal job that I enjoyed for the time being."
good,"it was fun because i was working seasonal for halloween but other than that it was pretty slow after , i wouldn't work here as a part time jon because for me i love fast pace and i actually like doing things"
good,"A typical work day is usually slow paced consist of running the registers, blowing up balloons, and stocking freight. management is friendly and not to strict."
good,Organizar y ser un empleador capaz de dar guias alos clientes con precicion y mamtener el orden en el ambiente
good,Good place to work if you are a high school student looking to get a job to put on your resume. Not for long term working. Minimum wage pay and fee hours available.
good,"Worked during their Halloween seasonal position. Was a fun place to work, enjoyed helping kids and adults choose their Halloween costumes and finding accessories for them. Management was fair with hours especially when my classes ran long."
good,"They're extremely flexible with hours which helps a lot if you're a student whos class hours can change by semester. They are fast-paced, especially during the holiday season. And they have a fun atmosphere."
good,"I wasn't allowed to continue work because of current enrollment in high school and extracurricular activities at school (Band and Varsity Bowling). Also, because of my arthritis, swelling of every working joint, and current unrelieved problems with my arthritis, they terminated my employment after the need for employees for Halloween season was over."
good,Working at oarty city is fine slow paced working untill its the holiday time especially Halloween it‚Äôs extremely fast paced and it tests your patience with rude loud customers store will be extremely crowded due to the costumes and customers are extremely rude
good,"When i was working there, i developed an eye twitch that would start as soon as I pulled up into the parking lot and up until I went to bed that night. As soon as I quit, my eye stopped twitching"
good,Party City was great to be a part of. During Halloween season there was so much work to do. Helping customers and a lot of stocking. The closer it got to the holiday the more faced paced to job was. I liked being called in early mornings around 5am to help with stocking and putting things in order for the customers.
good,Great company to work for but doesn't want to pay .Wants things to be done at a certain day. Great benefits take care of there employees. high energy people and positive co workers
good,"Party City is another place where young people can put in work experience toward their resumes. Overall, like any other place of retail, can have a bendable atmosphere."
good,"slow when not in Halloween season. sucky hours for sure. but fun, relaxed, but stressful during season. A good starter job for those who never worked before."
good,This was one of my first jobs in retail and it was quite laid back and relax. It has a flexible schedule and is a laid back job. The pay is very low and there are not many benefits to working to here.
good,Was very time consuming and tedious job with very little reward for the end of the season bonus that was promised on average the bonus was less than 200.00
good,"didn't work there long it was ok. I got a better job offer before really working there so, I took that and left party city, but it was fast pace specially during Halloween when, its at it's really busy."
good,I was a college student when I worked here and it was a decent job. There's a lot of stocking (inventory) and good customer service is necessary. Some management was lackluster and some overcompensated.
good,"Party City was a good first job for an unexperienced young person who needs to learn the value of hard work, discipline, punctuality, and professionalism."
good,"It's fun to work there since it can be easy and calm sometimes, but it's also stressful when only 2 or 3 people work at a time and I have to run back and forth to do balloon orders, answer phones, and be on the cash register."
good,The job has a lot to deal with from lifting boxes to sweeping the store too mopping its a lot that comes with the job . You have to be patient with yourself to work there honestly its a lot of traffic in and out the store.
good,"I worked as floor associate and so I had to be on my feat, expect that. Customers were aggressive, especially the late shoppers. I got paid $9.75, so the pay was horrible!"
good,"A typical normal job, I learned many things, I worked there as a seasonal job for Halloween.The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customers with a smile on there face."
good,Fun place to work for during Halloween. Have the most options in party supplies in town. Closing is tough during Halloween because the customers leave everything anywhere in the store.
good,i was only season so i was not there long enough to really for a opinon it was a job that i needed at the time and as far as that goes it was ok just needed the money
good,It was okay for my first job. My general manager was not the nicest person and I had a couple bad managers. I always tried to make the best of my time there and was grateful my first job did not have to be in the food service.
good,"poor management, rude customers, not very lenient. needed more work hours but none were given. managers weren't easy going, but other than that it was fun"
good,For a first real retail experience it was a great job. There is unfortunately little advancement opportunities and is often stressful depending on the time of the year. Would recommend for a part time after school job.
good,"management could have been better and short lunch breaks, more workers, better pay for what they wanted us to do, better training for the managers and assistant managers"
good,party city is a great place to work. you will have tons of fun working around exciting people . this is a job where you will enjoy coming to work each day .
good,"I enjoyed working for Party City.  However, it was a seasonal position for a limited time and I am looking to grow with a company and learn new things."
good,"Went into work when scheduled help customers with Halloween outfits. Restocking, calling other stores seeing if a costume we did not have was in stock."
good,"They have a lots of party items. I think good environment, people are very nice, helping each other. They are good team work."
good,"It had some good days and bad days for the most party I enjoyed working at Party City. I learned everything at party I did it all. In management it was easy I open and close the store, I did computer work, count down the safe and tils, and I also did bank runs. The hardest part trying to get the employees do their job and staying on top of them and making sure they in their position. The most enjoyment of the job was helping the customers and making sure they leave the store satisfied and that put a smile on my smile face. I knew my job was well done."
good,Working at party city involved dealing with a lot of professional party planners and making sure that they got what they needed. I was also manager of the balloon counter and had to do both the till and the balloon orders
good,"A typical day at Halloween City involves a lot of customer interaction and merchandising. You will never run out of things to do during your shift. "
good,"i dont have much to say about this job, Party City. it was a fun environment dealing with many customers and got to work around fun energetic people. nice"
good,"It was very fun especially helping out people. The pay was good, the only thing is that there is always stuff to clean. The co workers were nice and pay was good."
good,"Boring job. Stocking shelves, picking up random party supplies over the store, organizing shipments. halloween was fun at party city but all the holidays after that were slow and boring."
good,"It was a good place to work over the years . "
good,came in worked on daily tasks assisted customers put freight away and recovered the store blew up balloons and completed balloon orders. managed cash and returns
good,"I didn't work at party city long enough to do this. Yes it was an amazing job, yes I had fun, yes everyone was nice but I was only there for a month due to it only being a seasonal job."
good,"It was a great job overall, fast paced, I learned a lot about becoming a manger. I met a lot of really great people. It was nice to meet and greet customers every morning. I had a better job opportunity therefore I left."
good,"It has been several years since I worked for this company, so creating an actual current review would not be appropriate. I can say that at the time I worked there, it was fast paced, but there were several office politics going on at the time. I do not know is that has changed since."
good,Workers were very chilled it was very fun looking at Halloween decorations but around Halloween it was really busy and super fast paced but job was only temporary
good,It IS a fun place to work if you like being imaginative and throwing parties. I've learned more about different blends of people than i have product i think. Its retail...
good,Fun place to work but not my career. Have to be flexible and know how to multi-task. It's a younger crowd environment. The atmosphere is great for young teens or college students.
good,"I enjoy party city as a corporation but have had bad experiences with my current managerial staff and that has forced me to leave. However, it is a fun place to. work when you don't have to deal with any drama."
good,Worked here only for the Halloween season with the costumes and being sold if I made only three more people buy costumes then i would of kept my job but unfortunately I haven't.
good,Nice place to work. There's a lot of moving but if you can do it it's not that bad. The staff is friendly and laid back. You just have to do your work.
good,Good management at regional level. Don't know about store level. Pay is low within the store construction arm of the company. Company appears to be going through growing pains as a result of rapid expansion.
good,Halloween can be very crazy but fun at the same time. Really good place if you are a party person and love to get stuff for the party. the rest of the year is kind of chill but still fast passed.
good,"i liked my co-workers and liked the pay, its a little difficult when its busy, but otherwise absolutely loved it. Great experience! great friendships made and will remember it for a long time!"
good,so this job was OK management was so so the schedule is great if you don't have kids and its a fun experience h.with that being said try your hand and maybe its a good fit for you
good,It is like every other retail job minus Black Friday sales. Management is not the most organized but they are good about giving days off when requested. Customers are a mix of good and bad. Some co-workers are extremely unprofessional but that varies with location.
good,"Working for a few locations, different managers both General and District. This is a company where standards differ based upon the motivation of the General Managers at each location. In my opinion it has always been the kind of company that very easily looks over Customer Service and Employee Satisfaction in favor of production."
good,"Not necessarily the greatest job, but I surely enjoyed giving customers the satisfaction of helping. Being able to learn the store made it easier for myself and helping others."
good,Co workers and managers are get to work for. Awesome place to work a little hectic during halloween but overall it was fun and enjoyable and meet different kinds of people.
good,"I enjoy working at party city but not high enough pay, I have a family to help support and I can't with the pay rate and the hours given, other then that its a great place fast pace some days others not so much."
good,"I would go to cashier and assist people, balloon area made sure evything is organized annd clean. People around me are nice and polite. Everyone has smiles."
good,"This job was very fun and exciting, my co-workers were awesome, and were always so nice. I loved getting to know all of our customers and making their day a good one!"
good,"Overall, the job could get complicated but it was easy going. Here is were I learned to attend customers for there needs. "
good,"Party city's work environment is tedious, but easy and manageable for anyone looking for an entry level job. Most of the time spent is cashier work, but during late September and all of October it's very exciting and quick paced."
good,"A typical day at work requires dealing with customers all day. Be a cashier and provide the best customer service you can. Help them with balloons, anything needed for a party or looking for something not in stores. Being a supervisor there is looking out for the associate and keeping them in check. Providing them with new information and everyday duty."
good,average day at work was constant unloading of trucks and stocking shelves while ringing up sales. most hated time of year was around october with costume sales
good,"A typical day consists of helping customers with purchases, inflating balloons and recovering the store's isles."
good,"Must be a team player, open to new ideas, pay attention to detail, multitask, customer service, answer phones, know the company policies, hardworking, goal oriented individuals, opportunity to move up within the company."
good,"The managers are low quality and are often switched out. Due to the location the customers are a hassle, and are very rude. The store is extremely dirty as well. Honestly, the only reason I have stayed so long is because some of the employees make it bearable."
good,"The co-workers and management are great (for the most part) "
good,"I started this job with no previous work experience and it was a pretty good starter job. I did not like the manager and a few of the coworkers, as they were inappropriate almost all the time, but it was a pretty okay job."
good,"Hard to take off for personal days, not flexible with the scheduling. Employees were teenagers and managers were older people. You would never know where you would be placed for the day."
good,"Party city is a fun & easy environment to work at , the week days are slow pace but when the weekend hits it's starts to get a lot busy , that's how it is working at party city"
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job: helping people get ready for their event."
good,"Halloween city helped me with my communication skills, also helped me manage money at the register at a quick pace. I would recommend anyone to work here around that time"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of being a cashier for most of the shift. If another employee were to come in after the start of my shift, then I would start to stock the shelves or clean the store. The workplace culture is great as long as you do not let the customers or management bother you."
good,This is about my 9th working at that place and I feel as if that I haven't work that much because I was off for almost a month. The only thing that they need to change the hours that is being needed for the employees.
good,"Only seasonal job"
good,I would recommend Party City as a start off job. I say this because when I worked there in the beginning it was ok and easy to do. Towards the end of me working there everything spiraled out of control. I wouldn't recommend this job for someone to go to for a serious career job. Not to mention I had an accident to where I was on crutches and couldn't work ...they fired me without me knowing.
good,its an ok place to work. no hours off season only get hours during Halloween/Christmas seasons not a good place to work for if you are looking to grow in the company just a temporary job until you find something better
good,Party City was nice to work at. It was a nice environment with good employees that were easy to get along with. It was a part-time gig for me as I was a student and needed some source of income. Good for students.
good,A typical day at work is helping guest find what they are looking for and things to add to their party.  Manage employees.  Count draws and make deposits.
good,Adapted well to the environment and enjoyed learning my way around the job. Most of my coworkers and managers were excellent and easy to get along with.
good,This place was dead most of the time so shifts went by slowly with not many customers entering the store. Besides that I liked working with my co-workers who were kind and nice.
good,I only worked at Party City for a short time but I enjoyed the atmosphere there. All my coworkers were nice and helped me out in the beginning when I was still learning.
good,"After you clock in, the boss tells you what to do for the shift and when you are done, he assigns you to do something else. Also if you are working during Halloween then you will be handling out the costumes."
good,Party City is a great organization to learn the essentials to customer service. The basic knowledge gained during this job will be beneficial in learning how to work with customers and good customer service.
good,"Party City"
good,a lot of work is involved working for this company. minimum sales goals are required. a lot of store recovery that takes 4 hours to complete every night. always have to redecorate and set up new displays for every season and holiday and event days.
good,"restructuring not a good time , too many layoffs but with severance, spend too much on companies not in US. very heavy in debt will see more change in following months and years."
good,I only wish that I was given training for the cash register. Most days I was given the same work to do as the previous. The hardest part was doing freight work. The most enjoyable part I'd say was being in a friendly environment.
good,"I worked at party city part time as a Team Leader. A typical day included working the cash register, distributing jobs to other employees, and helping managers with odd tasks. Overall i liked the job. I enjoyed managing a small group of employees who knew they could trust me and ask me for help with no judgement. The management was good and would work the floor when needed.There were bad aspects though, a lack of advancement in the company and poor pay as well as hours."
good,"fun atmosphere, seasonal store that encourages creative and fun work environment with great employee discounts too bad it's only open a short amount of time."
good,"Party City was an alright place to work. It got pretty busy during the Halloween season but was manageable. The store required of me to find costumes, clean shelves of merchandise and help people with finding things that they need."
good,Loved working with the customer getting the right outfit for Halloween.  A great overall environment to work in.  I learned how to build a store from the ground up and then remove it after Halloween.
good,It is a great place to learn new things and people. The co- worker's there are nice they make you feel like u at home. I would tell anyone that this is a good work place.
good,"Being a manger I have learned time management, how to help customers with any type of need they have, and how to help build up a good associate team. The hardest part of the job would be around Halloween time (our biggest season) and trying to prevent people from stealing our costumes and preventing shrink during that season. The most enjoyable part of the job is doing balloons on a busy Saturday. Also, being assigned a ""zone"" (a section of the store) that I am responsible for is my favorite. I like keeping everything looking nice and making sure the planograms are up to date."
good,Definitely more party for less. Its like working in the worlds largest Party factory.  Has everything you never knew you wanted and needed for a party.
good,"This job was seasonal and they did inform me that it was but they also told me they might keep me. What was unexpected was that i went in for my normal shift and then before I could start they let me go because the season was over no notice before nothing. Also, managers there always put the work on everyone else and don't really help much. But I did love the work enviornent it was always upbeat and fun!"
good,"A typical day a work is extremely fast paced and customer oriented. I have learned to multitask a lot, because we have to answer the phone while cashing out customers. There is nothing too hard about it but at work we can deal with ballons."
good,A few of my coworkers were unprofessional on an every day basis. My managers really didn't use the authority that they had to get the company store branch in order.
good,"-great management"
good,Management expected things that were impossible. Management NEVER helped always sat in the back and did nothing but give orders. We always got out an hour after if not longer than our scheduled time to leave. The pay is absolutely horrible for all the work you do and all the rude customers you put up with.
good,"Improvements could be made with management attitude towards employees. "
good,"The store itself was great, the boss of the store manager ( regional manager ) was .. I'd say not cut out for the job to put it nicely. Things were a bit chaotic at times due to his selfishness."
good,Some days will consist of packaging items and some days will consist of not doing plenty of work. It was convenient and easy to get there. Other days it was busy but still manageable.
good,"My time with this company was very short. It was during the Halloween season, which is the busiest time at this store. My coworkers were great to work with."
good,"Once hired, whether it's for part-time or seasonal, everyone is considered seasonal once the Halloween season rolls around and everyone is at jeopardy of losing their jobs. Towards the end of the Halloween season when people start getting laid off, it becomes stressful and you fear for your job. I lost my job to people who had been their for two months while I was there for nine, the store manager who decides who goes and who stays is sexist, letting most of the men go, six of which were on the same day. The store manager releases the schedule late into the week, sometimes it's early, getting released on a Thursday but most times the schedule is released late Friday early Saturday. It's really difficult to make plans for future dates when you don't find out what days you work until the very end of the week."
good,Overall Experience I Don't think it's a very professional job everyone seems to do what they like and not what their told to much favor in the store instead of business conduct so I can say I wouldn't go back to the university party city ever again.
good,"opening paper work, banking, read e-mails, write duties for the day for employees, work on tasks assigned for day, shipping and receiving and freight, sign in vendors, sales and cashier, training, hiring, recovery in the store thru out the day, etc."
good,"a typical day at work consists of assisting customers in a timely manner,running register,stocking shelves.Management was very involved.Coworkers were very friendly"
good,"I love working there. It's an amazing place, great people and you are always busy. You gotta be fast ato blowing up balloons though on weekends it's very busy  so you have to be quick but good and they are well at teaching too."
good,Overall a decent place to work. Expectations vs payroll are not quite in balance. The large amount of seasonal / holiday resets can be chaotic.
good,"neat store, only very busy around Halloween, ,store always was messy, managers were nice. never had a lot of hours unless it was halloween."
good,good place to work work well with everyone managment was good nice and very helpful always welling to help everyone  easy place to work at some time hard when planing party for friends and falimly
good,"Typical day at work would be stocking up/down merchandises and make space. Pretty slow, occasionally. They would make us just walk around even if there wasn't any customers in store."
good,"Hard work, but a very enjoyable work environment. It doesnt get too stressful, but keeps you busy enough to pass the time"
good,"Always a busy work day, especially during holiday seasons."
good,I helped customers find the perfect halloween costume and decorations for parties. Whether I was in the back room finding costumes or out on the floor it was overall a great experience.
good,"A typical day at work here is actually pretty fun. Sometimes it can get busy but it still has a nice overall feel to it. They pay wasn't bad starting, and had I not moved and had to change jobs it felt like I could have moved into a supervisor position pretty easily."
good,"Most Co workers and managers would talk about each other to other employees. Someone always had their nose in someone's business, some employees are rude."
good,"Great, fun place to work. Fun and fun learning all about their products."
good,"Great managment team, Fun place to work at if it was your fist job. Balloons get annoying after a white but one gets use to it. Holloween hours are great."
good,"work was steady i learned how to read planagrammes and reading shipping records. management was great until the new store manager arrived, my co-workers where great people and fun to work with and i loved the physical labor parts of the job"
good,always people messing up the store but it was always fun to clean the store while playing with the items in the store. Easy job to organize the store and put it back how it was
good,"Nice place to work, the people I worked with and the customers were great. The only downside to working at Party City is the hours and pay.  I only worked part-time and for minimum wage."
good,"Comfortable workplace that made me feel responsible, however management could have been better. My co-workers were fun and everyone got along well, there wasn't a hard part about the job it was fairly simple."
good,"There was no typical day at work in this job because it was retail there were multiple different tasks especially considering what season it is. The busiest, hardest, and most enjoyable season is halloween which the store is most known for. I had the opportunity to work for three halloweens, was only temporary until they decided to keep me for the other seasons. This temporary job turned into my longest job and I like it very much. I learned many new things that will stay with me while working for other companies in the future."
good,"I learned how to get there on time and learning how to cooperate with the managers and workers also how to work with customers by use my phone, lip-reading, or hand gesture. I am deaf."
good,"Unless you have superhuman patience and energy, I wouldnt suggest working during the halloween season. Put it this way, i worked one day from 11 am to 4 am the next day."
good,"Fun and creative environment to work in. Seasonal jobs are the best, received great overtime hours, as well as great overtime time. However, management was not the best it could be."
good,"I worked the register and after you learned how to do it, it was a very easy job. It was a good first job and the experience looked good to move on to bigger and better things."
good,its was an interesting job. Fast paced and always busy. Mix of good and bad customers but thats every business. Always changing stock so you have to be quick on your feet
good,"The most enjoyable part is working with my team mates especially, New faces or people I know from school. Having the job done gets the day over with."
good,I enjoyed my time at the workplace. The co-workers were friendly and the managers were easy to talk to. Overall a pleasent experience.
good,"they are nice"
good,"There is a lot of work to be done regarding Party City's organization, communication and amount of benefits available to you."
good,"This is a fun job to have if your still in school, and just need something extra to do or need a little extra cash. It's diverse and you meet a lot of fun, and interesting people."
good,It was good working there although work was temporary so it came and went and you had certain opportunities open up. It was nice working there although work wasn't really constant.
good,I would come in and help fulfill balloon orders while helping customers at the same time. I learned how to multitask and handle difficult customers.
good,"I was a cashier ,i took the payments for the merchandise in the store , i made sure the customers were satified with what they were able to find."
good,I really enjoyed working at party city I was working there as a seasonal working but once the seasonal position was over I wasn't aware of what to do I thought the professional way to handle it would be to bring it to all seasonal workers attentions on when would they last day be beside just taking us off the schedule I was upset cause I was assured my job but I was even more upset the manger didn't bring it to my attention I found out because coworkers would gossip and when I called the store I could never get in touch with the manager which was very unprofessional but overall it was a wonderful experience and if I can do it again I would just didn't like how they handle certain things.
good,"Though working in retail is much nicer than my previous food job, there's little respect. Shift leaders are generally nice but the general managers are extremely unprofessional, accusatory, and disrespectful to any and all staff. The work however, is no issue. Cleaning, customer service, and pushing freight isn't difficult or tedious."
good,"Left due to pregnancy, everything and everyone was very nice and understanding about everything any time there was a problem."
good,"There is not much to be said for a steady income, health insurance benefits, and other necessities. ... If you know you detest your work and will not be happy in a similar job, it's time to ...you wont find them here"
good,"Placing orders for events (Balloons, D√©cor, Candy)"
good,They had some nice managers. It was a lot of fun when they would allow us to dress up practically everyday till Halloween during October.
good,"cleaning and helping customers"
good,"I loved working here especially in the Halloween season. I have worked on Cashier, Stocker, and receiving and they very responsible positions. There wasn't anything hard from working there, I loved it."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers to find costumes and other party items.  Also the co-workers were helpful in pitching in when we would be in a crunch.
good,"Got to look at great stuff while working there, lots of fun. Balloon orders were a bit difficult to learn, but all in all a great place"
good,This job ws very fun. Working during all the holidays will make you very excited. It will be very boring at time when no holidays are coming up.
good,"Easy everyday tasks. Enjoyable customer service experience. Enjoyable co-workers. Enough hours and employees scheduled per shift, especially during their busy period of Halloween."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Decent co-workers, that are helpful and understand when you have a bad day at work. In overall the job was a okay experience."
good,"I believe that the company as a whole has some flaws, however, there are really great people, challenging work, and a good sense of responsibility."
good,It was a nice experience to work at Party City. Especially working during Halloween time. Me and my coworkers had fun and still did our work at the same time.
good,"Only worked here for a few months in a seasonal position in a Halloween pop up store.  The employees were fine the work was ok not too bad for my first job.  Learned register, helped clean the store and assist the guests."
good,was a good job but didnt like the hours i liked it that it was on the bus and i liked helping customers the mangers waere nice and the pay wasnt that good
good,"Good place to have as a first job, very fast paced but can be a very fun environment. Managers focus on store displays and customer satisfaction."
good,"A lot of picking up after messy children, little to no training, very misinformed last minute employees. Not my favorite job."
good,"This is a fun and easy job for young people. Typical day at work putting up inventory, ringing out customers merchandise, blowing up balloon orders, and HALLOWEEN time = crazy busy madness, but makes the shift go by fast."
good,"A typical day at work usually revolves around helping customers find party supplies and ideas to make their party.  A good majority of your time on the weekend is spent blowing up balloons. Day to day activities include pushing freight, merchandising, and endless recovery as well as put backs.  Store management is required to work a 50 hr week.  Manager is salaried, EA and AM are hourly.  Halloween is our Christmas, we are extremely busy and usually ramp up staffing to 40+ pt associates.  Company rule NO DOWN TIME!  You always need to keep busy, there is always something to do.  I would say the most fun is usually helping customers put their party together, decorations, balloons, favors etc."
good,"Greeted customers and assisted them with merchandise selections."
good,A good company to work with but advancement in the company is very slow paced.All the decisions regarding management is decided by regional manager or corporate
good,"It is an enjoyable work environment where an employee can learn multiple skills in areas such as working the cash registers or working on the sales floor. The coworkers are mostly high school students, so sometimes management has to remind them that they are in a professional place of work. The hardest part of the job is doing planograms, which is basically making sure you set up product following detailed sheets. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work at the balloon counter, because it is a continuous and repetitive area of the job. Advancement is not easy, and hours are terrible. After a few years of a work, some employees are only getting one 4-6 hour shift a week."
good,I learned to work well with others and be a good team player. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working with the employees and being able to get along with them all.
good,"Requires a lot of product moving with every change of season, and when new product comes in, up and down tall ladders, few employees to handle the load."
good,"Was only Seasonal, got good hours, decent pay. Heavy Customer Service interaction. Improved overall skills in Retail."
good,"Being a manager at Party City is hard work and most of that work goes un-noticed. The work is never ending but that In turn means it is never boring. Party City can be a fun place to work and they promote relatively fast but once you become a Team Lead and then MAYBE an asst. Manager, there is really no where else to go. I had a co-worker who was an asst. manager for 14 years and the hardest worker I had ever met and still no promotion. Party City plays favorites and if you are not one of them you are SOL. They also highly underpay for the work that is involved in the job."
good,If you didn't work here around halloween then you would agree that it was very boring no work to do just walk around and look for customers and ask if they need help. Management was very good though they made sure everything was done if there was anything to do.
good,"A typical day at work included interacting with both child and adult customers, meeting customer satisfaction, sharing knowledge about our products and keeping a positive attitude."
good,Working at Party City was fun only cause it was Halloween but I really didn't talk to anybody . The management was bad  far as them changing schedules and not telling you. The hardest part was the balloon orders but it was a nice place to work at.
good,Typical day insists of stocking items and making sure everything is where it needs to be. Help costumers when they cannot find an item. Co-workers are very fun and talkative. Hardest part is closing and the most enjoyable part is weekend mornings.
good,It was a little stressful to try to give every costumer the costume they wanted but we always try to give the costumer what they want.
good,At Party City i worked as a stock clerk. Most of my duties consisted of stocking merchandise and cleaning the store. The work was very easy and i was able to accomplish my tasks daily. The most difficult days we're when we would get product shipments but that was still pretty easy. The most enjoyable part was working with some great co-workers and helping each other to get jobs done.
good,I wasnt so comfortable working here. coworkers were snobby and managers showed favoritism. i learned how to multitask. The hardest part of  this job was coming to work everyday.
good,"I was not at this job for long but while I was there it was a great place to work, helped a lot of customers. There was not really anything hard about working here"
good,"There store I am currently employed at is a franchise, therefore there is little room for advancement and the owners can terminate you just for the heck of it. Advice: if you're looking occupational advancement, steer clear of franchises."
good,"There is always work to do to keep you busy."
good,Typically work both as a cashier and stocker. Learn how to blow up balloons and change the helium tanks out when they are empty and handle damaged goods.
good,the environment your in from the minute you walk in to the second you leave is amazing. awesome energy and real support from the party city team making sure each customers experience is an enjoyable one.
good,I hated working here because the management team was awful  It was my first job and I knew more about running the company than they did.  I never made one error on the register
good,"A typical day at work at party city is being on the register, helping customers on the sales floor, and doing go-backs and straightening the store."
good,party city was an exciting and fun job.. something new to look forward to everyday .. I went out my way to dress up with accessories daily  .. witch was required but not enforced.. took the corporation sales over the top with my initiative to sales accessories because I knew that is how the store made its profit.. with not getting paid commission I just love to see people happy and excited about their customs .. all to still get laid off after the season was over
good,Would be a great place to work if consistant hours were given
good,I greeted shoppers and secured the grounds to make it safe for customers. I enjoyed working there and assisting customers with their items if needed.
good,"Enjoyed serving customers. "
good,"The first two weeks was spent setting up the store and once opened the typical day was spent assisting customers with purchases, returns and exchanges. This was my first retail job so I learned a lot about proper customer service skills from middle management. Management was the strongest part of store since it was seasonal and we had to really focus to get things up and running. All my coworkers at Halloween City were a lot of fun which helped with the nature of the store. The hardest part of the job was the huge sales in the week prior to Halloween. I mostly enjoy the fun oriented atmosphere."
good,"Working at Party City was something different for me. Everyone was very friendly and easy to get along with. A typical work day for me was unloading a truck, separating and putting out freight. When i became the team lead, i had more responsibilities but i enjoyed it."
good,I worked here when i was in high school and learned to handle people who are rude.
good,"Guiding customers to costume ideas, stocking shelves, cashier work."
good,"very busy place, I learned how to use helium tanks. Hardest part of the job was standing on your feet for more then 6 hours."
good,Fun environment but completely unorganized. Also the pay is horrible
good,"I learned customer skills."
good,"A typical day at work is Cleaning up the store, making sure the costumer needs assistance"
good,"great for a first job. learned a lot with all their training for future jobs, very thorough training and great structure."
good,Very well functioning store organized correctly. Productive systems keeping things moving.
good,"te deja creatividad a la hora de exponer la mercancia, buen ambient de trabajo en general"
good,Co-workers and Management were friendly.  Party City is a good first job.
good,It was awesome to get o work in a Halloween store and help people create their own style of Halloween costumes. It was cool to work with the customers just to see their face when you gave them helpful tips on how they cold do their makeup or what would look good with what. It was amazing to see the kids smiling faces when they walked in the door.
good,grewt way to learn about events. great team of co workers. awesome place to start.
good,"A typical day of work was not so typical at all. I could be inside the store stacking shelves or helping customers, or outside in a Gumby costume waving at cars."
good,"I would go to work right after school and my manager would instruct me what needed to be done.  I would do my part and pick up the slack of the other workers that were just taking their time.  It was difficult work because there were a lot of parents trying to get a costume for their kids who where acting up and not paying attention or running around.  Also, combined with other parents trying to get the same costume and there were only a few left, so tempers flared a few times.  I did like that the day flew by because we were very busy, but I didn't like the fact that we didn't get take very many breaks because it was so busy."
good,"Really fun place to work."
good,"It was nice and inviting. Everyone was cool and chilled. Management was okay, was being a manager I guess. No breaks is given, be on your feet throughout the day, if its busy enough, ask you overtime. As well it was flexible and able to get through the day."
good,Definitely needs improvement. I was looking for a business i could work my way up in the company. This was not available to me.
good,"I learned how to operate a cash register using cash and credit/debit card, how to properly handle customer complaints, how to keep a consistently organized and clean appearance of the store and how to prevent customers from having any discomfort or dissatisfaction with the service provide. The most enjoyable part of the job is connecting with customers and creating an enjoyable shopping experience with them. The hardest part of the job was having to learn how to constantly multitask and how to deal with the pressure of running back and forth in a fast paced environment for more than 6 hours. The management is very helpful and are willing to help me learn for my mistakes. Most of my co-workers are easy to get along with and very friendly."
good,"Very structure environment, planning is a must and needs to be a effective leader."
good,"-Excellent practice of customer service"
good,"Had Fun, Fast Pace, Great Company To Work For, Especially As A Youth‚Ä¶."
good,Stock associate for holiday months. Unloading and loading trucks and storage also.
good,Party city was a great first job and work experience.Party city taught me a lot about the work force that helped me with my future employers.
good,"Management appreciates you and notices your skills. Very fun and exciting environment, especially around halloween."
good,"I worked for this company for almost 5 years, no room for advancement."
good,Great seasonal job for high school students. easy money and met alot of people.
good,I loved working here during Halloween that way I could wear a costume to work.
good,I learned how to managed the registers & multiple things abt customers & store.some co workers are cooperative.work on planograms alone & balloon orders especially on weekdays are the hardest part of the job.working with team.
good,A typical day at work would be making sure the store was picked up and product was back on the shelves. I learned how to handle a stressful work place can be crazy but it can go smooth if you work as a team. My co-workers were great people very friendly.
good,"Hire fast, fire faster. Regional management is confusion and place stress on local management and employees. "
good,"Started off as a receiver within 6 months promoted to Assistant Manager. I was in charge of the whole store: money, customers, employees, and ordering."
good,A typical day consisted of stocking shelves and consulting customers on their needs.
good,"Working at Party City for me was only a seasonal job at first. It was only to be a temporary position, though going more and more into the workforce I was hoping to become more than a seasonal position. They aren't bad people, my seasonal co-workers and I had all gotten along with each other fairly well. The regular employees (mainly those left in charge) weren't however. They had seemed to look down upon us, maybe it was because we were only seasonal. One thing I hadn't liked was the lack of information. None of us were told how long the seasonal position would last, and as soon as the season was over we were all let go immediately with no warning. The season was Halloween; on November 1st upon going in, all I was told that ""You may or may not get one extra shift from the general manager. Try calling and take your chances"", I learned later on that a company may let employees go without any warning. However, everyone was under the impression that we would at-least stay until after the holidays, not a month or two just for Halloween. "
good,"its a fun working enviroment but they don't give you enough hours. It is pretty fun to interact with customers, but is not always the case"
good,"Typical day at work- check in and get to work, named called on the radio, restock items on shelf or reported to the picture wall."
good,learned how to me fast paced and how to give great customer service. It was never a boring day.
good,Overall Party city was a good place to work at. Most of the time we I was given a task to complete by the end of my shift. My co-workers were nice but the manager of the store was not very nice to the co-workers and treated us poorly.
good,"A typical day of work may consist of drama within employees or customers, not always but it has its moments very often. Throughout my experience there I've learned how to work with many different types of people and how to learn how to get along with one another. The hardest part of my job would have to be the commute back and forth to work and school, at times it just doesn't feel worth it."
good,It's a rather enjoyable place to work if you do what you have to do. Trying not to let customers get under your skin is a bit of a challenge but the nicer customers make up for a pleasant experience. Not a bad place to work...
good,"cluttered store"
good,Great place to work.  Very fun and energetic.  Able to interact with customers to are planning a party.
good,This location was constantly busy. It has its pros and cons.
good,"It's a great place to work if you're just starting to work. The pay is low and as for raises, you can't expect more than 20 cents. Depending on the store, I suppose it could be more, but my store was fairly small. Rush seasons are later in the year, but it can be slow during the summer. Some of the managers were awesome, but more likely to just dictate. Best thing about the job was discount on products"
good,"Helped customers"
good,"Even thou it was a part time little job, I had a lot of fun working for this company especially during the holidays!"
good,I like working for company fun and laud back environment. Employees should get more hours
good,"Separating, entering and delivering mail and documents. Entering Sales sheets for eastern franchise stores Daily."
good,Working for this company has given me the chance to grow with the company. Learned a lot within all the years having worked for this company. The hardest part of the job is not having enough hours to be able to do so much. Time management is key in this company. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work with so many different kinds of people that you can learn from especially in south Florida.
good,Nicely paced work environment. Great for high school or college student looking for part-time work. 
good,"its a good place to work its a fun inviorment, managers are some of the best i have ever worked with "
good,"I was an Intern at party city, I was working there October when everyone would come and get their costumes. It was a great experience helping customers with their costumes and deciding what to get. You have to multitask with getting the costume number and telling the other person to get it and the size. Overall the staff was great to work with. "
good,"Great atmosphere, minimum wage, if your seasonal and got kept on full time your good to go."
good,"‚Ä¢	Maintaining an accurate register count "
good,"Working at Party City was a great Experience. I had multiple responsibilities. Working there, was always a challenge for me. There wasn't a challenge I wasn't able to overcome."
good,I help assist customers with custom banners and invitations. Also help with finding merchandise that fits there party needs. I learned there program that is used to make the banners and invites. Also how to provide excellent customer service. I enjoy working with my co-workers. We all get along really well. The thing I enojoy most is being able to help people and meeting new people every single day.
good,"I enjoy working , taking on new responsibilities and progressing towards an career financially ."
good,"PT nights & Weekends"
good,A typical work day would begin a 9am. I learned that keeping customers happy is the main focus and getting them the things they need and want. 
good,"i hated this place so much, i was only working here because my mom liked me working with her. but the drama was worse than high school."
good,good place to work during high very flexiable with the schedule
good,Assisted customers to the costume wall. The most difficult part of this job was angry customers
good,"like my old job at macy's its was not my perferred choice but i took it for what it was, it helped get me through school"
good,This job was not the cat's pajama's. Boring job really. Nothing too bad about it though.
good,A fun atmosphere and to work at and I enjoy working with different kinds of people.
good,Helping customers find costumes also getting their accesories that they needed for their costumes.
good,"Help customers pick out costumes, dress up in a different costume every shift, climb ladders to get merchandise, restock, check the fitting rooms, help children get dressed up and pick out their Halloween costumes. Hardest part of my day was dealing with angry customers who either wanted deals or pieces of costumes would be missing. The most enjoyable was being able to dress up and be in the spirit of Halloween."
good,"Customer service is a fun thing to deal with, never know what you'll get next. But Party City and their managers are just over their head with their egos. It's a very simple job, and to be belittled and questioned if I could complete a task is not rewarding. Co-workers are great, we always have a wonderful time."
good,"A typical day at work was answering phone calls, mainly balloon orders for the weekend, setting up orders for the weekend, along with assisting customers for their festivities."
good,its a really great productive and learning work place drama free and i loved coming to work .
good,"Seasonal job, a lot of hours, great enviorment. Fast paced, a good place to develop customer skills."
good,"I was an Executive Associate Manager. A typical day for me required opening up the store, make sure all employees knew what they had to do for the day. I would also create the schedules for all employees. I would read the e-mails from corporate every couple of hours. Be in charge of the shipments that were received. Help customers with any questions. Check on the safe four times a day. I also filled out General Paperwork."
good,This store has everything you would ever need for any type of party all year round!
good,"they expect more than they give, and you are not paid well. I was a store manager during the halloween season. district and regional managers offer support but its more critical that supportive"
good,Management staff was very poor..they never had a set schedule and would always call you in about an hour or two before they needed you in. Head manager never finished a job and was lazy and really bossy. She was unabe to deal with fast pace action during our weekend rush hours
good,"I tihkn it's your basical retail job, but you come across interesting products and the customers are generally upbeat."
good,"My typical work day would be to come in and open up store. turn on all appliances. what I have learned was to be more patient with the customers and how to handle angry customers with a smile. My managers weren't so great to deal with. Co-Workers were ok, days went by quick with a great day and felt accomplished .I believe the hardest part of the job was handling the angry customer. the most enjoyable parts of the job are the benefits and discounts. and meeting new people"
good,"I met different people everyday, and got to help customers with their needs."
good,"A typical day when I worked at Halloween City was rushed. Especially in the dressing room area, people would want to try on their costume before purchasing, but most were in a hurry. Employees needed to take the costume out of the package and inspect it before letting the customer try it on, which took time and only one employee was working in the dressing room area. Busy, and rushed."
good,"A typical day would consist of go-backs, customer service, running costumes, and stocking shelves. I learned how to multi-task better and dealing with multiple customers at once. My co-workers were amazing people who turned out to be really great friends. They were there when I needed help or had any questions and overall they welcomed me ina very friendly manner. The hardest part of the job was around Halloween when there were a large amount of customers and not enough employees. The whole job experience was enjoyable and a great learning experience."
good,"Working at halloween city was a challenge but I love challenges. One thing I loved about working at halloween city is the customer, helping them pick a costume brings out so much character and personality. It was fun working with co-workers because we all work as a team to find the best costume for our customer. The hardest part about the job is when customer shop the day before halloween , things can be kinda hectic."
good,"Maintained the stores accuracy number of costumes by calling to the back and releasing the customer to pick it up. Maintained the cleanliness of the store as well as answer phones and make calls over the intercom. I got many hours and management was great but unfortunately, being seasonal I wasn't able to show how well I can work compared to others who have had much more experience."
good,"This was a temporary seasonal store for which I was responsible for the receiving of and set-up of all fixtures and merchandise. Handled all staffing, scheduling and training of staff and daily operation. Also, supervised the inventory, pack-up and return of all left-over merchandise and fixtures to the home warehouse."
good,"This position expanded and utilized a wide variety of my talents. From freight and merchandise handling, staff supervision, as well as playing a key roll in a complete store remodel."
good,halloween is a great holiday to work at party city you get to help all kind of people and ages
good,"Typical day at work was always fun, got along with everyone, enjoyed customers, fast paced but everyoe worked great togehter"
good,"Stock and inventory, Customer"
good,hands on costomers
good,"A typical day at work would include helping customers, answering phones, cash register, and planning new layouts within the store. I learned quickly that no matter where you work, there are always going to be lazy people. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with pleasant customers who truly appreciated your hard work."
good,Fun place to work. not the best pay. long hours. Nice co-wrokers and laid back work environment.
good,The co-workers from this job are pretty efficent at completing a task though can be proven to not be dependable depending on what type of people you hire. It is a pretty fun job but you can be expected to do the work of 2 men becuase of the shortage of hours they tend to have unless its around hallowwen time.
good,"It was okay, the managers didn't really do their jobs well. Also the other workers were mostly lazy."
good,ive leraned how to handel cash answer heavy phone lines . its a fun enviroment .
good,Organize and process weekly inventory supplies in stock room and store floor
good,"Its a growing company, good people to work with. You get to deal with lots of different people. The hardest part of the job is growing pains, the company is changing fast and there is lots of change"
good,This job was fun to work at. Good part time job for a student and is fun for the most part. Picks up a lot during the Halloween season and slows down for the most part for the rest of the year.
good,I think out of all the job's I've had. Party city was actually fun cause it was pretty much helping people out with picking a costume. Especially the little kids.
good,Love training my team and being there leader.. I‚Äôm very motivated and Determine. I Enjoy Making Other Laugh.. And I Always Have The Passion to Serve..
good,There is a lot of internal theft and unfollowed procedures. There are people who are logging into management roles who are not managers (know managers codes).
good,"Cash people out, help customers, inflate balloons. Hardest part was when they wanted to use a coupon and it doesnt apply to what they are buying. When they wanted the manager and they told the customer the same thing I did, I would feel like customers didnt trust me when I answered them cause I was a normal employee."
good,"If I had the right support and training I will have the advancement and opportunity to get ahead, unfortunately the regional manager had other plans that is not particularly the company's best interest"
good,"Not enough hours, friendly staff,great people, management is helpful, everyone is willing to help you and teach you how to do anything there. Work is easy to understand"
good,It was a short job but decent one. I didn't work long hours which kinda sucked but my peers were all very nice and so was my manager overall it was a good work experience for me.
good,"Management was a bit iffy. Supervisor cared more about how he looked to his uppers instead of worrying about the employees. If you want something done (like time off) you have to constantly remind them to put it in. Other than poor management, it was an easy job. I loved my coworkers."
good,"The flexible scheduling is nice and there is paid time off, however the pay is pretty bad and nearly impossible to get a raise. The hours are also not that great- corporate never gives us enough, so you really need a second job because it is not reliable."
good,"Their expectations were unrealistic and if completed task they never would acknowledge the good job we did only the bad.  The manager was very rude and a time she would speak to employees like they were 2yrs old, no professional at all."
good,Managers were rude and disrespectful to employees and customers and the pay was too low. I worked seasonal but I think they should higher the pay rate especially during the fast paced season.
good,Working during peak season allowed many diferent options availble for warehouse work. I was a picker and was able to walk around 10 miles per workday.
good,"I got employed as a seasonal store manager, so everything was expected to be fast and without errors, which could be 100% achievable with a at least some training. I was lucky enough to have a GREAT staff during those 3 months, so everything worked out fine. Payment was good. Hours could be better. There's room for improving the communication and management for the District."
good,"Blowing up balloons can be really fun. Other than that if you are not a manager and its not Halloween, you might not get that many hours. Sometimes its only managers working because there isn't enough hours for the sales associates. This can be a pain because if only 2 people in the store and there is a line at the register and balloon counter then customers on the floor get mad because they can't be helped right away."
good,"It was alright for a seasonal job, but I wouldn't have stayed and I don't think I'd go back. It was fun, however, though the hours sometimes felt long when there was no one in the store"
good,overall it was a fun place to work T. blowing balloons for different events were the best part. I learned that you have to have great customer service and that the customer is always right
good,"its a fun place to work at to start off for something better. you learn lots, and have fun with halloween time when that comes about. its a great company."
good,My negative experience with Party City is mainly based off poor management and scheduling which was never very organized. Co-workers were great people to work with. Job itself was a lot of running around to different areas of the store.
good,"Only beneficial as a part time job due to the lack of business when its not holiday season. I seemed to find myself wandering the store, since I had already stocked the shelves and had no customers to help."
good,"it isn't much but its a job, there is plenty to do at party city, the job can keep you on your toes. if you have school it can be  resolved with a manager, if a schedule is to late or  to early."
good,"Although i only worked for the Halloween season my time at party city was a very enjoyable experience the management when i was working there was on the ball every time and at no point did i question their decisions, one thing that i did not really enjoy was just how much standing there was however that is also only one complaint aside from that the job wasn't bad it certainly was a tad overwhelming on the first day but for learning everything that was expected a typical day was going around asking customers if they needed help finding or getting certain items along with giving them info on what they were looking to know. Overall Party City is a decent place to work it can be relaxed or quick paced depending on what days your working but it was never too bad."
good,I was a seasonal sales associate at Party City and it was overall a good experience for me. I would highly recommend working here. The management are well mannered and makes your typical day at work fun.
good,This is a great first job for anyone looking for there first place of employment. Once you move up the ladder of management you see how ridiculous and stressful working here really is. A rigorous work schedule which is never consistent and demanding physical work. The higher ups honestly don't know what the in store employees go through. Furthermore the hard work goes unnoticed. Quite depressing when your giving it your all to meet there flat out absurd expectations.
good,"The first year is great, but it becomes mundane and the management is rocky. There is room for growth to certain extent. A good first job to have but explore other places."
good,Party city corporation was very chill not much business besides for the halloween season. Really the only time it gets busy. Loved working during halloween and helping guest with costumes
good,"Pretty easy job, fun environment, great for part-time employment. A lot of things to keep you busy like stocking shelves and unpacking merchandise. Good management but lack of hours available and strict policy about overtime."
good,"I started at Party City during the Halloween season, (one of the most busiest seasons as the year) as a ""cross trained"" seasonal employee. My job consisted of me working the cash register at the front, keeping the area clean, fulfilling balloon orders over the phone as well as in person. When not on the register I would be on the floor stocking or overstocking, which just meant making sure the pegs were fully stocked with products. There was also the ""costume wall"" where you would stand assisting customers with their questions and requests. Working at party city helped me learn what it was like multitasking and how to do it efficiently."
good,"a typical day at party city is helping customers, ringing them up, blowing up balloons , cleaning. I would say working at party city is a unique place to work. It is always busy and I learned to be quick on my feet."
good,"company sets unrealistic goals. Company willing admits it doesn't give stores the proper payroll but expects everything completed still. Company under estimated the payroll needs of the stores, refused to adjust then created new positions at regional levels."
good,"I worked here over the Halloween period, it was a temporaty job. Very stressful, you will deal with angry parents and a lot of unhappy people who come last minute and realize we have no costumes left. Overall you will close around 11 on a school night o if you have no problem with that go ahead and work here."
good,There wasn't anything fun or entertaining about working at Party City because if was a very uptight place. People walked around with plain faces and there was not really any type of enjoyment working there except a woman who had a car filled with food.
good,I loved working at party city. but It got harder for me to get back and forth to work. Wish I could have stayed. Everyone at the Party City that I worked at was great. We all got along great.
good,"fun and energetic coworkers "
good,"Great Job , Amazing job environment , all team members are eligible for discounts , good hours , but no job Benifits for team members nor paid time off/sick days."
good,"This job included a lot of customer interaction. Some responsibilities included blowing up balloons, ringing up customers, recommending different products to customers based on the occasion they are celebrating, and assisting with costume choices."
good,Communication skills are vital at PartyCity due to the importance of the job and the necessity of the customers. Workplace was usually clean and welcoming with friendly workers.
good,"Good job to get entry level experience in the e-commerce field. The downside is Party City is slow to promote hard working individuals even when there are positions available, this also counts for the high turn over rate."
good,"the only issue with working at party city is having to ask every single customer for their email address . aside from that it's very fun atmosphere so long as you just do your job. you get to spend a good bit of time helping customers plan parties and costumes. events. how can you not have fun when you're making a gender reveal box for some new mom and dad to be. it's great. it also has all the things retail comes in the dark side of retail that is. "
good,"Typical work days consist of lots of customer service, stocking merchandise, and recovering the store. Fast-paced. Strong sense of community between coworkers especially around halloween season. Hard to get hours during off-season. The pay is not great, it's not very difficult to advance positions, but they don't pay well all-around, even for managers. The management is not very well coordinated but it's easy to get days off. Overall, the best part of the job is the people."
good,Good job over all. A lot of moving around. Meet good friends there. I liked when the holidays came around got to see many kids with smelling faces got to help out families with their Halloween costume
good,"for a partime job it was a good experince"
good,"After Halloween they cut your hours, this job is good for college students or extra income. My experience was alright I enjoyed being around the people I work with they are very helpful. Job was easy just exhausting at times. Mistakes are never taken lightly."
good,"During halloween time, the place is a zoo. Nonstop work especially if you close. You cannot leave until the whole store is organized and clean. So even tho you were scheduled to leave at 11pm, you would sometime get out around 1230 am."
good,"Working at party city was a great experience,the management team was so helpful and fun to be around,the employees were very helpful and friendly,the customers were Awesome! the hardest part of the job was blowing up balloons and checking customers out because the lines would get so long"
good,"Working at Party City through the B&G club was good, wish i had more of a chance to work. The program Job Ready gave a certain amount of hours to work while you're in school."
good,Great place to work part time. Helping customers add the finishing touches to their parties and events made the atmosphere fun and easy going. During the busy halloween season there was always something to do and have fun with at the same time.
good,While working at party city on a daily basis I would help the guests on their halloween costumes and help them find whatever they needed for their costume.
good,Most of the team members don't like doing things unless told they would be disciplined. For the most part everyone works together in a respectful manner.
good,working at party city you had to have a lot of energy dealing with the people. you want them to buy more when they come to the cashier ready to go see if you can make them get more. see if you can make they outfit better for them.
good,"Note: I worked at a temporary location that was strictly Halloween City, not Party City. I loved working there, due to my age I was technically not allowed to move up at all, which I did not mind. I loved being on the floor and helping people find costumes and accessories. I felt like such a valued team member that my input was not only heard, but we actually did some of what I suggested. We were also allowed to wear costumes while working so long it was appropriate, who wouldn't want to do that?"
good,A typical day at work consisted of me restocking shelves and trying to find more things to restock.  Sometimes I had the opportunity to complete balloon orders.
good,Everyday was a new fun task. Some days we were able to dress up in different costumes. The computers like to crash on you but I think it was a pretty good experience.
good,"Easy to learn job , coworkers are very nice. management is a little off but other than that it is a very well work place. blowing balloons and helping costumers is a very good way to spend your day at work."
good,"I would recommend for a first-time job, you learn how to engage with customers but also learn how to use a cash register. The people I have dealt with are nice for the most part, just be ready for a rush during Halloween"
good,"My co-workers were usually very fun, and understanding. I developed more patience at this job. Some managers were nicer than others, but overall all very understanding."
good,I always had something to do. I was always working fast and helping customers. Everyone was always smiling and laughing. Everyone was very nice. This job has taught me to be more open and gave me courage to talk to customers and not be nervous.
good,Party city is a big party place everyone is always smiling having fun and making all costumers feel welcomed and making sure they have everything they need.
good,Party City is a cool place to work. You meet all kinds of different people and it has a nice vibe to it. The layout of the store is easily navigable but the layout of the products is absurd. But overall it's a good place to work.
good,The management was good. I learned valuable skills like time management and cashier skills. The people were nice and encouraging.
good,"Working here is fun a lot of the time, working at a party store of course. Only things are there is no room for advancement. So working two jobs with this as one works out great."
good,It was a good way for me to stay busy and make money when I was in high school. Good customer service experience and a god way to learn how to communicate.
good,"A typical day was going to my work station and doing the work there. Stocking, pegging, cashiering, recovery, etc. We would always create and fulfill balloon orders."
good,The typical day at work was always fast paced and fun. We could dress up in different costumes and enthuse customers about our products. End the day with meeting last customers and make sure store is clean. Count the registers and take deposit to bank.
good,"The environment is fun to work in because, well, it's a party store. The coworkers and management have a great impact on how long people work there.  People generally only get promoted when another person leaves and the pay raises are not always fair. Blowing up balloons and setting planograms are some of the best part of the job.  A con is that the hours and pay can be lacking for anybody who is not full time management."
good,i think this was the funniest job i had experienced. the atmosphere was fun but the computer systems are outdated. The holidays were fun because everyone was engaged
good,A typical work day was very productive. I learned how to communicate with customers. My co-workers were very friendly and enjoyable. The hardest part of my job is having to be on my feet all day. The most enjoyable part is the people i work with.
good,"more managers than associates, 12 people total on staff, fun place to work and I enjoy the atmosphere and other associates I work with."
good,Not a bad career choice but not the best. Had a tendency to become bored at work due lack of business during certain seasonal periods such as the spring and summer which led to being sent home early some days.
good,"It was an alright company to work for, even after staying at one position for so long the chance for advancement promises were not present."
good,Company did not have much opportunity for advancement. Managers and assistant managers were typically not professional and created a very tense environment for a company that was supposed to be fun and energetic.
good,Working here was a party! There was just enough work to be done and cleaning up after hours was interesting. The coworkers were great for the most part and the management was positive
good,"First official job while in high-school. Simple tasks such as operating the cash registers as well as in charge of the sales floor. Hired only as a seasonal employee, but was kept beyond that time period as a permanent employee."
good,Working at party city I got to interact with so many of the customers who have children like myself. Being able to help the parents and children find what they needed made my day go by so smooth. Being able to talk to the children about so many party theme characters really kept me smiling through out my work day. Being in such a bright and colorful work place with costumes and other party favors i could try on really helped me connect with my customers as well.
good,It's slow most of the time but when it get busy it really gets busy. Halloween is always really fun. Working at party city isn't hard at all.
good,"The key to working Party City has to be a well rounded team of associates that can be flexible to due multi tasking, a lot of seasonal changes plan o gram maintenance on a daily basis constantlyfilling outs to keep the integrity of the store."
good,"I got a lot of  work  with  the cash register and drive through but it was a bit too much  for  my first job. Plenty of customer  interaction, not a lot to clean up. But orders and dealing with many customers  was a bit much at times really needed more training with  situations."
good,"Creating sales of the product Working closely with the marketing department regarding the creation of interest about the product."
good,"A typical day at work consists of down stocking my zone, making missing labels, while merchandising the product, and making sure the customers are being taking care of. I have learned exceptional merchandising skills from my superiors and truly enjoy working with them. The hardest part of my job is being able to deal will our staff relocating, or receiving new trainees. The part I enjoy the most is being able to work in my zone (my designated area of the store)."
good,Fun place to work and the Management worked well with the staff.
good,It's a fun place to work because of the people. But the company does not have paid sick days. They opportunities to move up are scarce and the scheduling after the season is harsh.
good,Store organization was confusing to the customers as well as the employees. Security cameras were not working.
good,I really enjoyed working for a company that great. Cool people to work with definitely a good work environment
good,"Good customer service and retail experience."
good,"2 Positions within Company - Market Manager and Site Manager"
good,"The most enjoyable part at my job is working with the kids, blowing people balloons up, and enjoying dressing up for halloween season."
good,The staff is easy going but the upper management is somewhat difficult to please on a day to day basis.
good,"each day started out somewhat slow, but would pick up around the afternoon. most of the employees were friendly, and had a good attitude towards customers and other workers. dealing with customers sometimes got a little hectic, but was not so bad."
good,"the workers were fun, but there was a lot to do, if you can't handle being busy all day, than it's not the job for you !"
good,I would say party manager didn't do there job like the we're suppose to. so of the worker's we're cool to get along with some of them came in late. which made us stay longer to work but i know i'm a hard worker so it wasn't a problem in the most case. though i was seasonal at that time but the manager troy didn't like i really had no clue i was never late always on time. never had any write up i just don't have no clue but i am a great and hard worker.
good,"We sold seasonal items through out the year.  Through Halloween, the busiest time of the year, we get packed all day with hundreds of costumes and needy customers.  "
good,"A typical day at work at Party City would be working the cash register, balloon counter, helping customers find items, and organizing the store. What I've learned by working here are the skills to work retail, to work well with others, time management, ect."
good,"I have been working for the company for several years and it is a fun place to work. I get along with my co-workers and bosses. However, the company has terrible pay and you are expected to go above and beyond what you are required to do with the little pay they throw you."
good,"Extremely top-down management style of this company makes it really hard to be invested. That said, hey, working in a party store isn't terrible. The people (staff and customers) were generally pretty cool, and it can be fun helping put together the celebrations and events that punctuate their lives."
good,"great place to work ,good ensitives nevr a dull moment great customer service experiance u can gain good people to work with"
good,"So while working for this company it was okay, why? well, they make you feel like if you know everything and they expect you to know what they mean by saying go read me this and your like what? and that's when you start feeling stupid. so I end up just leaving."
good,I enjoyed helping kids pick out costumes with their families during the halloween season. Management was respectful for the most part. Customers didn't often give employees a hard time.
good,The job it self isn‚Äôt bad it‚Äôs a good working maintaining environment. It doesn‚Äôt really get busy but during the holidays it‚Äôs based with more work than other times.
good,Helped customer find costumes for Halloween and provided good customer service by helping find the items that were asked for or wanted by the customer. Helped manager and co workers clean the store and close.
good,They knew how to run a store properly but the managers they hired did nothing but talk and text on their phones. They didn't help with the store product and cleaning. All they did was do returns and anything that needed a manager for the cashier. They loved playing favorites and putting who they thought deserved it on cash register.
good,"Fun place to work,get to dress up everyday in a different  costume and help customers find the perfect costume for them.Show the kids what each costume did"
good,Fun to work at party city specially on Halloween. favorite part was we dress up of what we want to be. Great people and helping customers makes me happy when they are satisfied.
good,While working there for seasonal it was a bit disorganized and a lot of rushing around especially since it was around a holiday. The pay wasn‚Äôt too bad.
good,"When I was there the regional manager was negative and non supportive. The store manager came in during Halloween to a store that was not run correctly, he spent hours and hours cleaning it up and organizing with a regional coming in and blowing him to pieces."
good,Clocking in and seeing a small tight knit crew get along and work together as a team was enjoyable. I learned how to properly manage difficult customers and some employees.
good,"The only problem i had with the job were my coworkers and there drama and it was really boring, only fun during halloween. I would work there again if i really needed a job."
good,I didn't really like it much cause they lay was wack and I was getting no whereand the hours were dying down so they didn't really need me as much like I only had  2-3 days of work and I never got the hours or salary that I needed to progress in life
good,"During high school, i was able to gain credits and payment through a temporary job at Party City. My high school counselor set this opportunity up for me, and it was a fun place to work in during October."
good,I truly enjoyed working and helping my customers plan for there events. I didn‚Äôt work many hours but enjoyed the time I did work. It was a pleasure to work with and around good people who appreciated me and my hard work. Thanks
good,"Overall I‚Äôd say its a good starting job, you learn the fundamentals of being a retail associate, learn how to work independently and as a team, and generate good work experience for future roles."
good,"I enjoyed working there, I had many good times but as well as bad times. The manager there did nothing but sit down and complain about problems but wouldnt do anything about it. He also used peoples mental health problems and would brodcast about it. I would recommend working here if the manager that was there isnt there anymore."
good,"Existe la deserci√≥n de personal,por consecuencia aumenta el cargo de trabajo para el resto de los colaboradores,no se pagan horas extras ni se recuperan."
good,Sales associate are responsible for a lot of task for little pay. Good first job. If you love talking to customers and giving suggestions this is the place to be.
good,"Loved the environment and my fellow co-workers for everyday there was something new I could learn from my happy, positive, cheerful manager. If it had paid a little bit more, I would have stayed and made a career out of it. Helping people to throw party's, laugh, learn, and create life long friendships, and getting paid for it. There was nothing better."
good,"Overall the job is not bad. However, due to the small teams sizes, you are considerably overworked. Breaks are short and the pay does not reasonably match the position or workload."
good,It was a fun job and awesome place to work for. Some days were slow others were busy. Not many employees working there so really short staff at times.
good,I had enjoyed my time at Party City managment was great and the other  employees  Were pleasang to work with. The job was really lax the only time it gets rwally busy is halloween.
good,I worked ther for a couple months for seasonal and the main manager was always angry and always rude and disrespectful.Many people didn't enjoy talking or being around her and she was always negative.
good,"I mean, for a seasonal job its one thing, because its frequently busy and you'll get a good amount of hours in depending on which station you're located at."
good,Overall a decent first job opportunity. You learn alot there but not worth all if the dedication and hard work. Definelty can not turn it into a career.
good,Party City Management was awesome. Iliked the way they interviewed me. It was fun but at the same time it was also professional . I would reccommend working there.
good,"Party City wasn't too terrible."
good,"enjoyed the staff and working wiith customers to help them plan their events,could definitely get a better pay for the duties and responsibilities.need asset protection to cut down on the theft internal and external"
good,I worked here just for a seasonal position. It was during Halloween time. It was really fun. The staff were really good to work with. It was a good job.
good,"I have worked at party city going on 12 years now, I  have been there though all the changes, the up and the down. I at one point in my career truly did enjoy my job and the environment. I feel right now party city is expecting to much of us management and not providing us with the tools necessary to get the job done."
good,"Decent place to work, can get busy around Halloween season, but normally not too bad.  Around Halloween there are normally more employees hired to deal with the increase in customers and at times that can create more confusion because there are so many people, but still not a bad place to work and gain experience."
good,"Party City has many fun aspects. The products carried are fun, colorful, and they encourage high energy and engaging the customer with seasonal fun wearables. The actual work is not extremely manual, there is some lifting involved with freight and resets, but mostly just a lot of walking and climbing ladders. If you work here be aware you will not be able to get time off from September through most of November. Halloween is their blackout period. (As in my father was in a coma and I was working. I worked a half day when we unplugged his life support and he passed because it was on October 31st).  The benefits are really good. They offer vacation, sick pay, holidays, 401k matching, health with HSA option and HSA contributions, dental, life insurance, disability, aflack, vision, and more for full time employees. The pay is not good. Get a great starting salary because you will not get more than a 3% increase anually without being promoted. The work load is too high. You are not given enough time to complete the required tasks and give adequate customer service. This makes the job very stressful when it would be otherwise and ideal retail experience. You will be required to work weekends and close a minimum of once a week possibly more."
good,A typical at Party City was taking balloons orders and restocking also checking people out. My fingers would hurt from tying up ribbons to the balloons. i would get headaches from going up and down ladders all day from restocking or looking for costumes.
good,My first job so it was a little hectic for me most of the managers were fun to work for as they made work a relaxing place while others were very up tight and made it a drag to come to work that day.
good,"working during Halloween at party city was chaos but it was also fun for me seeing the kids excited to dress and find their perfect costume, Even tho e always stayed 2-3 hours after we closed."
good,Fast paced job!!!! Only around for three months....must like a challenge to  make it!!!!!!  But you will meet some awesome people and work with some awesome people and that's what makes it a good job!!!!
good,"The best thing about a job should always be the environment you work in. Having a good team that support you is one important aspect of retail work. Working at Party City, you'll learn things about party planning you never knew you needed to know, and learn how to inflate and tie latex balloons faster than the speed of light (no exaggeration there). Managers typically want the best for their employees, and try their best to make everyone feel comfortable learning the way things are done."
good,"The difficulty of a day's work at Party City varies with the time of year. Expect to work long hours in a cramped, fast-paced environment, and deal with many rude/irate customers during the Halloween season."
good,"I was really excited to start working at Halloween City, but that quickly changed overtime. The store was not even open before I decided to quit. The amount of work me and my co-workers were required to do everyday did not match the salary we were receiving. You could tell the management was hectic because there were so many problems with the design plans for each section in the store almost every day."
good,Party city is a fun place to work. Lots of work to be done and time goes by fast when working at party city. Learning about products was fun for me and it can be for anyone that wants to work for party city .
good,"At the several Party City stores I have worked at I have always gotten along well with my coworkers and a fun work environment and friendly relationships are easy to cultivate, even among different ranks and positions. The work load can vary by day or by season (busy seasons are graduation and Halloween, slower seasons are winter and spring). Sometimes the work load can become overbearing trying to complete tasks but also maintain sales focus. Corporate has very high standards that they expect the stores to maintain but do not always provide the necessary resources to do so, such as payroll hours or sending materials needed to complete a task on time. Overall not a bad place to work but it can be difficult to strike a balance between managing corporate expectations and sales floor reality."
good,"* organize isles"
good,"When I started out as a temporary employee, there was plenty of opportunity to grow in management.  Once I got promoted, the idea of ""do more with less"" was promoted.  Staffing is a huge issue until the Halloween season and lastly pay raises and promoting would take a while."
good,"Party City was a good place environment as long as I was work with good employees and Management."
good,"Party city is great place to work at, well for me it depends on when I work. if its in the morning it's great cause it doesn't get busy till 11:00 so we do have some time to ourselves. then when it get's busy, you will not have time to rest. after the time goes by its back to it being quiet and you have to do the returns, which are putting things back where they came from. and that's it for the morning shift. if you work the night shift, then all you do are returns and you also have to do isles, which are fixing the isles you are assigned to. that's it for the night shift."
good,Party City was a blast to work at. Except when Halloween is over and they fire a ton of staff. Other than that it's a fast paced but also easy going environment. It allows for people to work as a team and get stuff done.
good,"Very Seasonal Store Constant Changes with the right team this would be a great job but with out communication everything will fall apart, Very fun workplace"
good,"management was very rude and not very flexible. they usually only had one cashier working at a time(besides on weekends), and expected cashier to stock and top stock merchandise in between customers which made work overwhelming."
good,Party City was a fun High school job that i had during the summer. The coworkers were all so friendly and the environment was always amusing. I learned a lot about different types of toys and costumes.
good,The work staff we nice people that like to communicate with each other. The work environment seemed to be in disarray most of the time. Which could be due to the items on the shelf being oddly arranged or misplaced by costumers. The building needed regular maintenance on its A/C units which slowed work during the summer since the store was not well ventilated. The other issue was the  management (which has changed after I left) since they allowed many employees to be either slow or messy with their work.
good,My manager was able to work with other employers to get things to work and do as told from his manager. I have his contact as someone to say good things about how good of a worker i am when placed at another job.
good,"Overall, the job is easy and can be fun. Company has bad priorities and is just another corporation. The pay is okay unless you are upper management. General managers are compensated well."
good,Big company with many positions for seasonal such as Halloween and the positions keep you busy for the whole day which makes for a quick day but overall there are seldom permanent positions.
good,"Worked for the halloween season, got good hours and a great learning experience, I would recommend to any one looking for a good temporary position in s"
good,"The work is tedious and not very rewarding, however, the people are the reason you stay there. Most everybody is kind and friendly. The work is not particularly strenuous, but around the holiday season, you can find yourself going 1000 miles per hour doing multiple tasks at once. The best part of the job are the coworker parties and events, they are very fun and generally a good time."
good,awesome bubbly staff. It is a very fun place to work during the halloween season. The managers are very nice and driven and work oriented. The salary was also very good.
good,"Always an upbeat atmosphere when you walked into my party city's location, we kept it clean and safe for our customers. Even at times during hectic holidays we managed to make everyone happy before leaving our store."
good,"Very fun and busy. co workers were very fun, most of the seasonal workers. The store manager and assistant store manager was very awesome."
good,"It was a fun job with a lot of co workers, managers weren't the best they were intimidating and if u asked a question it felt like unwas bothering them. Work was not hard but it was hard to stay busy"
good,co-workers and managers are friendly and nice and have high patience. Customers are pretty rude around the area but working there was fun. Long hours to stand but it's like any other job out there for retail
good,"A typical day at work is a mixture between face-paced, steady and slow. I learn something new every shift and experience as much as I can. I find it easy to manage this job because of the limited amount of hours I am offered weekly and the convenient location of Party City, Belleville. My co-workers are the nicest and most warm and welcoming people I have come across. The hardest part of this job, in my opinion, is the lack of hours I'm given to work. The most enjoyable part of this job, in my opinion, is getting to converse with customers when I am serving them from the other side of the counter as a cashier. Having that opportunity to assist others and give them a smile to leave the store with."
good,"The day would be great but when it came to  closing, everyone was playing even the managers. I enjoy the communication between co worker and employees but there is a certain level"
good,"it was really fun, learned how to correctly blow up a balloon and tie it in a quick manor.My cowokers were really nice and helped me whenever I needed help. The management was really good."
good,There was not much to this job. It was a simple job in a reasonable work environment. There was high turn over. It was a monotonous workplace.
good,"I liked it for the most part.I was there for exactly the time i was suppose to be there, never really had to work overtime, the workers are very independent."
good,"My only concern is you do so much and get paid very little. Managers have attitudes, so much work and not enough pay. Employees are rude"
good,"Very stressful, quickly provide to customers, attend high number of customers in timely manner."
good,Really enjoyed working there. The people were great and it was a fun environment to work in. I did mostly stocking and moved old store to new store.
good,This was a great experience for my first job. I loved my management and my staff. It was a great environment to work in although my personal franchise owners I did not like.
good,"Party City is a great summer job or job while you're in high school. However, the management where I worked was poor and did not work well with my cheerleading schedule. I loved the job, the customers are usually a lot of fun and the store is high energy."
good,"Party City is a great place to work if you're only looking to make a about 200 bucks every two weeks. This job is basically like any other retail job. You get 30 minutes for lunch after working more than 6 hours in a day. I would recommend this job as a first job to build experience, but try not to start when it's very close to Halloween because you will be overwhelmed. Halloween time is the only time you will be getting lots of hours and good pay."
good,You spend a long time on your feet but everyone is very laid back. Sometimes you get managers that have no idea what they are doing but for the most part they are very helpful and keep the craziness of the store to a minimal.
good,"A typical day at work was working with customers and providing the best information. I learned how to make balloon bouquets,and work with a different company. Management was not run very well. The manger should have been fired for improper work ethic. My co-workers were a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of the job was graduation time because there would be over 200 balloon bouquets to make in one day. The most enjoyable was being able to be creative and help people plan amazing parties for their occasion."
good,"customer service was big deal which was a good principle to have in the store"
good,"At work , everyday was a fast paced working day. As soon as you walked it was right to work. It was a fun environment that was also easy going once you got to know the store. The hardest part of my job would be when it was night out and there was less customers there , this was hard because it got very quiet and i like being around customers. The most enjoyable was everyday when i started job because everyday there were new learning and knowledgeable experiences."
good,A typical day at work can consists of enjoyable customer service for nice costumes for children and adults. I have learned how to work even more effectively and faster under pressure. Management isn't so okay being that some employees had to take action without supervision or command. The hardest task of the job was delivering different costumes for customers and kids all ages with fast pace. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with different adults & kids with different personalities.
good,"A typical day would consist of following a work list or consulting upper management of our tasks for the day. If it's morning shift, most likely, it would be inflating balloons for orders made ahead of time as well as handling walk-in orders. After that is complete, we would push out stock on the shelves (or place them in storage above their shelves if there is extra), prepare aisles for seasonal and holiday merchandise, and tidying up the store by taking misplaced products throughout the aisles, organize them, and placing them back on their designated spot. The most difficult part of the job would be replacing whole aisles with the seasonal and holiday merchandise. It requires several people, placing decorations throughout the aisles, many walls to cover, as well as boxing all the previous merchandise to another location. However, with our professional employees, the work goes by quickly and we finish ahead of time. The most enjoyable part of the job would be organizing all the misplaced products back to where they belong. There is a satisfaction that comes from keeping a store organized."
good,"A typical day of work for seasonal employees ( Halloween to be exact) consists of :helping customers select merchandise, keep the store in a neat an orderly by putting merchandise back in its assigned section and clearing aisles of clutter, making sure displays are in order, answering phone calls, putting items on hold for customers, assisting customers in the fitting room, checking to see if an item is in stock for customers,operating the cash register and finalizing sales, assist in taking balloon orders."
good,"Party City is a fun environment to work in. Typical days include either running the register, keeping the front clean, putting out freight, or cleaning up around the store. The management team is nice and willing to work with employees. My co workers are one of the main reasons why I really enjoy the job, everyone works together to insure that things get done."
good,"Work all day "
good,I liked working there but i think the manager could done a better job at working the schedule
good,Management has very cool and intelligent people who are very dedicated to making sure you learn a lot.
good,"A typical day at work is coming in 5-10 minutes before we open, work 9-4pm. Either I'm the cashier or I'm out doing customer service while doing freight. I have learned more about costumer service after about a year of working there. The company is really big on customers service, which we are really evaluated twice a month because of it. We call this secret shop, meaning that a customer comes in the store and tells how the the customer service was and how the store appeared. We are graded by the appearance of the store, did we approach the customer timely, did the cashier ring them out fast and correctly. It's really hard for this company to get really good employees since most of the time we get high school students and first time workers. I think this is a really good first time job, but it is a lot of work when you don't understand the importance of customer service and how to properly talk to customers. I really like my managers and co-workers, which will help me through a bad day at work or a difficult customer. "
good,I enjoyed being around all the employees and customers. The co-workers were fun and outgoing. The hardest part of the job was having a long line while only one cashier was working.
good,"A typical work day depended on what season it was. Off season would include setting plan-o-grams, stocking shelves, recovering merchandise, and ringing out transactions. During season (Halloween) daily task would include specific zones that would switch daily, depending on need of store. Upper management was always there when needed. They trusted you to complete certain task at your own pace by a deadline. Lower management was a little difficult seeing as the median age was 19. It was more about the outside then the workplace. Co-workers were fine for the most part. Of course there were problems as there are with every job. Hardest and most enjoyable part of Party City was Halloween. It was extremely busy and chaotic at times. It taught me to kill people with kindness and keep my cool. It was also the most enjoyable due to the increased hours and the fun that came with the season."
good,Can get busy throughout the day. Helpful managers. Responsible honest co workers.
good,I stocked at party city. I like working there but spme time employee make feel not welcome and some of them are not a good mood. The hard jobs is to return the item back on shelves. I may sure the customers are happy and find something they looking for.
good,Pretty much what you would expect from a minimum wage customer service job. Really enjoyed my coworkers and there was a lot of opportunity for fun. Overall a good job.
good,"I only worked for Party City for two months and during that time I learned how important representation matters, when everything is stocked perfectly and neat it sells more. Halloween season was really stressful because it was a small space and many customers at a time, one learns a lot of patience there."
good,"The old coworkers were fine, we all did our job. It would've been better if the manager wasn't putting her issues on us and if she actually knew what was going on, instead of just being snobby and getting mad for little to no reason. She left my experience bitter. Everyone was on egg shells so they won't have to deal with her. Customers would complain that she wasn't friendly. As much as we tried giving customers a great experience, she'd find a way to reverse it. I learned that even if I did my job correctly, I'd still get scolded for it. The most difficult part of the job was dodging the manager. Everyone has their own battles. doesn't give her the right to just make things worse."
good,"It was a fun company to work for and the customers were great. You were helping plan parties and such so they were generally happy. The company reset 30% of the store and this was  an ongoing process. Everyday plan-o-grams and season were worked on all the time, but because of hour given to the store we usally had to cover for the merchandizers on our own time."
good,"It was not bad, the managers were nice and funny, my co-workers were friendly and were a pleasure to work with, it was a bummer when I left when I no longer needed."
good,"Es un giro que te exige facilidad para resolver dudas de fiestas, iniciativa para incrementar ventas cruzadas."
good,You never know what your day is going to be like here. Overall things are laid back and the management does a good job making sure that everyone is up to par.
good,"I enjoy working here most of the time. Recently management has not been as functional as desired and hour cuts have resulted in a large amount of strife between all levels in our location. "
good,"I worked during the October Seasonal Position while actively looking for other jobs. It was acceptable as a temporary job. The staff was respectable, the position only asked me to assist customers quickly (whether as a cashier or during restocking), and the only complaint is that when you explain to a customer that there is a no refund policy they may become aggressive at which point the management has to take over. As this is a temporary position there is not room for pay raises or career advancements."
good,"Most days were slow paced except for Saturdays which were big balloon days but it would die out by afternoon. Halloween is hectic also, especially the week leading up to it when the store is open until 12 am but its not unbearable. Management was great and always looked to help the employees when possible."
good,i was a seasonal sales associate and i was there for about two weeks. the staff wasn't that bad but some of the original staff were a bit distant. i worked during halloween which was very busy but i didn't mind.
good,"A typical day of work is very dependent on the day you go in. Weekdays are usually slow, with moments throughout the day that you are severely understaffed.Weekends are always busy, with the busiest on Saturdays(but very well staffed)."
good,"My short time at Party City was great! It was my first job. I was able to quickly learn the register and what I enjoyed the most was the costumes. Around Halloween it got busy, but thats a good thing. I enjoy busy. A few things I did not enjoy was the tiny area where we could eat, It was very crammed. Some days it got stressful especially when told to do multiple things. Other than that I love working there"
good,"The Party City I worked at had bad management. However I actually loved working for the company, It was a good place but it wasn't a place for me. But i recommend anyone who likes to put parties together, to work there its actually pretty cool"
good,If you love Halloween then this is a perfect part time seasonal job for you. It's tons of fun. It gets super stressful though closer to Halloween when everyone does their last minute shopping and the stores are packed.
good,"A typical day at work is i come in say hi to the passing co-workers while going to clock in. Then i will check all messages, voice mails, and emails that need to be attended to. as continue my day as my schedule is produced."
good,Morning shift: A typical day would be checking daily tasks of making sure reports to the front end is complete before the end of the shift. The workplace is diverse that the anybody working there feels safe and can enjoy each other company.
good,"The working environment was great, all managers and co-workers gave positive attitudes, and the pay was good. Gave me the chance to see what it was like to be a sales associate. I learned the cashier, i stocked costumes in the back, i cleaned, and i memorized where all products were located in the store."
good,"A typical day would be get to the store early before the doors open, unload the truck and sort the boxes into the correct aisle and then start to stock the shelves, as a cashier, then you would count the drawer then help out with the balloon counter."
good,"I enjoyed this environment very much. For an entry level temp job at Halloween, the opportunity for an actual job afterward really feels like a reward for hard work."
good,Face pace working environment. Store is constantly changing because of the different seasons of the year. Always changing polices. Always a test to review or take on the Party Apps site to help keep employees informed of new polices.
good,"I was fortunate to work for some wonderful managers.  The company as a whole is very disconnected.  Directions are send down before their ready, fixtures arrive 2 months early or 2 months late, promotions are created without product to support, etc.  The benefits package is unbeatable and it's fun helping people plan holidays and special events."
good,"If you are looking for a first time job, I highly recommend party city. It's a fun atmosphere where I have made some of the closest friends and met the best people."
good,"The work week has gotten hard with recent reductions in payroll. The tasks have not disappeared, but the help has.  I still like working there, everyday is a party. Love the customers."
good,"Barely any hours outside of Halloween time."
good,"The manager is a super nice woman, she would always accommodate our schedules and give us more hours if we were willing to work them in the Halloween season."
good,Fun at first be a lot of drama but anyways it wasn't that bad it like the manager are cool and you learn to blow up balloons fast lol that one big perk right ?
good,Management was alright but coworkers and environment was enjoyable. It was a very much great experience and it was a lot fun. Especially working closing shifts.
good,"The typical day at this Party City during the Halloween season was always great. The management was kind and let you know exactly what they needed from you. My coworkers were the best partners. By the end, we were all friends. This was my first experience with retail. I learned more about on floor organization and how to keep busy during the slow periods. The hardest part about this job would have to be the clean up after the big costume rushes. There were usually three to four of us to close up, but we all rushed to make sure the store was in the best condition for the morning shift. I enjoyed my short time at Party City."
good,"my typical day at work would started after I left school. I would go into work and change into my work clothes and get my eye piece. I would go down the rolls to find a piece of a costume to wear while I checked out people at the front. After two hours of checking out people and helping cleans rows I would go on break with some coworkers. we had 30 minutes for lunch. After that I would go back to the register and start back up. I would always get those cute babies getting costumes for Halloween. Two hours went by and it was time to start cleaning up and that's when the hard work really started. Children run though party city and found everything they wanted, and when it's time to go they put it back anyway. So it was our job to find everything they throw back and put it back in place. Putting stuff back could take up to 2 or 3 hours or shorter if we won't playing around with the managers, but that was the fun put of our jog. Around 1 in the morning everything would be done and it was time to go."
good,All my bosses were good people and I enjoyed those I worked alongside. However I was rarely told I could take breaks and would often times not receive one even after working long shifts.
good,"This company is your typical retail party store. there are lots of opening positions around holidays. the pay is never good when it involves retail, unless you are a manager or corporate. Very fun place to work and there is room for advances but n benefits. This is a job for mainly teenagers unless your looking to come in as a manager."
good,Party city is great place to start if you are looking for your first job or a part time lob n the side. I was lucky enough to get a promotion to receiving manger but not much after that. Growth within this company is scarce as there really isn't a lot of availabilities open. My co-workers are great but there are times when you get some bad ones. A lot of the employees are young still in high school or fresh out of high school with also a few older workers.
good,"Start of the day usually begins with me coming in and greet other employees then heading to a register to clock in. One of my managers will tell me if I am needed at register, the back room, or the sales floor. I learned a lot about the register and how to approach customers who are looking for a certain item. I had three managers who were all pretty laid back but when it came time to work we all knew what had to be done. My co workers and I had a great relationship at work and even after work. The hardest part of my job was getting there because i didn't have the most reliable vehicle at that particular time. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people with their Halloween costumes. I always had fun talking and helping everyone."
good,Being professional under all circumstances is a must. Approaching each customer individually making sure they are fully satisfied with what we offer. Being friendly and polite to everyone is the way to having a positive environment at all times.
good,"too much emphasis is put on the wrong things. advancement opportuinity is nice, less than 6 months there and hard work got me 2 promotions. The hardest part of the job is the store reset after halloween. The most enjoyable are the customers. most stores in our district are understaffed and employees are lazy teenagers with no drive or determination."
good,The most enjoyable part of the day was helping people purchase accessories for the kids birthday parties. Its a fun place to work at if you like helping people plan for upcoming events or parties.
good,I enjoy most of the people I work with. I really enjoy dealing with the public and assisting customers in their needs.
good,"A typical day at work is never the same. Helping customers plan and decorate for events/occasions is an awesome feeling!! From helping the customer find what they need or want, inflating balloons for the event, to checking them out at the registers, is a very satisfying thing!! Stocking and conditioning merchandise was a daily routine."
good,It was fun meeting new faces and everybody got along so wonderful
good,This is a good company to work at for mainly teenagers. I did learn how to socialize better with the customers and get them what they need. The hardest part of the job was trying to settle down an angry customer and the most enjoyable part of the job was having a customer leave satisfied.
good,It gets really busy surprisingly. You my not think so but it does. You better be able to multi task well cause 9/10 your gonna be under staffed and gonna have to deal with customers at the register and helping people on the floor at the same time
good,"I enjoy working with the great team but depending on the location, the hours aren‚Äôt satisfactory.This would be a great 2nd job. The hours are also flexible with other jobs and school. The dress code is comfortable. The products sold by the company are cheaply made and customers complain about them daily, but we try our best to fulfill the needs of the customers."
good,"I really loved my job, it felt like a little family. I liked filling up the balloons and cashing out the customers. I loved my managers but then we got new ones and they were a lot less easy going. Customers would always leave good reviews abut my service and when I got a new job I was immediately seen with more potential so I had to leave and move on."
good,"It was a very fast paced environment. I was not given a lot of days to work. Managers were a bit rude. My co workers were very nice, welcoming and understanding."
good,"First year there wasn't too bad but it honestly depends on which party city your at. Other than the usual personal complaints, the pay and the experience working here for the first year was pretty good. That was until our party city joined the many other ones in being purchased by AAH Holdings(Head Corporation). I felt the real impact of this acquisition during my second year at party city. This was mainly due to the large cut in hours given to our Party City. Which went from the usual 300+ hours to barely reaching 210. Which caused many employees to end up working once a week rather than at least three times. As well as a few hogging all the hours because either they were managers or because the same managers preferred them. This led to many days having only one single employee working the floor leading to many tasks to be left undone or just that one person being overwhelmed by everything. Which lead many to eventually quit."
good,It was a fun place to work for but not enough hours in the day to get the job done safely and done correctly. Halloween was the best but could be stressful at times.
good,Working at party city provided me the start of retail/customer service. Maintaining the store clean and assuring that products are on store shelves. It is a good place to start for someone young.
good,"The employee's got along well and helped each other out when the help was needed."
good,party city is a great first part time job because it not that stressful or too difficult. it worth while because you have to actually work and not just stand still and do nothing.
good,"If you're a teen looking for a job as an associate for minimum wage, this job is for you. It's fairly easy, flexible, and worth working for. However, the older you get and the higher you climb the more you realize how awful this company is with not only the pricing of their product/services but also with the salary of their employees. If you are a GM/store owner then it's decent but as a manager it isn't worth it. I've been with the company for 6 years now and have gotten slapped in the face with the kinda of pay they give me for the amount of BS I deal with. (let's just say I can go get a receptionist job somewhere for more money an hour than I do here). But hey, everyone has their opinions/experiences. Who your general manager and who your district manager is, is also a big factor in your experience here. If they are on your side and have the balls to fight for what you deserve, then you'll be fine. If not, then good luck to ya."
good,Started as a temp work and was about to work myself into a full time position for the time it was a good job for me that provided me with good retail skills.
good,"A typical workday can be filled with several balloon orders and interactions with several different customers, answering questions, giving opinions, and so forth. I learned how to better work with a team and learn new skills such as setting planograms. The workplace culture is like a family, you have different people coming together that share something, whether that be their interests, the job, or more. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with semifrequent changes such as tying balloons differently, raised email caption rates, and setting changes in the isles. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet the customers who walk through the doors. There are many interesting, challenging, heartbreaking, and exciting stories that the employee gets to share with the customer as they help put together the customer's party."
good,Employees were fun to work with but the atmosphere is a little depressing. Also they play the same songs on repeat and it can drive someone to the brink of insanity if your not careful.
good,"Fun, holiday temp job! Hours increase as the season progresses. Everybody does everything, for the most part. Knowledge of horror and animated movies is a real plus."
good,"A typical work day at Halloween City would be starting off at the cash register and when business slowed down we would put our stock on the shelves. The hardest part about this job was self pricing the individual costumes.The most enjoyable part about this job is seeing the job on kids' faces when they picked out the costume they liked most. Management wasn't as great as I hoped, the employees did more work and harder work then the managers did."
good,"You need to have a open availability "
good,"I learned to handle money and work cashier at this job. Also I learned how to appropriately  assist costumers, and how to maintain professional relationships with co-workers."
good,"Halloween city was a good experience. I learned A lot about retail and how to handle customers. typical day was to keep the isles cleaned up and have everything hung up, then before closing the store up sweeping the floors."
good,"Party City, was a great first employment experience, loved the people and the the upbeat feeling. There was very few dull moments and the holidays are always busy. I enjoyed this learning experience and look further to using the experience forever."
good,I would have to come to work on time and get right to work and i would one specific job to do for the whole time i am there . My manger was very friendly and did not seem like a bad person . My coworkers were very nice to me . The hardest part of the job was figurin out where things go . The most enjoyable part was just being able to Work .
good,"Generally a steady flow of customers, on feet/walking constantly, speaking to/aiding customers, etc. Generic CSR position. Can be stimulating depending on customer needs."
good,"The company cared about the store as one should, but probably could have done a little better. Although, it is/was only a temporary store, so I completely understand."
good,"It was a good job environment, although in the slow season there are many laid off. In contrast to the busy season(Halloween)."
good,"It was a lot to get done. Being an assistant manager, you were responsible for everything. That was fine. But not so much when not everything got done. Here only managers could preform certain tasks. So that took away from a lot that we could be getting accomplished. Had great co-workers. But some managers weren't there for the right reasons, made it harder for other's in management."
good,"Quickly move up Flexible scheduling meet new people always something going on different holidays fun environment"
good,"Party city was a fun and safe place to work at, fun days, busy days. Meeting new people everyday made the job more interesting. My co-workers where all nice and supporting. The hardest part of the job was closing time."
good,The tasks given are not tedious and are very easy to do. The hours are very flexible and the corporation is very understandable when it comes to school and family life. Management could be slightly better. It all depends on what managers are working. I get along with my co-workers well. I am happy that I got to learn how to work register and to learn how to do tasks faster.
good,"The job itself was a little daunting with no professional training but I did figure it out pretty much myself. I'm very hands on and they didn't offer training till the season was almost over. So i never knew if I was doing a correct job or not. I learned that management is not an easy job and takes work to get it right, takes patience and a lot of energy. The hardest part of the job was being on call all the time. No breaks or days off really."
good,Great place to begin my work experience with great coworkers who were always outgoing and positive made it an exciting work environment.
good,A great place to work dealing with all occasions throughout the year. Helping and meeting people of all walks of life that is in the store shopping for a wide variety of special occasions. You can have fun demoing products in the store to help satisfy customer needs.
good,been able to dress up in different outfits and been a different person to act out.
good,"Party City is a definitely an easy job to work if you are a high school student. Starting college the hours can definitely be tedious if you don't like early mornings or working late shifts (especially if you have an early class next morning) Overall, Party City is a good place to start!"
good,I started working there and went right into it. I went straight to work with no training. I had to pick up on new thing any self and taught my self almost everything.
good,"my work days working with this company would be like 5pm to 1am sometimes even 3am. The great thing that i have learned from being with this company is how to provide excellent customer service while Restocking and add on's. The management in this company was actually very well, they know how to train there employee's, also very understanding in  many situations. Party City is a very cultural workplace that allows you to express yourself freely while doing your job and enjoy it. To be honest the hardest thing i had to do for this company would only be looking for specific items in the store and carrying the stocks of items from the warehouse up and down 35 flights of stairs."
good,The place was overall okay to work at but it got busy during Halloween season and seemed stressful at times. The people I worked with were really friendly and I enjoyed being there.
good,Halloween was one of the most stressful times working there. Never in my life did I ever imagine it was going to be that crazy. But it was fun we were able to dress up and show off some of the costumes we were selling.
good,Working for this company is pretty fun and easy! I had a great manager and coworkers that helped me learn about the job. I normally did cash register and blew up balloons. I never really had an issue with customers unless they accidentally bought a broken item or found out they bought a costume they couldn't return becuase of store policies. Working during the holiday was a lot of fun and setting up the store.
good,"They Have horrible management and what a person  goes through over there they don't pay you enough for it. its a huge hassle but if your fresh out of high school or in high school and want to make a little cash its a great place to work, there all young people working there and its just fun and the discount is amazing too but just not the pay."
good,"I just work there during Halloween, I would have liked to continue working there, Had a great time, Really cool people work there and the manager isn't bad either"
good,"Party City is a fun place to work, and a very friendly environment "
good,"Fun environment but the pay isn't so great Halloween is the only time of the year where you would get a lot of hours. I believe in general if your are currently in school party city for you, but if you're paying bills try your luck else where."
good,"A good day is working at the register and in learned to interact with people more and more. Management is good and works with you. co workers are nice, there are usually a lot so you cant really get to know them, the hardest part is when you have to close with a lot to do and the best part is opening."
good,"Employees are responsible for working in all areas of the store.  Since this is a seasonal job (for everyone) most of the management and coworkers have other jobs, so the team tended to be stressed and overworked.  But overall it was a fun job that was completely centered around Halloween"
good,I must admit i liked it better when i was just a regular associate then being in management. There's too much pressure and your always one your toes
good,"-I would stock csotumes in the back."
good,"Great management, sometimes very boring, but had fun while I was employed there"
good,"Its very productive always somethign to do, the jobs keeps you on your toes."
good,"It was pretty cool being a member at partycity met a lot of intelligent people also creative . "
good,"You'll feel at home and you wont ever feel like you're alone, basically another family. The customers aren't so bad but that's because their service is great"
good,Party City is a good place of business but it was only busy and high in business during Halloween after that it died done a lot. The rush is only for the halloween materials they sell.
good,You will never get bored. There are endless ways and opportunities to help people and make a difference. Helping people make the event that they are putting together for those whom they care about be a success is a wonderful motivation to go to work every day.
good,It was a successful combination of extra hands on deck and fast paced sales. i liked selling the costumes for halloween because it is my favorite time of the year.
good,"It was a very easy job. I just wished they had more hours to give, but no one really shops at Party City on a regular basis. I loved my coworkers. I really enjoyed working during Halloween time!"
good,You get breaks for 30min an clock in and out.The staff is curtios but it got very hectic in october. I had to take care of my mother at home and had to quit while my dad works. Now I need a job because my dad isent struggling to keep the bills.
good,A typical day at work involved me taking care of customers and making sure they were always satisfied and left with a smile
good,"A typical day at work for me would be doing plannograms, stocking, unloading freight, helping customers on the floor, ect. The managers are pretty cool. My co-workers are great, however, I love them and they make the job worth it! The hardest part of the job is the off season, I've currently gone 2 months without a single shift with continuous ""I'll see what I can do, we don't really need more people right now"" instead of rotating the schedule so I could have at least ONE of the like, five another co-worker gets (who does the same thing as me)."
good,"always enjoyed running the sales reports and training our employees, the hardest part was having to deal with clown phobia and some of the employees playing around too much with the masks."
good,"My time at party city was a good leaning experience. I say this because the team was great and the management was good too, they just don't pay enough and when the store wasn't at its busiest it was difficult to find work to do. As of me, I need to work from start to finish and that didn't apply at this job."
good,"I've learned so much from, this job in what brings people to shopp for their kids and getting birthdays, to costumes very fun experience for me."
good,the McDonalds I worked at was well managed. All supervisors did there jobs its a relaxed job but you had to know when to be relaxed
good,"Even though it was seasonal best job I've had so far."
good,Working at PartyCity was a very nice experience. I learned alot of customer service skills. At times managers will be very rude and not reliable on your hours. But overall I had great co-workers.
good,Employees always called in so others had to cover there shifts. Our schedule was constantly changing and sometimes (us college students) had to work very late.
good,My experience was okay not so great since management had to much family preferences so it was almost impossible to ever get extra hours since managers family always came first which i thought was very unfair.
good,"Can be a cool fun place to work at depending on the manegers at times which the only thing I didnt llike was that the environment wasnt a place to have grow increase., yet wasnt any real benefits."
good,Hours were good for a seasonal job. Decent management. Fun place to work.
good,"Listen I like my job, but for me personally the pay isn‚Äôt cutting it for my life. It‚Äôs a fun place to work , my coworkers are cool, it a fun place. Mt"
good,"Very Fun work environment. You work with costumes. Your job will include cashiering, customer service, store tear down and/ or set up, dressing room. Working environment is like that of a small group, you'll get close to them. You get the hours you work for. Work well, you get more hrs. Do poorly, you might end up with only 5hrs."
good,a typical day at work was coming in at 6-7am to clean windows sweep front carpets and make sure everything was ready for the customers to come in. i learned how to use the cash register and to fill balloons. the management were fairly good one of my managers yelled at me a lot and another one made fun of me but overall they were ok. my co-workers were amazing they were fun and inviting i really liked them. sometimes doing five things at once was hard and getting in other peoples way. i really liked working in the excitin fun store.
good,"what you do everyday a the front end is fun. thers always something to do and the majority of it is relatively enjoyable. youll run the register, take and fill balloon orders, play a bit with kids get to know your customers, help people plan all types of parties and events, and help people with costumes. most of the time, you wont be expected to do all of these alone because all floor staf are more than willing to come to te front and help you. asking for assistance and helping one another is strongly encouraged."
good,"I kind of wish I didn‚Äôt just work seasonal, I really enjoyed the overall atmosphere and duties here. It was fast paced but the work was simple and fun."
good,I really dont want to write a review but im being forced to over and over and over again and i dont really find that to be a very good way to run a system to be honest
good,"It was my first job working retail, it was pretty unorganized you had to get in where you fit in so i stuck with it and did my best. It was only seasonal so i got what i could get."
good,What I learned from working at party city was how to communicate with customers and help them get what they needed. also learned how to talk to customers correctly.
good,management is ok however overall party city is a fun place to work
good,"Greeted costumers. Counted, set up and broke down tills. Trained other employees on the registers. Did bank deposits. Assisted costumers with finding the best costume and accessories.  "
good,The company is good and clean. It was fun and a lot of moving around. A lot of heavy lifting is involved.
good,Not the great job but better than nothing.Not secur with little low hours after halloween.
good,The job enviornmet was fast paced you always met new people when helping them look for costumes
good,"There was plenty to do and it kept me occupied enough that time flew by. Definitely not a job for someone who's afraid of clowns and balloons, you'll be around them all the time. My only real complaint is that you don't get paid enough for the amount of work you do."
good,"Halloween city in wilkes barre is a great place to work. It's fun and easy work. Associates are nice and both assistant managers were great to work with. The general manager, well she was filled with drama. She constantly talked bad about both her assistant managers making the associates not want to listen to them. She also talked about associates to other associates. She would snap at people for no reason including customers. She spent most of her day sitting in front of the computer and smoking cigarettes. Corporate was called on her but nothing was done and there was no improvement. She showed favoritism to her daughter and husband that both worked there.giving th all the hours and gift cards for employee accomplishments. She also favored another worker who eventually got caught stealing. She doesnt know how to talk to people and definately needs to learn how to be management."
good,"The franchise owner was by far the best person in the store. Anything we did to try and make the store seem more appealing, or fun, he entirely approved of. However, the ""General manager"" undermined him at literally every turn. And the two managers below them never really followed a word of the owner's request. It was honestly like working with teenagers that never grew up."
good,"The job was at ease not to stressful, there was nothing really hard about the job I‚Äôm a fast learner so nothing was too difficult. Management was great."
good,loved the job hated the boss.... wanted you to do your job plus his as well. was never around when u needed him and expected you to know everything all at once
good,The managers and employees were bice & easy to work with. Alothough at times it can get either really stressful around holidays or very slow in the off season. Quite inconsistent
good,Very physical job. Seasonal changes are very important to complete within the store in a timely manner. Qualified talent is hard to find but is very important to create a productive progressing store.
good,I love working at party City Corporation but hours are not enough and pay is not worth the stress of being by yourself and Managers just sit in the back
good,You can start the season setting up the store and taking it down. You can meet a lot of new people due to it being seasonal. However people leave a lot even during the busy part of the season.
good,This was a fun seasonal job that I worked during the Halloween season. The hours were short and I was able to gain some retail experience and customer service.
good,"Working there was fine. Was able to cashier and get decent shifts during the Halloween rush. I was hired on as seasonal and was told i might be kept on after the season ended. Once the season did end they just stopped scheduling me, took me calling the store 4 or more times to get ahold of the manager to find out I didn't work there any more."
good,Halloween City is a seasonal job that is good for just starting off work experience. It gives you the chance to learn customer service and how to work hands on with cash. I enjoyed working there because of the employees and most customers.
good,Working there is a little stressful due to the fact that you have to deal with customers. I have gotten a few clients who are a bit rude but its part of the job.
good,"Poor management. Working in an environment like PartyCity requires each manager to pitch in and pick up and slack but that was not the case at this location. Coworkers made this environment enjoyable because of the teamwork that we created with one another. The job was easy and laid-back overall; however, the management lacked professionalism and concern for their employees."
good,"If you like to have your inner child come out and take over while you're at work, by all means go ahead. Your coworkers will not all that you think they will be, but get ready to blow up balloons everyday."
good,"My job was to sit at the Cashier all day and wait, while I waited I cleaned and blew up balloons, Management wasn't very kind there but I loved my co-workers. I'd say the hardest part of my job there was keeping up with all the Balloon orders. Best part of my job was being social. I learned how to keep things neat and keep my work space clean."
good,"Helping customers plan they're parties was the only exciting thing about this job. I loved making balloon bouquets, and arches. the managers weren't very nice."
good,The environment was laid back and fun.  I worked the cash register and assisted customers in fitting rooms as well as the sales floor.  My co-workers and managers were very friendly.
good,"I recently moved from New York City to Daytona Beach, and am used to commuting long distances from home to work. Upon moving, I have landed a temp job at Party City in the Port Orange Pavilion. The temp job consisted of basically building the store up: shelving and walls to product placement. The managers are very nice, and the co-workers are very helpful and resourceful. The hardest part of the job is the few hours that we receive, starting up. Sometimes I only get 9 hrs a week, and work two days. The other difficult part of this job is commuting. Port Orange is 6+ miles from my home in South Daytona, and public transportation stops running there at 6pm, so working evenings, weekends, and holidays in a store that demands flexibility is almost impossible. What I enjoy about the store is its party atmosphere, the co-workers, and the customers. I tend to just fly when it comes to customer service and register work"
good,"Usual days were running the cash register,  and answering the phone to help answer customers questions or orders. Early mornings before store hours the shelves would be timely stocked with merchandize."
good,Party CIty isn't a complicated work place. Its good for high school students to earn money and gain work experience. It isn't a place for a long term.
good,"great staff"
good,"the job was very fun and most coworkers were a blast to work with. there were some bumps in the road here and there. not good for a career, but decent if youre looking for a temporary job."
good,Fun place to work but it can get very slow. If it's not busy then you get bored really fast. The managers are good but there was an issue with too many people calling in last second.
good,"Overall, I met a lot of different people through this job. It was simple to get things down. However, there are those small ""retail"" things to do that everyone pegs retail jobs as horrible for such. But, its not such a big store and is actually pretty simple. It was a fun and simplistic environment. I would probably go back if I could for the month of October but don't know if I would be able to stand working there for much longer than that."
good,"As a seasonal employee for Halloween City, my time with the company was short. The management was kind and helpful. The best aspects of the job came from fellow seasonal employees and interesting customers looking for costumes."
good,Easy seasonal job. New mangers every year. Managers could be better but overall fun and easy. A lot of people would steal so I had to keep a close eye on anyone that came in.
good,"Weekday are slower than weekend"
good,"To work at a Party City you must be comfortable working under pressure. In a typical weekend day, you will have 30-50 balloon orders that need to be ready at a certain time."
good,"Demonstrated proficiency with cash and credit transactions , Served as interpreter for Spanish speaking clients, restocked inventory through manual counts"
good,Halloween city was a perfect starter job. You can learn the basics of being an employer and it is a fun work place. Seasonal work but its good to get started
good,It was a fun temporary environment as well as it was creative and a great way to express yourself and also help others put together costumes to express themselves as well!
good,"The place was great to work because of the costumers and some exploring but the issue was the pay provided and no benefits.great costumers great investment"
good,"The experience is a typical Retail store for a seasonal employee, only centered around Halloween. The workplace itself has a nice atmosphere, but with a strong undertone of urgency in some way. Decent for a first job or if you really need a job, but not something that can carry for any real length of time."
good,It definitely helps with career advancement and i have fun meeting new and kind people. Sometimes gets boring on slow days. The manager is unfair or stingy with hours. Not enough pay.
good,"Working there was fun almost every day. Every employee had great personality and almost all were committed to their jobs through and through. However at this location one older female manager in particular was constantly a cause of concern and created more problems than helped solve. These include yelling at non-management employees for unethical or undeserved reasons when no other managers are around, leaving the work floor constantly to smoke or catch up on a ball game on a radio, and picking fights with customers regularly. No attempts had been made to correct or remove said manager despite countless complaints to the head manager from customers and employees alike."
good,During my time at Party City I worked the Halloween seasonal position. A typical day included a team meeting before each shift and then going out speaking to customers. The fun came with being able to wear the costumes to advertise and showing people what some of the cool costumes did.
good,I enjoyed working at party-city and my coworkers and I became like a team. However the reason I am leaving is because of my boss. He would always make jokes about the workers and it always bothers me. It wasn't until this Halloween season that I decided to take a stand after noticing that our pay statements were altered after we went over on hours. When i confronted my boss he said the district manager was mad that not everyone takes breaks (which by the way we would if we were allowed to) and so my boss added breaks to our pay statement to take off hours so it seemed like we didn't go over on hours. I have always been a good employee in my opinion I go above and beyond because I like to know that I am doing a good job. regardless of my disagreements with the management I learned a lot of valuable skills as an associate and as a front end supervisor. I also enjoyed being able to help customers bring their ideas to life and seeing the smiles on their faces after helping them. Overall I did have a good experience at party city and I just wish I didn't have to leave.
good,Lots of work added on not apart of job description.  Promised help but always taken when you have them trained. Minimum wage pay. Work you till steessed out and sick. Still will say not doing enough.  Not emoughb people to do work. High turnover of people working there.
good,Love the work I was able to do with the company but due to terrible management I resigned. worked with this company for over three years and was promoted twice within the store but unfortunately with management changes my positions were compromised. Never once was given a raise unless issued by the government. Busy at halloween but was nothing a big seasonal staff couldn't handle.
good,A summer job I had to help pay for college. I learned a lot nd it was a fun experience.  My favorite part was working at balloon counter. The managers were very judgey about me. I didn't feel as if I was part of the team.
good,If you don't want many hours then this is a great place to work. If you are looking for a place for advancement this is not it. On average you MIGHT get 4 - 5 hours a day
good,Working at Party City required being very social with customers and helped me learned to work as part of a team. The hardest part of the job was working throughout the holiday. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find what they were looking for.
good,"Fun place to go work. Very easy and at times fast paced store.i love the Halloween rush and balloon counter the best. Everyone works together as a team,it's great"
good,The job was okay. It kind of had poor management. I learned how to run cash and how to communicate with customers. The job environment was fun.
good,Got along with all the co workers and management. hardest part of the day would of been upsetting costumers because we were out of the costume.
good,"Before Party City bought out Halloween City it was an amazing ride.. As the DM it is CRAZY during the season. I tell people 2 things about this job. It is the most insane, crazy 5 months of your life. from the time you set up and merchandise to tear down at end of season and managing 6 stores plus helping weaker districts and helping train everyone in such a short amount of time is the hardest and best experience at the same time. But somehow it was ALWAYS FUN. Then party city got involved and it just went downhill FAST i mean faster than the FLASH! they went all corporate and rule crazy in an industry that was all ready insane they just made it harder."
good,A typical say at work for insisted of blowing up tons and tons of balloons. Helping customers with their decorations. and cash handling
good,"It's a typical retail job. Not a fast paced job. You'll be on your feet, ladders, and working with balloons a lot. Customer service is required."
good,"Slow work environment unless its holiday season. Fun management and co-workers, hardest part was cleaning that big department store the funniest part was blowing up customers balloons."
good,Was a good job with very unstable hours. Assisted in choosing  then fetching Halloween costumes for children & their families.
good,"Typical day at party city was fast pace and crowed. i learned how to plan-a-gram , basically set up the displays. Management was not the best but wasn't that bad."
good,Fun job really great work environment. Bad management in webster.
good,cleaning zoning hepling hand party planning getting ready for halloween
good,I loved working here. I loved the people that I got to work with. We all understood that we were a team and that we needed to work together to get things done. However the management was either non-involved or too strict depending on the shift.
good,"I liked working there. Other then the pay and not much hours overall was a really fun place to work. The co workers were great and nice and helped me out when I needed it. My managers were cool and decent. A typical day was talking to customers, making sales, stocking, cleaning, cashier, and that's it really. The hardest part of the job would be Halloween time, things get hectic and you have a lot of parents complaining about the costumes."
good,"Working at Party City was a great setting for a fun and productive job. All the party supplies, Halloween costumes, and much more. Helping customers with kids picking a costume was what i enjoyed most, seeing them walk out happy and excited with their costume. hardest part working there would be dealing with some co workers that would see how busy we are and not move fast or help out in any type of way which is very stressful. over all its a great place to pick up some customer service skills."
good,"Have worked at HC, 2 years in a row,, enjoy my fellow workers and friends out of workplace w/many,, great for giving extra hours if available, only bad thing,, it's seasonal,,,"
good,rewarding to help kids find their customes
good,"I loved working for the company, it was a very calm place to be (despite the chaos with large crowds of customers). I found it very easy to adjust to the system and follow the rules. What I was not fond of was the unison between the Managers. There were several managers to work with who each held different levels of concern for the rules, some managers were very strict with the rules and others were not as strict. My co-workers were very friendly and most of them were very reliable. I learned many things from the job; such as learning to deal with difficult situations and rude customers and how to think outside of the box to create helpful solutions."
good,"During a typical day at Party City I meet and greet new customers, make them feel comfortable while I help them meet their party/shopping needs. I learned how to interact with the public in a friendly manner and how to upscale sales. I enjoy working with my co-workers, they make every day interesting and enjoyable. The hardest part of my job is not having enough of one popular product to sell to everyone in need. What I most enjoy about my job is making people smile, and give them a stress free shopping experience."
good,"This company is wonderful as a starting job for most people. It teaches responsibility, time management, project coordination, and team work. The downfalls are the inconsistency with quality from the coworkers and the lack of managerial instruction."
good,"Very fun to work during the holidays, but the managers hide in the back so they don't have to deal with their customers. Managers didn't prepare me for the oncoming customers who wanted their costume a couple of hours before Halloween"
good,"learned how to be on cash, floor, coming in at 6am to do stockings and unboxing and at the back doing the costumes. Provided a lot of customer service, balloon orders and making balloons. Learned how to be very fast paced at what I was doing and most importantly having fun!"
good,"I genuinely enjoyed my time working at Halloween City despite it being only a seasonal position. The job itself was relatively simple, and the workplace was decently organized."
good,"Flexible hours and fun workplace with options to take classes (yoga, strength training) at the gym during lunch time to improve your well being and productivity."
good,Nice place to work at and really fun place to work at for halloween and all the holidays i would work there again  i would tell my friend about working there
good,"Some days it was a relax work envoriment along side other co workers but other days it was stressful and harsh environment. Management gave me a hard time by mistreating me. Thankful, coworkers were nice, welcoming, and easy going."
good,"The people were cool. The job was calm & very fun. If I could, I would do it all over again. It was easy . My co workers were  also very cooperative. The job itself was enjoyable ."
good,"I enjoyed working at Halloween city very much, I learned how to stock and take inventory, management was helpful and dedicated, the hardest part of the job for me was not spending my whole paycheck on merchandise! One of the most enjoyable/fulfilling parts of the job were seeing the kids pure joy and excitement for the costumes they were getting."
good,"Typical day consists of going in, clocking in, getting assignment(s). Could be setting up displays/merch, running register, fielding customer questions."
good,If you are in high school or college it's a great place to work at because they are flexible with your availability and work around your school schedule.
good,"Probably the only job I have had where management was organized, and it felt like a family setting(occasionally). Kudos. The pay isn't much but it's for the holidays, get your money while you can."
good,"Realizar decoracion, atencion al publico, correo Online, ubicacion de la mercancia. "
good,"I helped all people find costumes, for Halloween. Breaks were only 15 minutes long. I worked at least 8-10 hour days, and after they used me for seasonal, they just cut me off the schedule."
good,Good selection of party supplies. High prices. Staff can be judgemental and unhelpful at times. Management is scarce. Hard to find the things you're looking for.
good,"It's a good starter job that got me to end up being a assistant manager. However, I would of like to see more happen to other employees who wanted to be moved up instead of passed over."
good,"it was a cool store, the management was laid back. but i work here 3 yeas ago so the store may have change, but my experience was something, my first job I stayed the longest"
good,Fun job. Mainly put new product on the web page for clients to be able to purchase and view items an be able to purchase via online. Also support an trouble any issues within the web page.
good,You would come into work and find a mess from the shift before and had to clean it up along with trying to finish the list that was left for you to get done.
good,"customer service, stocking, ordering, plan-o-grams, opening and closing store."
good,"I only worked a seasonal job at Party City, but while I was there the team was very fun and engaging and helpful. I learned how to speak to customers and work on a great team. I wish that I could have worked past my seasonal position. Also, the year after I tried t reapply for the same position and found it hard to navigate since I had worked there before."
good,"Workplace was good but sometimes it was hard to handle with customers. Helped customers find merchandise, organized merchandise and ensured store cleanliness."
good,"Fun and friendly place to work, good part time job for students either in high school or college. A typical day at party city involves customer assistance and helping customers locate products and stocking shelves. Co-workers and managers are easy to get along with, very easy-going job. The hardest part of the job is not having enough hours as a part time worker but the best part of the jobs is the relations and the people you meet working here. I enjoyed my time working at Party City because I learned a lot about customer service and became a better sales associate. I enjoyed building friendships with the people I worked with and also the people I have met since I started working with Party City."
good,"Worked Part time Only "
good,i liked it at first but then it got crazy. it was unorganized and low paying job for to much work. it just wasnt enough for me.
good,This was one of my favorite places to work. the atmosphere is almost always cheerful and bubbly. I always looked forward to the new seasonal merchandise that would come in.
good,I enjoyed working at party city. I worked as a seasonal during the busy hours which is Halloween and a fast pace area. They decided to keep me after the season was up as a part time coworker. I went in one day to get my schedule and they said they didn't need me anymore because business wasn't what they thought it would be.
good,"-clean work space, fill balloon orders for morning hours, stock shelves"
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers at the check out line and asnwer their questions as best as possible. Help customers find what they need and direct them to the right location. "
good,"When I worked here, I enjoyed my time helping people get ready for parties and Halloween. The hardest part was tying the knot for the balloons and getting scars on my hands from them. The best part was making someone very happy about their preparations for a fun night."
good,"Got to meet new people, fun place to work, especially around holidays, The pay is on the low end but a nice 2nd job or extra money job,"
good,Little stress full around the holidays. Really push to work faster and faster when you think your going fast.However it was still fun at Halloween because we all got to dress up
good,Typical work day at Party City was busy everyday for any kind of party theme to help out a costumer party ideas. I learned teamwork with my coworkers and stock up items. The management. was okay while working there. My coworkers were nice to know and cool working with everyday. The hardest part of the job was dealing with hard headed costumers and helping them out with what they were looking for. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting paid.
good,"party city was my first job so I wasn't sure what too expect. coming in to party city it was fun and pretty cool I had some great co-workers and some that wouldn't say anything too me. a usual day at party city come in stock, and re-stock shelves do some maintenance work, janitorial duties and then the manager would ask me too do the cashier or I would pull carts from the parking lot."
good,"need a great memory because the sale floor is always shifting, and you can not leave register to refresh memory for better guidance when directing inquisitive customers. policy is a great wall, do  not try to get away with any rule breaking termination will follow, verification for personal checks, helium balloon ordering ect."
good,Management was a complete joke at the time and did nothing to really try and keep associates interested in the company
good,"typical day would be like assisting customers with any inquiry about a product. Sales associates are required to work register. You also get freight from the back and stock it on shelves."
good,"Party City is a unique place in the industry of retail mainly because of the products it provides. Everyday is another day to expect families, friends, co-workers of all shapes and sizes coming into a Party City store looking for anything and everything they need to have the party that they desire. Party City provides a lot of work such as keeping up with the seasons when displaying all the party store goods for holidays such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, New Year's Eve and especially Halloween. The team that you'd be working with are seeking the same goals as you are; the success of each customer finding what they to give their parties that ""zazz"" everyone wants to see."
good,Party City was a great place to work for the holidays. I was working for only a month. I really don't have much to say. 
good,I worked for Party City all through high school. It was the best job ever. Halloween season was a drag at times but the most profitable season.  
good,"Wonderful first job opportunity but no advancement within the company. The management was fair, and the co-workers were always changing."
good,A typical day at work was really busy
good,Halloween was a crazy time to work there. But I made it. And then went back for a second one.
good,"It's a very highly rated company, customer can be very rude but over all the company is a very nice place to work for"
good,"Open store and review paperwork, check emails on task to be done throughout the day as well as sales goals. Take out tills and set up registers for the day. Get in to zone and do lows and out (inventory) as well as provide customer service"
good,It was mostly a very energetic place to work. Co workers as well as the manager were friendly. The employee discount definitely came in handy when buying my child a costume a week before halloween. Overall it was a good learning experience and i would definitely work here again.
good,"Working at party city was a great experience to have as a sales associate, the overall company was a great and mood lifting environment and a great sales team!"
good,It was an OK job I have had better and the management there wasn't the best and they could work on communicative skill but other than that it was an OK job I wish I could go back and fix that whole store but its too late now.
good,typical day consisted of answering phones and being on register and at times balancing the two. providing each customer with knowledge on store and online products. helping with balloon orders and having items on hold and gathering materials that customers have pre ordered or shipped to store so its ready for quick pick up. hardest part was being treated like management but actually was not at this job. most enjoyable part was the balloon area and getting to know exactly all the products that you can get at party city because i really did not know all  that they had to offer
good,The company is great . It is the people not showing up to work that made my time unhappy sometimes . But i thought it was a wonderful start to my working career and i really enjoyed my time there and would definitely go back this year .
good,"I worked at Party City as a teenager, it was a simple, fun, and easy going job. There was not much opportunity for advancement in this type of career field."
good,"Working at party city was something different compared to other retail jobs.I learned to do planograms ,worked the balloon counter and customer service.there was always something different to do."
good,"I had a great time working here with my fellow coworkers. Everyone was always very friendly and looked out for one another. The Halloween season is very busy and fast paced, but its really fun helping people pick out their costumes."
good,"Work can be long, but it's usually busy. I'm almost never bored . I can tie balloons quickly and help people plan parties well. The hardest part about the job is being able to multitask."
good,"Working at party city as a sales associate was great. Especially during one of the most busiest times of the year, Halloween. Working at party city really helped me become a better person when dealing with customer service all around."
good,"Learned how to use a cash register"
good,"Help Desk was a good team environment."
good,Everyone is very friendly and willing to help. Management was always willing to help you with whatever questions you had. Customs were always happy and had a great time shopping with us.
good,I loved this job for all ive learned about myself as a worker and what I am capable of. I got over my fear of cash and also learned my strengths. Loved working during Halloween time as i was always moving.
good,"A normal day at work may include accounting, costume management, freight management, cashier duty or balloon inflation, depending on the hours. Provided one does the minimum--meet the email percentage quota or complete the necessary tasks for the day--the atmosphere can be fairly laid-back, Halloween and holiday spikes notwithstanding. Holiday traffic and customer problems tend to encompass much of the stress and issues. Corporate tends to be very demanding, and can make decisions that become very consequential or detrimental for the operations end. Increasing features provided by retail evolution means that associates and managers are given more breadth of responsibilities; be advised of this trend depending on how pay raises operate in different areas, as they are so far relatively acceptable in New York, they may not be elsewhere or in the future."
good,easy job. management was laid back. Hours were sporadic. hardest part was pulling costumes when it's really busy. it was really fun working during halloween season.
good,enjoyed working there relaxed atmosphere customers were always number one to our management and associates staff many party ideas were available  staff worked well with each other
good,"It was interesting place I would suggest this place of work for high school, college students, and people who wants a quick check. The staff and employees made it a great place to work."
good,Just have to be a fast and hard working to make sure all costumers get what they need in a good time. With the 4 works they give for one shift they have to make sure we do team work
good,"This would be a good place to work at if you are in the market for a temporary job. The people are friendly and the pay is pretty good, but not enough to make it on your own with only one job."
good,As someone that how's worked for Halloween City multiple years. it's a peace of cake just remember Head to Toe customer service with every outfit. Management and corporate are normally super easy to please. I go back year after year just do to the fact easy money.
good,"Seasonal employment so not much to be expected in the way of security or advancement opportunities, but overall a fun place to work with friendly staff and a steady work load that increases closer to Halloween."
good,"A typical day working at party city involved running back and forth to the back to get the costumes, which wasn't hard at all it was actually fun. i learned that having patients is actually something you really have to have when it comes to working at party city especially during halloween time. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the kids and adults happy at the end of the day when they got their costumes and accessories, some of them even came back to see me."
good,"Worked for party city since 2005. They always took care of me and I was able to make ends meet. With that said I wish there were more pay advancements, raises are hard to come by, but when you're a single parent with a full time job sometime 9$ and hour just doesn't quite make it. However I learned a lot with party city, I learned a lot about people and in customer service e you have to put yourself in the customers position and party city taught me that."
good,work life is ruled by deadlines. always last minute and more work than time allowed. department managers are not given the opportunity to manage or coach. just work.
good,"Good place to work, company went public and had major cut backs in salarys. They restructured management through out the company and had many layoffs in the stores and at corporate."
good,"I love working at party city , but only problem I had was that they didn‚Äôt want to give enough money to make me manager and I felt 8.00 is not enough and not fair to anyone and I know I worked really hard to get a better pay but I ended up leaving"
good,Management often spends more than 80% of their time on tasks rather than training or developing subordinates or staff. The best part of the job has been the experience with customers. Everyone that enters our locations is looking to have a party so developing a rapport with those individuals is easy and enjoyable.
good,"The help desk at Party City is a very competitive place to work, everyone is competing to close more tickets than the other and it makes for a fast paced and fun environment to work in"
good,"The work was typical retail stuff. I really enjoyed the people that I worked with, but staff and magement change often. Gets very busy at certain times of the year. Was not much opportunity and wages were low."
good,Worked with the company on halloween and it was a very fun place to be at. I helped customers select products that best fit their personal needs and educated them on product and service offerings.
good,"It was seasonal so it was really busy but it was fun. I learned a lot about talking to people. The management was fun to be around they really connected with you, and wanted to get to know them. The hardest thing on the job was climbing and getting stuff off the top shelf. The most enjoyable part was meeting the new people and looking at all the new costumes."
good,Party city was a good starting point after school or during school. On the weekends it was busy but during the weekdays it was slow. Managers were nice and helpful.
good,"I would've worked here for longer, had I gotten paid more, and gotten more hours. My coworkers were my 2nd family, and I spent 5 good years there. I'd go back if they'd increase their wage"
good,"I worked here for about a year and I loved the busy season and all of my fellow employees. One of my managers at the time has continuously moved up since then, and it's definitely a fun place to be! The busy season is Halloween but after that it dies down a lot. The pay was decent as well, I only left because I had a far drive and it wasn't worth the commute."
good,Stayed busy for the most part. Had a lot of customers almost everyday. The only thing it was kind of more seasonal but not. Sometimes did not have enough hours.
good,"This place is a fun job, especially for someone who loves helping other with party planning. Overall things go smoothly but when it comes to balloons you need to make sure your on it."
good,"Working at P.M. Parties I further strengthen my time management skills and abilities to handle heavy work loads with accuracy. "
good,"The job itself is quite easy, but the store fails to work as as team to complete tasks. Most staff members lack motivation and drive to initiative to keep the store neat and organized."
good,"As it was a seasonal job, I didn't spend much time there, I was a part time employee and a full time student. It's a job for teens, and if you are a hard worker you can guarantee you will be doing the majority of the work as the kids like to hide in corners and use their cell phones, chat and ignore all responsibilities given to them."
good,"This was a seasonal job that I worked during October/November for Halloween. I was a stock clerk and I assisted customers. The store would get busy at times, but I worked very well with my co-workers."
good,"It is a productive place to work. Also, it is great for students who go to college , they have a flexible schedule. You get to work with kids, help them with their birthday parties . Overall it is a great place to start."
good,"Cashier, greet customers as they enter & exit the store, stock and replenish items, inventory control, opening and closing procedures."
good,At work at party City was interesting I work on the sales floor and i organized the shelves. I learned how to be fast and efficient. working with my co-workers was interesting and fun.
good,I was a cashier my duty was take customer payment also i take call in order . helping customer was  main part of my job make sure they get what they want .
good,Working closely with customers. There is a lot of people during this season so you need to learn to stay calm and just help one by one
good,"A typical ay at party city is very calm, it kind of goes by slow because there is not much to do. I learned to have good customer service skills which helped me in the long run with my current job. Management was fair to all the employs. All the people who worked in the store got along real well together, and worked well with one another. The hardest part of the job was around Halloween time, because that is when party city's busiest season is. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to wear costumes while working on the clock."
good,The job its self isn't bad. The people are not always the greatest but my gm is great. They are slow with fixing problems with pay check stubs. The easiest thing there is blowing up balloons. There is not really any thing hard about the job.
good,Party city was the best job I had personally but it was only seasonal I was told I would be kept as a sales associate beyond seasonal but I was lied to and treated unfairly and didn't not receive the position ...They used me for my skills and dumped me off like I never existed and I was told I was Angel excellent worker...I was told that they couldn't keep me or anyone else do to them not having enough store hours only for that to be a lie and they laid me off unfairly nor was I able to receive unemployment even after I was kept beyond 90 days...I would NOT recommend anyone to work there the whole management was deceitful evencorporate was involved with the mistreatment of the employees...I hated to be laid off and lied to but you live an learn!!
good,Fun people and work place. I worked for this company for 3 years every Halloween season. Love this location and the staff members. I would recommend this as a place of employment.
good,"typical days at work would be selling items , i learned how to deal with customers , my co workers were cool so was the manager"
good,It was a cool place to work but was very drama filled. The people there don't know how to split their personal and professional life apart.
good,"Party City was a nice place to work at. It wasn't very busy during week days, sometimes not even on the weekends. It was a very slow work environment, but always something to do. The only busy time for Party City is Halloween."
good,I enjoyed working here. Sometimes the work area was fast-paced and sometimes it was slow. most of the employees were great to work with.
good,"Working at Party City kept me on my toes most days with customers and balloon orders and stocking shelves, but some days were long and dragged on due to little work that needed to be done. Management was easy to work with and get along with but they favored higher ranked employees. Things I would get in trouble for assistant managers were able to get away with. Some of my co-workers were fun and easy to get along with, but most were a little more conservative and stuck up, making things a little tense at times."
good,"On a regular day I spend most of the time cleaning up after children because of there irresponsible parents allow them to grab whatever they want break it or tear it then just throw it on the floor and i just smile and clean up.I learned patience is a skill and organization is a must while working in a Halloween costume retail store and it also requires all the mental strength a person has because you see how much people do not care about things that do not belong to them.Well the management is not that great because they do not know how to take into consideration that a employee might know something that they do not about the store that the manager is new at and the employee has been at for 2 years at that time. Co-workers are the best part of the job, they know how you feel whether they are working the cash register, working in the backroom, or the fitting rooms. They see how ignorant some of the customers are with trying to steal breaking stuff and being oblivious to how horrible there children are being. The hardest part of the job is when it is a few days before Halloween everything gets crazy we run out of items that everybody seems to want, we stay with a line wrapped around the store for check out and fitting rooms, and half the merchandise it broken or missing parts because of someone stole it or there child broke it it's frustrating but that's where your patience becomes a skill. I would say the most fun we have is when we are closing for the year and we are taking down everything and any merchandise that is damaged we can take plus the manager bring lunch we just"
good,"Well to start I would have to say that Party City is quite a grand and fun experience. Everyday we encounter many unique people with just as unique questions and request. You learn to be patient and a bit creative with each person you interact with, customer and co-workers alike. And creativity definitely comes along way here at Party City; customers will always ask for your thoughts on what they could add or change to their parties, events, or costumes ideas. Normal days mainly include working out product(aka freight), recovering the store, inflating balloons, answering phone calls, and running the front/ registers. My fellow co-workers are probably the best I've interacted with at any job I have held thus far. We all get along great, we push each other to do our jobs well, and we learn from each other; teaching each other new things we can add to our skills. Which I would have to say is maybe the second most enjoyable part at my job next to trying to be creative with customers. Management despite going through a sudden management transfers; the new managers are still great to work with and very understanding. Ironically I find trying to be creative with customers sometimes a bit difficult, despite enjoying it. Nine times out of ten whatever idea you may pitch to the customer , they may have already thought of and so they just may pass on any more ideas you may have concoct. Overall Party City is a fun place to work at and I definitely recommend applying."
good,"Worked with the real estate community to locate new and relocation opportunities.  In addition negotiated lease renewals for my territory of 8 states.  Hardest part of the job was the negative attitude of my supervisor, I am a positive person and he unfortunately is negative most of the time.  I love working with people and seeing my work turn into good deals for the company.  I like traveling and have great knowledge of many states.  I am accustom to working whatever hours are needed to get the job done.  My operations background helps my real estate selection process."
good,"Loads would come in on the trucks. I would use a pallet jack and other equipment to remove the boxes. They are checked in for accuracy. Boxes are then opened and I would stock the section that related to what was in the box. "
good,Party City Corp. was a great place for someone to gain working experience
good,a typical work day was good very few customers through out the day.I learned that everyones expectations are different. Management could of been better. The co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job is meeting the customers expectations. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customer walk away with what they wanted.
good,"At our store in Harvey, La. is can be very busy.  We are a mega store, which means our store has more selections than most of the stores in the franchise.  As part of the management we all work together.  I would say the hardest part of the job is during some of the transitions(going from one season to the next), never any down time."
good,"You stand,walk and bend for long hours. I enjoyed helping kids and parents find customes. Managment did the same as employees and employees did what managers did. Everyday was a different project and different task to be done and thats what i loved most about working with them every hallowwen season."
good,the job was great I wish I could have started when they first open seems like getting payed every week would have been better and giving everybody equal hours.
good,"This is an amazing place to work ,but the only hours of operation is during the fall season"
good,"A typical day would consist of putting out freight and customer service. The upper management didn't communicate very well or clearly to lower management. Because of the pay and the environment the co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job would have been during Halloween, however, this would have been also the most enjoyable past as it's very busy and there is always something going on to keep you occupied."
good,"It's a fun place to work, but halloween is mandatory overtime for management."
good,"Put costumes up from the day before, learned how to help upset customers. Manegment was good helped out with any questions. Co-workers we great helped eachother with anything needed. Hardest part was trying to make angry customers happy with out bending or breaking our polices. Seeing how the work enviornment and customers enjoy the time."
good,"I enjoyed working at party city because i liked being around people helping them and greeting them. I also learnt a new skill, making balloon bouquets. My co-workers were fairly cool easy going .My managers were also very nice. A typical day consisted of working the cash register dealing with cash transactions, debit card, and checks."
good,"Learned how to manage time, and to be patient while working."
good,I enjoyed working for party city. The management was very willing to bend to the needs of their employees.
good,"Fun and enjoyable place to work at. Would help customers with questions, answer phones and clean the store on a daily bases. Management for the most part were fun and fair. Great co-workers to work with."
good,Loved working there had fun and didn‚Äôt just feel like work flexible schedule managers were very understanding and gave u as many hours you were available
good,"It was a easy job, only for the month of October to help with Halloween orders, we worked long hours but it was fun to see everyone with their kids and family"
good,I enjoyed my experience there at party city. I left due to the reason I wasn't getting enough hours to support my living. I hope my future job with put me to work and have an amazing environment.
good,"I had a great work experience there, my position was only seasonal but if they ever needed me back, I would definitely consider going back. So overall great place to work"
good,"Loved this job, it was fun but could be exhausting depending on the season but that's comparative to most retailers. The culture was nice. Management was supportive."
good,"It was an ok job, honestly it was something that got me by but it wasn‚Äôt my choice of work I‚Äôd prefer to be in a construction type job with a lot of movement and activity because of my energy level but party city‚Äôs warehouse was heavy lifting boxes and it was ok"
good,"Party City will introduce you to many different customers, so it is a good place to start to learn essential customer service skills. The jobs vary from cashier, on the floor, or in the back. You'll learn a lot of different skills needed for different jobs so this certainly is a good place to start."
good,"I am really glad they hired me because it was my first job even though it was only seasonal. The managers are really fun and easy to get along with. You can go to them for help no matter what, just keep being respectful and do what you were asked."
good,This job required the person to have energy as the store was full most of the time. It required a lot of knowledge as to where the merchandise was stored at.
good,Was really good when I first started then they started demanding that we got to different locations to help them clean and box a few things. It would have been fine if we were paid a decent amount
good,It was easy not hard. Fast pasting durning Halloween not a lot of work usually to be done besides a little bit of freight here and there. Nice employees and were always on their feet. A regular day at work would be helping customers and putting things back that dont belong in that spot.
good,"Learned how to work organized and learned how to have  great customer service, was responsible for three separate isles I would have to maintain and restock and fill everyday. Learned to do register, and was responsible for making sure the safe and registers was all taken care of"
good,"I have always enjoyed working at Party City, but not so much here at the Opelika, AL location.  I took a diminished role as assistant manager and myself and the general manager did not see eye-to-eye on many things."
good,Working at Party City has taught me many great life skills. I recommend working for Party City if you are looking for a challenge in the specialty retail field.
good,"Decent place of employment, good flexible hours, there was always opportunity to take on more hours. Part time consisted of 30 hours minimum and pay was bieekly, very good place to hire younger people"
good,it was a fun work environment and i enjoyed coming to work. though you have to listen to the same 5 or so songs on repeat but other than that it was nice.
good,"The employees had no home training "
good,"Everyday was a new experience from stoking items, working the cash register, helping clients, working the balloon counter, taking calls and opening or closing the store. I learned a lot about retail and how it works and how to work with new people. The hardest part of the job was definitely the holiday rush, Halloween being the most challenging followed by Valentine's Day. To me, these were the most enjoyable days since it was so busy."
good,Working there was fun. The environment was welcoming and the job itself was entertaining. I feel as though our management however has slacked greatly.
good,"During my time at Party City, I wasn't always up on register but while on register my tasks were to help to ring customers out, answering the phone, I was in charge of helping to complete balloon orders and most importantly cleaning up the front end and making it presentable. While on the floor I had tasks such as putting new product out on the shelf, creating new displays and zoning. Around Halloween time new tasks were added such as interacting with the customer a lot more to make them satisfied, while selling costumes we had to try our best to help and find the perfect one for them; there was always tons of people so we constantly had to on our feet and alert of what was going on. During my time at Party City I learned how to be a lot more patient and understanding of how the customers feel. I gained a lot better skills in communication and finding the best way to work conversations while dealing with an angry customer.One of the hardest parts of the job would be the employee drama."
good,.They where okay fast paced environment i didn‚Äôt really like working there too far from home sometimes when I got off the busses weren‚Äôt running from there anymore
good,"A typical day at work is a complete distruction. Everything isn't always where it should be, workers are very lazy and tend to become very irritable when it comes to jungling from place to place. The hardest part of my job was probably getting the hang of finding the right places for certain things while still having communication skills with the customers."
good,"Fun and busy workplace, especially on weekends. Customers are usually in a good mood planning for parties but can be rude about pricing. Overall, fun place to work and be creative (with balloon arrangements) and help customers put together good parties."
good,Loved the environment and people working there. I stocked the back during Halloween and the customers were overwhelming and often left costumes torn up and dirtied on the ground.
good,There is not much I can say other then the environment is a good place to work. If you want a lot of hours work around Halloween time. Customers are the best when they come in the store.
good,"This was my first job, so I don't quite remember too much from it. The workers, at the time were around my age so it made work more enjoyable. The managers were great too."
good,Managers were great!! Helped you understand your job and held you accountable which in my opinion helped working there go smoothly. The work environment was very welcoming and always Festive !
good,"Fast pace work environment, great employees and nice management. Costumes gets really busy and you have to keep it clean but overall working there was a great experience."
good,"Very busy during the holidays, so time went by fast. Made good friends while working there. Got great party ideas while helping others. The were helpful when it came time to donate to my kids school."
good,The best part about working here was blowing up the balloons. Everyone was nice and verging welcoming. Everyday was easygoing. There was no hard part about this job everything was very understanding and simple.
good,"Easy to learn each position "
good,"Most days it's the same thing, the same routine and it does tend to get a bit boring, but working with the right people makes it bearable the days go by fast. Managers are great, helping and giving feedback when needed. The most enjoyable part is being able to help a customer make the party/wedding/baby shower ect..memorable."
good,I got along really well with my coworkers and the higher-ups. One thing that I really liked that none of my other sales jobs had was the walkie-talkie. It made assisting customers a million times easier because all I had to do was ask over the walkie instead of having to walk to the registers and ask them in person.
good,"Party City is a fun and relaxed place to work. Merchandise changes by season/holiday so it can also be fast-paced and is sales driven. Good customer service is a must, along with the ability to resolve any customer issues that arise. I would recommend Party City as a good first job for anyone."
good,The management at our local store is fantastic; the people that work in the store is the reason for continuing to work there. I enjoyed working with customers as well.
good,"Personally, I really enjoyed working at Party City. However, I worked there as a high school student just trying to make some pocket change. It was often just one employee and one manager so, you‚Äôre really being pulled in every direction. And the company is very stingy with hours. I averaged probably 12-15 hours a week apart from the Halloween season. "
good,This was my favorite job I‚Äôve had. I wish they had full time hours and I‚Äôd probably still work here. It‚Äôs such a fun place to be. I highly suggest working here especially if you‚Äôre in high school.
good,"It was an overall good experience. Management did change a lot throughout my time there. It is a good entrance level job, but there is little room for advancement."
good,I've learned a lot from working here from customer satisfaction to being the best manager I can be. It is a fun work environment and I like the fast paced environment.
good,Working at Party City was a seasonal job but fun nonetheless. Management were very understanding and always around to help the new hires. The training new hires underwent was very thorough with what was where and what was needed to be done and how it should all be handled.
good,"I enjoy working at Party City because it‚Äôs pretty relaxed but during holidays it‚Äôs pretty busy. I meet new people every day , i just dislike the salary."
good,"The positon I held was front end cashier which helped me to have good customer service. This was a fast paced, fun environment, that allowed me to have multiple task"
good,"Party City was a huge learning experience an it still mind boggles me how people feel so much pressure. The customers are a give or take, their either super understanding or the other way but it's no problem to me when a customer is upset their easy to calm down and talk to once you put things in their perspective. A typical work day I was a cashier. It was very easy and I quite enjoyed it.The hardest part of the job was the time crunches, but the mot enjoyable was the customers when they've found everything they've needed and are satisfied with their visit."
good,"This store is always busy. There is always something to do, which makes the shifts go by fast. My co-workers are always happy to help when needed, and knowledgeable out the product. If I am not sure if we carry an item that a customer is looking for, we use a walkie talkie system, so we can communicate easily. Management is easily approachable, and we all get along nicely to work as a finely tuned team."
good,"The people I work with always have a positive attitude, the environment is friendly and inviting, and I have learned so much since I started at this company. Upper management really wants its subordinates to grow in their positions."
good,Party City is a good place to work at if looking for a part-time job with flexible hours. It's not to busy on weekdays. Saturdays are the most busiest days.
good,"I was with Party City for 5 years. I worked both at the St. Louis Park location as well as the Bloomington location. Both were great and management was good. It was a fun time especially at Halloween time, but only if you like the fast paced non stop work day."
good,"Very cool and interesting place to work. Fun to look at all the different costumes, masks and decorations. Very enjoyable to help people figure out who they want to be for the holiday."
good,I like working their so fair and there are some amazing people. After i went in to check on when i start they asked if i could start immediately. I like that they are so willing and able to let me start as soon as possible.
good,a typical day at work im usually just stocking and helping customers and if the cashiers are really busy go and open a register to help . the best part of the day is being at the register . the hardest part of the day i would say would be closing .
good,"Was a fun place to work, always something to do and fun experiences. Dress up for halloween and dress in new merchandise. Dress code was simple and comfortable."
good,This job gave me a great look at dealing with customers face to face on a daily basis. Great culture and great environment. A great first job to look forward too.
good,"I wasn't really there all that long but it was a cool place to work. When we shut down for the season, one of the managers let us take home one item of our choosing just because we worked so well for her."
good,"This job is a good way to get your foot in the door to gain customer service experience but not something to make a career out of.  It's a fast paced environment  and gets really hectic around the holidays, especially during Halloween."
good,A good job for part time seeking busy individuals. Would recommend this position for full time students as its manageable to maintain both school and this job.
good,"I worked part time at party city. I'd do cleaning, cash, stock or even set planograms. It is an overall fun job, the staff is amazing and welcoming. However, customers can sometimes be difficult."
good,The management is the least hands on I've ever experienced. The store is usually in disaray and the customers are lacking in empathy and apathy. They have little to no regard for safety and workers generally do whatever they want and tend to wonder on company time.
good,"It was productive because, i got to learn how to resd labels and tags to read tje item faster. It takes a lot of patience also. I learned to have patience with customers."
good,I worked at party city for seasonal during Halloween i really enjoyed it it was very fun and entertaining there was always something to do everyone had a gread attitude definitely recommend this job
good,This was my first job and so far it has been good to me. It already been already like 9 months since I been here. Sometimes it can be busy other times it‚Äôll be chill.
good,For my first job I didn‚Äôt know what to expect. It was fun But I don‚Äôt remember too much about it since it was so long ago. I got treat fairly just not the pay but for a first job I wasn‚Äôt going to complain.
good,"As a store associate for Party City, there were times when it was a fast-paced work environment and there were also times when it slow-paced work environment. Business was especially heavy around holidays."
good,Overall it is a good place to work. The only problem is poor hours and you get paid the minimum with very little benefits. No vacation hours or sick days.
good,The work day was fairly easy. Wasn't much hard work so to speak just stocking here and there and working the register. I learned more about working and helping the customer more individually. And then management was good.
good,Typically you come in and do your job. I learned never to be impatient and how to work a fast paced job. The management was okay need improving.The hardest part of this job was making balloons without popping them.
good,"There was always something to be done at party city. The manager was great and so were the employees but the customers can be a hand full. Other than the rude customers, it was a nice place to work at."
good,"Good place to work with friendly, helpful staff.  Gave me the opportunity to learn cash register procedures and become more comfortable dealing with customers."
good,It is a very good company to work for.  The atmosphere was friendly and the other employees were all team players.  Even though it was very professional it was also laid back and most customers left satisfied.
good,It got very hectic at times and became very fast paced especially around Halloween but very fun. The manager was awesome and worked with you if you had any issues or troubles.
good,i was there part time due to school.  my skills and my hard work moved up up fast as a shift lead.  open and closed the store and ran it by my self most morning or night with out the store manger present.  loved everyone that i worked with.
good,"Over all, Party City was a nice place to work at. The people working there are good people and work together quite well. My only issue with my time there was I was not given the hours I was promised and needed to survive and support myself. I started with full time, but my hours were soon cut and I was lucky to get 10-15 hours a week, if that. Because of which, I could not afford to pay my rent at the apartment where I was living and was forced to leave and move back home. I soon left party city for a better job with much more reliable hours."
good,"as a seasonal worker you are only there a week or two, if you like being kept busy then this is a great job.  being pstient with crabby people is a must for sure"
good,"Coworkers are great they are very helpful, the place is really good. Quick always make sure you‚Äôre doing something. Helping customers out. The bosses are kind ."
good,A typical was relaxed and somewhat quick-paced. I learned a quicker way to tie a balloon and ribbon together. I also learned that it a lot goes into decorating a party. I loved helping customers create their vision.
good,Most of the managers were great. The job was simple and not stressful. The managers tried their best to schedule you on the days you wanted and tried to give you the hours you wanted.
good,Working at Party City was a great experience that i am really glad that i did because i gained a lot of skills and experience in the retail genre.......
good,Fun to work at. Easy going. Flexible hours. Fast paced. Above minimum wage. Tying balloons is required. You get a 30% discount. Managers are very understanding.
good,"Its a fun family like vibe working here once you get to know your co workers but once around halloween or any major holidays but especially halloween it gets very crazy, a friemd of mime was a supervisor here"
good,"An easy place to work for anyone with a pair of hands. I simply work there so that I can make some money before getting a chance to begin my career, the work culture is great and everyone is friendly and I enjoyed the most busy, hectic work periods during the holidays."
good,"Party City is an excellent place to work if you are looking for something on the side for a little extra cash. The management is amazing and very cooperative and willing to work with your life and your schedule, and coworkers are generally friendly and fun. It is a slow-paced job, but there is always something to do. The hardest part of the job would have to be store cleanup, as there is so much product. The most enjoyable part of the job was making people's special occasions even more special and going out of your way to service them."
good,"Relaxed and Durable/fun"
good,"Working at Party city corporation was a good experience. I loved the diversity and positive vibes there. There were always smiles. A typical day was nice and fast paced around that time, but overall the job was okay."
good,there was never any major problems at party city jus the giant mess left to clean up afther the children run thru the store trying costumes and props on but overall it was fun socializing and help the customers find what was needed .
good,"My day was not hard I greeted and served customers which I enjoy very much, management was very fair and willing to work with staff when needed. Employee appreciation displayed"
good,Work was't hard except for Halloween and Graduation and I became good friends with some of my coworkers. Schedules are very flexible and work load was never too much.
good,"It was fun working at Party City, most employees worked well with one another. It was a good job for me at that time in my life, it served it's purpose. I would recommend this job to anyone who likes easy work, doesn't have to think too hard and maybe just has some time to kill. Not much of a future unless you go into management."
good,"A typical day at work to me would be very busy but a nice environment to be in. What I have learned with being at a job is that you can learn lots of things from new people that you've met at your work place, also others can teach you how to be a better employee and show what better things you can do to be great at the job as well. I would say the hardest part of the job would be when it comes down to my weaknesses far as making things take a little bit more time than it should be by being a perfectionist, but it also is a good thing when you're making sure that you keep track of the time for it to get done no matter what. The most enjoyable part of the job was that i was able to interact with customers and put a smile on their face and to be able to feel the connection with the customer and having an understanding on the ideas they were looking for."
good,The manager was a jerk but he was a hard worker the customers were always nice and decent the store it's self was awsome cause it was the place to get anything for a party or costume
good,"I was a consultant for these companies. My work varied depending on the needs of the projects and management. "
good,"The job was fun we set up displays, got to dress up and helped people find just what they were looking for. Kept a clean store and enjoyed the surroundings."
good,"Since I love Halloween, I found it to be a fun job.  There is a LOT of clean up because you have both kids and adult going through the merchandise.  So you are picking things off the floor and re-hanging the product pretty much constantly.  Knowing where things are makes things a lot easier,  So get to know the store.  Suggestive selling isn't hard because many costumes have so many accessories to go with them."
good,Everyone was very nice and polite. Managers were on top of things and very in tune to all our needs and to customers. Quick problem solving and easy management.
good,"Easy job constant work with customers and daily stocking. All jobs were fairly easy. Costumes were fun .Very understanding of my hours, I was pregnant at time of employment thus they worked very well with my limitations"
good,"Party City was pretty much a starting place to earn my stand in the working field. I tend to go back, but not to the sister stores they have. Most of the time with the sister stores, and not the larger ones you tend to get less hours, and they are usually farther behind in updates and technology."
good,"Very easy going, always something to do, fast pace at times, and very balanced, great benefits and a lot o ways to climb the corporate ladder, overall, great place to work."
good,"Party city is a fast paced employer, they only hire during halloween is when you get the most hours. After season is completed the hours get cutoff. Over all its a fun place and discounts are great."
good,Every one gets along well. You are family here. Management needs to step up their game. Hardest part is dealing with those rude customers who want stuff for free.
good,The pay was frequent as some were hired in the middle and late season. The environment was friendly. Once the season was over few were kept on as part or full time.
good,Overall it was a good job to assist me in my transition to the Army while I was waiting to leave for basic training. Good management ans quality people.
good,"During Halloween time it can be very demanding, fast paced, and extremely overwhelming. Do not work here unless you are quick on your feet and able to adapt to stressful situations all day long."
good,"they had stuff to do pretty mucht the whole time, there was never a time that you didnt have something to do or get done whole working there. sometimes it would be hard to find something to do"
good,"Was a fun and relaxed atmosphere to work, but position was temporary.  Traveled to other cities around the region and helped open 3 different store.  Was also promoted to GM position at end of position."
good,Fun seasonal work. Pay was terrible but the job itself was fun. ab cd ef gh ij kl mn. op qr st uv wx yz. the fact that you have to write a review on here is very redundant.
good,Fun place to work. Always something to do or customers to work with. Creating balloon bouquets was always challenging and interesting. Customers were fun and friendly.
good,"Stocked product, cleaned store. customer service, checked out customers.  Fun place to work. Halloween is the busy time of year.  Most enjoyable part is when I help a customer get the items to make their party the best it can be."
good,"It was a pretty fun workplace.There where hard days.The pay could have been better,but had semi good hours.The managers where nice to there coworkers.Easy Job"
good,Fun and interactive not only with fellow employees but also customers looking for fun and exciting party ideas. Halloween time is exceptionally fun with opportunities to dress up.
good,I loved that job. EVERYONE who works there always gives positive compliments and makes you want to go to work everyday. You learn a lot fast. It's a fun job.
good,"A typical day at Party City would involve making sure the store is presentable, while greeting and helping customers. I learned how to manage my time, stock and assemble display shelves, along with customer appreciation. The management was great, always there to help when needed. Working with others at Party City made it more enjoyable with friendly, hardworking employees. Hardest times at work would be around holiday's for balloon orders, but was also an enjoyable time."
good,I enjoyed working at Party City even though some Days were better then others.. not everyday is a good day. Everyone helped when needed. Management can sometimes be a pain can teach you a lot. Also staying long after closing to clean was a pain We'd even sometimes stays 3 hours after closing.
good,"This job has taught me how to be more patient with customers. On the weekends, the store gets extremely busy on the weekends due to the high demands for balloons. Sometimes we get 5 pages full of orders but us employees all work great together and get them all finished."
good,Everyday work was okay. Some managers were not fair with employees and i did not see myself growing with the company. It was not my career choice. I have gained more experience in customer service.the most enjoyable part of my job were the busy days where i was constantly on the go helping as many customers as possible.Also a negative part was the minimum amount of hours and was not possible for me to go fulltime when i needed the hours.
good,You must be willingly to frequently change your job requirements. There are constant changes that changes your normal schedule. There isn't much growth within.
good,"My days at party city consisted of putting away stock as well as being on a register."
good,"a typical day at work would be running the front desk as well as balloon orders, assisting customers, taking phone calls and making sure things was neat and tidy."
good,I thought that everything went okay for the most part.  They were not as flexible as they said they were with scheduling.  I was a high school athlete and asked if they could work around my schedule for my sport and they said they could.  When I came back to work they told me they sent in my termination paperwork.
good,"It is quite a small place, and the fact that all these people are grabbing costumes the last minute was too overwhelming for me. The most enjoyable part of the job is being to easily communicate with the managers. There was too much going on at once, and the fact that things were repeatedly put where they weren't supposed to be by customers was very aggravating. We provided friendly service and I tried to keep up my motivation, but the atmosphere drained me by the end of the month."
good,It was a positive work environment. There I was able to express all the qualities of a manger. I learned new skills that were specific to the job requirement.
good,"Company promotes good customer service"
good,i like working at party City it's great. But I'm looking for another job because I want to go to school and also help my family . At party city I would want to do open and for my second job is to close. I'm very fast at learning.
good,"Fun store to work at, there is always something new to play with and blowing up balloons is entertaining. Great managing team and mostly flexible with hours."
good,I learned while working at party city was that customer service is key and making conversations about what the customer is looking for is always a good idea.
good,"very fast paced work environment"
good,"My job at Party City was definitely my favorite job I have had. The job was incredibly simple to perform,but they always had somethig to do so the time would go by quickly. All of my co-workers were a joy to be around."
good,"The job was steady and easy going. My manager was really nice but didn't let that get in the way of her managing skills. Along with my manager, my co-workers were also nice people and very helpful when there was something I didn't know."
good,"This place has a lot of products to look at to help pass the time, but depending on the location it can be very slow paced. If it wasn't for the excellent co-workers the day would've dragged on."
good,party city has its time of fast paced work and its mostly around october. after that it slows down and its a regular store. i learned to work with all different people but mostly women and party planners not really a guy store.
good,"Extremely fast paced, especially for a first job. They give you a 5 minute rundown of what you need to do and then you have to attempt to handle many customers on your own."
good,"Although this job was seasonal, it taught me many things about customer service, as well as communication with customers both face to face and over the phone.  It was my job to ensure orders were on point and exact to fulfill the customers needs."
good,"Your day will consist of working with customers either on the sales floor, at register, or fulfilling balloon orders.This location has a great group of management. You'll feel very welcomed as a new employee."
good,A typical day at Party City consists of running the go-backs of customers who change their mind at the time of their purchase as well as things that do not get put back in their correct spot. My job as a sale associate at Party City was mostly at the cash register and signing them up for the store's email.
good,You can learn a lot about retail working here . Its work and fun at the same time. the most enjoyable thing about this job is all the great merchandise they have and the Halloween season.
good,Mucha diversidad y variedad para aprender y crecer laboralmente
good,I liked working at taco bell because it was a fast pace job so everything I was taught while working there I caught onto fast and easy. So everyday that passed by I was getting faster at making orders and better.
good,The store was a cool place to gain experience on how to deal with customers. It was small and quiet so it didn't give a lot of stress but it was very well handled
good,"Working here was great, but the management sucks! "
good,"Only downside are the customers for the area. Otherwise fun environment, easy going management. Intuitive systems in store so less training time and easy to pick up."
good,Working with party city was always a delight. I would come into work grab my walkie & then grab my drawer & head to the registers. I learned how to greet customers & thank them (courage to shall I say) as well as counting drawers & learning where stuff was around the store. Hardest part of the job was customers who wouldn't accept the solution you came up.
good,Seasonal position in a fast-paced environment working with Halloween inventory as well as stocking and assisting customers.
good,Very fun out going workplace. Loved my co workers and love that they worked with my school schedule. Getting creative to help customers create their Halloween costumes was so cool
good,It was a very good experience working as the General Manager for the first time. Building the store was the hardest part of the job I had never done anything of that sort before. We had to hire enough people to help me run the store in less than 1 month. We also had to train associates in time to get to know the merchandise and what we had to offer. I did not have a very good management team I could only depend on 1 out of 2 assistant managers. The best part of working for Halloween City was being able to gain experience in a different environment from what I was usto.
good,"Very productive, theres always something to do. Everyone works well with everyone and everyone helps each other. I've learned how to communicate better with customers, trained on register, and upstock and down stock merchandise. Management was very well, if you ever needed any help with anything there was no hesitation. There were times were customers would have there moments such as , being impatient, no manners, or just simply having a bad day. Thats any retail store and we tried to give the best customer service we can possibly give."
good,"Seasonal job which turned into Part time after the season was over. Good place but not enough hours for me. They had me stocking, register, customer service, and cleaning."
good,I've worked here previously and the best part of working for party city is friendships that are made. The team work is incredible and management always ensures that everyone feels included.
good,"Family friendly environment, was a fun time helping out families get matching Halloween Costumes. Reminded me a lot of my family which made it that much easier to be in that atmosphere. All the different selections and designs were pretty cool to look at and critique."
good,Party City iso a good stepping stone job. You learn about helping other both customers and other associatestuff. They work with the hours you are available to work and if there is a free shift they will check and see who would like to pick up some extra hours.
good,I had great co-workers and had fun working there. But during most of the year (when it wasn't Halloween) it was pretty slow and I prefer fast paced environments.
good,The Work Crew Been Nice & Easy To Get Along With . But the hours wasn't really that good probably for someone with no kids . I learned from working there it takes patients to handle customers.
good,"Party City was an energetic place, where there was rarely nothing to do. There were few times where there are less than 10 people in the store at any given time, aside from closing, and there were always fellow employees to help me when I needed assistance, or did not know what to do. I helped keep the isles clean and organized, though I also helped put costumes back into their packaging in the back room and put them away into their required boxes."
good,When i first applied to and went for a interview for party city I was nervous because this was my first official job ever and I was applying during one of their biggest holidays but it helped me grow as a person and a sales associate.
good,Enjoyable place to work if you don't mind certain things. Some days could be slow & nothing but back stock & cleaning. Other days could get crowded & we would get a store full of customers.
good,"tpical day at work"
good,Its a great place to work. They are flexible with your schedule and maintain a healthy environment. You wont get too bored working with different holidays.
good,"A typical day at work includes helping customers find products and help with planning their parties. I have learned a lot about sales from working here. management can be tough, but very reasonable for the most part. Co-workers are very kind people I get along with all 30+ very well. The hardest part of the job is the multi-tasking. We are expected to do quite a bit while helping customers and doing various other duties even management complains about this because the owner does not give enough work hours for management to work with on most days, so workers are spread fairly thin. The thing I enjoy most is helping customers.I never know what to expect with them. Some can be rude, but it is only because of stress caused from planning a party, so once you realize that it is a lot easier to help them. For the most part I usually get very kind customers and we end up having a good time figuring out their party needs which makes it an enjoyable experience for both of us."
good,Great place to work if you are just starting working. Great place to get retail experience for later in life. Overall a great work environment.
good,"fast paced, so many caring costumers and co workers."
good,"As a party store, its fun to see all the customers bringing in joy of hosting any kind of party, whether it be a child's party, a graduation party, or a 70th anniversary party."
good,For the time I was there I had a great time every single day. My co-workers were amazing and always found a way to make the job more fun.
good,"I was only here in October because it was a seasonal job. From what  I can speak on, it was a very fun job mainly because Halloween is my favorite holiday. Party City is where I first exercised my sales etiquette, making sure that I attentive and focused solely on the customer's needs. I prided myself on making sure that the customer was taken care of in a timely manner and left the store with everything they needed for a particular costume. It was very hectic up until Halloween day so good communication between teams were very important to eliminate confusion. The best part of the job was that to promote the Halloween season employees were allowed to wear some of the costumes and have props."
good,I loved this job. Its a great job for someone just now working. I worked good hours but still didn't get too overwhelmed. Made a few friends that I am still in contact with.
good,"I've learned a lot from working here, between planograms and receiving. The busiest time is halloween and graduation."
good,I enjoyed it and would go back if they needed help in the fall. I really enjoyed the people I worked with and they were very flexible with my school schedule which was really a plus.
good,"Typically I am usually on cash, so I will be doing basic check outs with customers as well as meeting their needs of why they came in to the workplace. Sometimes if I'm not on cash, I will typically be working on the floor so I will be on ladders pulling down stock and filling the shelves to make sure that everything is in good condition."
good,"I enjoyed working at Halloween City for the short time I did,(being a seasonal job). It was really fun, great environment and a great experience, I would gladly work there again."
good,"Was a great experience working with the management. Great work schedule even though it was part-time.I learned how to manage a register, how to effectively stock items in correct locations. Was given the ability to stay after seasonal work hire-on, and proved a great asset."
good,"It is a great environment to work but there is a lot of harshness. The typical day can take you on many types of emotions. I learned a lot about myself working here. I became a lot more open and sociable from working here,"
good,"It was a great place to work over halloween, leading up to Christmas. After the holidays I went from working 40 hours a week to not one shift for 2 months."
good,Fun and enjoyable workplace and cool people to work with. Very easy going job. Definitely worth working at. Had a lot of fun working there.
good,">Management was nice and professional "
good,"I would take the bus to work everyday before I had a car. I clock in, put my name tag on and get to work. I would re-stock party merchandise during and after we close, sweep the floor, and make sure all the merchandise are neat and organized. I've learned a lot of things while working at Party City not only at the store but also at home. I've learned how to organized merchandise, cleaning up, getting OCD about little mess. So when I get home, I would start cleaning and vacuum to make the room look clean. Here's the downfall to working at Party City.. I had this one manager he was awfully rude sometimes, it brings down my mood, and motivation to work. I won't get into details, but that was one of the reason why I stop working at Party City. The pros, my wo-workers. They're all so supportive, helping each other, and they're so fun to be around. I think that's one of the things that I love working at Party City. The hardest part to working at Party City is literally nothing. Last but not least, the most enjoyable part of working at Party City is getting a discount, helping customer finding their party needs, making a customer happy, and getting to working with my co-workers."
good,"i am always staying busy at my location, i work with great people and i am always having a great time. we are all a big happy family."
good,"I enjoy my job it sometime can get stressful but that's what i like about it never get's old, it always keeps me on my toe's. i love working with the customer. My co-worker are the best. What i learned from working at Party City, how to run my own business.I have a great DM. The hardest part of this job is when we can help a customer with there need."
good,it was a fun experience and the customers were utterly delightful although a few at times were a handful overall t was an unforgettable experience.
good,"The days were easy, nice and friendly customers most times. I would add that there could've been about a total of 5-6 people on the registers because it gets crowded really fast on holidays. there needs to be security guards in case some customers steal and want to get physical. the most fun part about the job is being there on Halloween being about to see so many different people in costumes and as well as the employees being able to dress up and still work,have fun."
good,"Everyone is always polite and respectful,  making it an easy place to be employed. The location is in a safe place so need to worry about unsafe areas and unusual guests."
good,providing a customer service for consumers in a party Supply store. Assisting with planning and decorations and supplies. Working on a cash Register. Party And Costumes supplies.
good,good place to work not hard to do and management was fair with your schedule and personal life just didn't pay enough... fun enviorment and great staff.
good,Once I got to the warehouse we had to meet up with our supervisor and be assigned to where we were going to work. From there we got to work.
good,"The weekdays can be slow. The peak business occurs on Weekends, Halloween, Valentine's Day, and New Year's Eve. You can earn decent wages but the prospect for advancement is very slim. Management overall is ok. They work with your availability and are very understanding of their workers' life situations."
good,A great place to work and learn the retail business. Also a great place to learn essentials skills required in the work place.
good,Fun positive work environment.  Great co-workers who are pleasant to work with.  I have learned a lot about different management styles and it has helped shape my management style.
good,Loved working there and meeting new people everyday and helping them find what they needed. A fun environment to be in and around!
good,"it was a good place to work, sometimes hard when staff try to test you limits."
good,"Enjoyed working with management and former coworkers, great place to develop customer service skills. Consistent with training and making schedules flexible."
good,I really enoyed working at holloween city. the manager was really nice and so were all the staff. its a great place. hardest part of the job was forgetting where where certain thing were when you just saw it. the most enjoyable part this job was working with people.
good,"I did this work only for seasonal because I was in high school at the time. We stayed pretty busy, but there was help whenever we had a question about something."
good,"Good place to work, friendly people for the most part. Management is very understanding of high school and college students and second jobs."
good,"This was my first job, and by far my favorite, The environment there was perfect with everyone coming in with smiles on their faces. My manager was a very nice person and all my co-workers also. The hardest part of the job was being on your feet all day just standing in one spot. My favorite part of the job was getting to see everything in the store and all the fun stuff around Halloween."
good,"I loved working at party city because you got to met some wild people and do some  creative stuff there. Only thing I didn't like was you had a few rude managers not only to the employers but as well to there customers a few didn't even really care you existed  and the managers had all the hours, after working there or a few month I started to realize most of these people our managers I was surrounded by them and I was working one day a week while and came to work and was ther with like 3 or 4 manager and it me and one other employee who feels the same as I do"
good,"I enjoyed working for Party City when I was there. I got along well with everyone, we were like a family. I learned so much and was so grateful I was given the opportunity to have a job after not working for so many years, and I proved myself. I was hired as Halloween help and after the holiday they decided I was valuable enough to keep on board. It was so much fun I really enjoyed it."
good,Fun atmosphere for college students. Good entry level retail experience for anyone who is trying to advance in retail.
good,typical day consisted of trying to sell customers Halloween costumes. Also cashiered and blew up balloons some days if a worker called off. Very fun environment around the holidays
good,Party City was my first job. I learned a lot from co workers about dealing with the public and work ethics. I was seasonal during Halloween and it was a blast with the kids and adults I helped.
good,Mainly stocked in the morning to try to avoid customers. Management is not bad. Flexible schedules. Good discounts. Not a bad job at all for the right person.
good,As a manager you work 10-12 hour days.  Daily you get to help customers plan parties from birthday parties to weddings.  It is always fun to take the customers ideas and turn them into reality.  During the time at Party City I have learned how to look outside of the box when it comes to planing parties and even merchandising.  There are 3-4 managers per store and each one is resposable for certain parts of the store.  It can be challanging at times but we work as a team.  The hardest part of the job is not letting yourself get involved in the many projects that are going on in the store and to make sure that the customers are still being helped.  The most enjoyable part is seeing the customers come back and thank you for helping bring their ideas together for the perfect party and they come back and want you to help them plan other parties in the future.
good,"I have learned a lot from this job. The management is great and extremely helpful and understanding. I get along with most of all of my co-workers. The hardest part of my job for me was when we were setting up the new store and I was putting stickers on everything. I felt like I was going to fall asleep at any minute. They have recently moved me to the cash register, I absolutely love it. I am such a people person so standing behind the cash register and getting to associate with lots of new people is the highlight of my day."
good,"very low hours and pay, management needed work, and work flow during the day was slow. Hardest part of the job was closing up and cleaning up the shelves."
good,The hardest part was to watch everyone some teenagers would go in there and steal what ever they could get their hands on so i had to keep a eye on them.
good,"You have so much to complete in one work day and no hours or time to finish. Poor corporation to work for, but the management was great we were like a big family."
good,"The team works closely with the US counterparts to learn and strategically aligns with their success stories.  Owned by Amscan, this was a great organization to get engaged and familiarize oneself with how to manage a category internationally."
good,"Management was great, but the amount of hours per week was not satisfactory. Maximum 20 hours a week, unless it was during the month of Halloween."
good,"A typical day at work for me is going in at 5:00 in the morning, pulling costumes, restocking the floor, taking a 15 minute break, and clocking out at 10:00 in the morning.  I learned a lot about retail, like what they do before they open (inventory and stock), and how a busy day at work can keep you on your feet at all times.  The management was awesome!  I had a pretty good job relationship with my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job for me was getting up and ready at 4:00 am, because I was not used to getting up that early for anything.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working there, and being a part of an awesome company with an amazing atmosphere!"
good,"Party City was a great experiences to learn different things. There were a lot of employees there, so I did enjoy getting to know new kinds of people. I would assist the floor with helping the parents, or the kids trying to find a custom for Halloween. We was so pack on the holidays, that's when I learn that I had to move fast and learn how to multitask. To be honest their where a lot of pressure but Party City taught me how to work well under pressure. So I learn a lot. Thank You Party City"
good,It was a great place to work and develop my skills and help me transition into more of an HR role. Great interaction with different types of people and personalities.
good,at this point it a job with no hrs or money and its not paying the bills..pay every two weeks and cant get bye on it..been there 6 yrs  usually like the job specially Halloween time when its season  after that its just ok lately
good,"Halloween City, the sister store to Party City, is a fun filled work environment that sells Costumes and accessories to customers. Although small inventory, no customer has ever had a complaint with our stock or staff. If there was an issue, I blame the District Manager, not the in-store staff. Our DM was very new to his position and could not handle his duties resulting in a payroll that was a week behind schedule and much inconvenience to his employees. One out of many incidents, I quit my position earlier than the ending season."
good,Workers and Managers are friendly and understanding but productive and encouraging.
good,"Party City is a very fast paced, constantly changing company. If you are self motivated like I am, then this is a great company to work for."
good,"overall a good and fun place to work. the atmosphere is relaxed and everyone is personable. "
good,Toughest part was building and tearing down new locations at begginning and end of season
good,"Most of my coworkers, and managers made me feel like an outsider."
good,"Atypical day at Party City includes handling with customers; the good and the bad ones. I learned how to act and present my self in a professional manner. My management is tough and hardworking, but they are understanding and overall fun to be around. My co-workers and I treat each other as if we were family. We share personal stories and laugh. The hardest part of the job is staying in sales associate mode when dealing with a rowdy customer. When someone is mad and taking it out on you, even if you did nothing wrong, its hard to not get mad at them. The most enjoyable part of my job is just how fun everyone is. most people are always happy and fun to be around. Plus its always fun to learn new things about retail."
good,"Worked for roughly 3 weeks as a seasonal employee for a temporary store as a stocker. Learned how to work fast while, stocking according to planogrms, answering customer questions and communicating with fellow employees."
good,"On a typical day at work I would begin at the balloon counter, which would always be busy during the day, taking orders from costumers both on phone and in store. Then in the afternoon I would be a floor salesmen and would frequently check my work area for organization and cleanness. My co-workers were all very pleasant to be around. The hardest part of the job was to stock up all the merchandise with ladders because of frequent relocation of the ladder. I most enjoyed interacting with the costumers."
good,Great place to work for if you're in management.  Enjoyable staff and co-workers.  Plenty opportunities to advance yourself within the company.
good,"Helped customers with costumes and planning parties"
good,It was a nice job. I only worked the Halloween season so you could imagine it was a pretty busy day. Evert got along and it was a good experience in customer service. There was a position for everyone to do. we stayed busy and there was no such thing as down time.
good,"Helping the Customers pick out Halloween costumes, making sure that customers are satisfied with what they purchased."
good,Typical day changes from day to day but its typical retail. You work at least 50 hours a week and depending on the holiday depends on how much work there is. The hardest part of the job is holding onto a permanent staff because employees only get minimum wage and they are asked a lot from them. The most enjoyable part would be the people you work with and just the work environment in general.
good,"I will either open or close the store, train employees, hire employees, paperwork, bank runs, counting down the drawer, sending people on break, making drawers, help customers, help guide employees. The best part about the job is the people I work with and getting to help others. The worst part would probably be working weekends and nights."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of taking care of customer needs and offering them help when ever they walk through the door, over the course of the year and six months I was working there I learned that It is wonderful when you enjoy your job and working in an place where you meet new people everyday. Management was wonderful, I loved my manager, all of my co-workers were great friends. The hardest part of my job would probably had to have been during Halloween when the store was crawling with people, we would get so busy sometimes that the line would wrap all the way around the store."
good,"Everyday at Party City is different. Some days you do stock and others you work the front counter which includes cashier duties and balloons. I learned how to be a member of a diverse team, time management skills, customer service skills, and I strengthened my work ethic."
good,Great opportunities for advancement if you are in the right area.
good,I enjoy interacting with costumers and answering the calls that come through.
good,i had a fun time working here. Filling up balloons was fun. My co-workers were fun to be with.
good,"open store , balance  safe review  deposits, set up cashier drawers, assign tasks, review e-mails do a walk through to be sure everything is in order and to be aware of any issues that need attention. Check in all incoming merchandise and place orders as needed. greet all employees and assign them to the days tasks. hire as needed.,Train new employees, oversee all activities involving the work place. At the end of the day make sure the store is ready to receive customers the next day. Balance safe, take deposits to the bank. Lock the store."
good,"Being a part of the management team is stressful, yet it still can be a fun job. A typical day would include doing the daily paperwork, taking in and processing freight, planogram revisions, and of course, customer service. The hardest part would be the days you are understaffed while being the only manager on duty. It can get stressful, but having fantastic co-workers makes the day enjoyable."
good,Management is very helpful and you are always kept busy. learned customer service for the first time.
good,"You come in and are given a task or job to complete or you are the main cashier. If you are the main cashier you are the last person the customer sees when they leave the store, so smile and have a postitve attitude to insure the customer had a good shopping experience. If you are on the floor you will probably be given frieght to be put out, a planogram to be reset, or moving merchandise. The hardest part is getting to know the store, for some people, people always are asking where things are in the store it is important and cofident you know what is sold in your store. The most enjoyable part is helping the customer find what they are looking for and making their party the best it can be."
good,it was fun working in party city watch people try on different outfit helping customers help them pick out what they needed
good,"Lots of favoritism going on there. But they do teach you a lot about cash registers, telecommunication, and customer service. It was a good starter learning experience."
good,in my time working for the company i got pretty good experience with customer service and the opportunity to do different types of task around the store. the managers and co-workers  where very helpful with the questions i had if any doubt and helped get through any difficulty a i could have during the time i started working for them.
good,"Good place for first job, great team work, but no opportunity to move up in company, which will eventually lead you to quit and look for better opportunities."
good,There's so much to do that keeps the job interesting and fun.
good,"With this being my first job, my co-workers were very nice and helpful. Everyone got along and I loved helping the customers decide which costumes to get. Overall this was a nice place to work."
good,it was my first job...i loved it...different seasons...decorations...etc great people and coworkers.
good,"A typical day at work was very fast paced, and involved lots of consumers through the holiday. I learned how to work with others in a faster paced environment than ever before, as well as working with consumers first-hand, Management was very excellent in training and preparing us for the hassle of the holiday season, and co-workers were excellent as a team. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the hassle some of the time, and the most enjoyable part would have to be working with the team, gaining experience, and overall experiencing a new environment."

good,I enjoyed working here because it really let me express different characters. It was a lot of fun for me and I made a lot of friends while I was working there.
good,The best time of year to work for Party City is Halloween. Besides dealing with crazy customers who go ballistic over something they're going to wear once Party City is a pretty chill and fun environment to work at. The hard part is making a seasonal position permanent.
good,You start out you day with taking care of previous days money.  Then you move on to the morning routine of down stocking certain areas.  After that is finished you are provided with two hours of ownership in your assigned departments.
good,Party city was very interesting. I served as a team leader and was able to learn many different aspects of the company. I had a great management team.
good,Busy all day.  Enjoyed working different store personnel.  Kept color coded filing system for different franchises.

good,"I love working here, they are so fun to be with and I like working with customers."
good,it was a good place to work in high school/ college. where i worked there was no room to move up the ladder
good,Any job is good in today's economy but this is not my kind of work. Extremely boring but I tend to keep myself busy with plenty of work while others just goof off. Hours are short and they only give you about 3 days a week of work.
good,"Nice atmosphere, great people. It is a fast paced environment, especially during event seasons."
good,"fun things"

good,"Good people, monotonous days.  Busy during Halloween, slow all other times."
good,"A typical day at work was stocking merchandise, helping and greeting customers. I learned to be motivated and postive and how to talk to customers. There was really no hard part to this job. It was very enjoyable."
good,I had to stock shelves and the busy Halloween Season made the shifts go by fast. I enjoyed assisting the customers with their needs.
good,"This would be my fourth year working at Halloween City and I enjoy it. This is a fun ""holiday"" for most people that celebrate it. You work with many different people, meet many different people and you can enjoy it as well. A typical day would be going in straightening up, stocking and assiting customers to their satisfaction. The management is pretty good, it is a easy job to do so I believe anyone can do it."
good,Working at Party City was fun and there was always something to do. I like to keep busy at work. The managers as well as my co-workers were all great i enjoyed working with everyone. At times around the busiest part of the season (halloween) it gets really busy and sometimes overwhelming but it keeps you on your feet and teaches you to be able to handle the craziest days at work.
good,"6hr work shift, dress up and assist customers. I learned that customers appreciate quality customer service. management was fair and very helpful, co-workers work as a great team, finding a good costume was the hardest about the job< but i really enjoyed dressing up, the customers and co-workers the most about the job"
good,"I've learned how to handle a register,help customers with what they need and to be part of a team. At work we usually update on items and the aisles for the holidays coming up and make sure we make the customer have a satisfying experience. Management is good and top of things and co-workers put there best effort into making the store neat,clean and keeping the customers happy. The hardest part of the job is yo be organized whne the store is the most busiest but the most enjoyable part is when helping a customer of any suggestions to throwing a party , you use your imagination and be creative."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy always setting up planograms and helping customers, its a very fast paced environment. I learn new things everyday im there like how to ask customer for their email and actually getting it ,how to set up grids ,new ways to set stuff up, and great ways to improve customer service. Manager are great they are always willing to help you improve and the harder you work the more they refer you to hire up. My co workers work very hard and always help when you need it,the hardest part of the job would be carrying heavy boxes up ladders.the most enjoyable part of my job is the people we help everyday."
good,"Fun and on going work place alot of business "
good,"A typical day at work was easy and well managed. I've learned that working with different people brings character. At times the management wasn't to good they had trouble agreeing, overall the employees did their job. The hardest part of the job was the customers, they can be rude. However the most enjoyable part of my job was working with people I grew to love. "
good,"I had a very good experience working at Halloween City. The people I worked with were always nice and easy to work with, I never had any problems with another employee. I enjoyed getting to work with people helping them find what they needed. From this job, I learned how to stay calm under the pressure of a busy shopping day. "
good,Greeting customers and stocking the products on the shelves. Halloween was always busy in the store.
good,"While working at Party City, I worked behind the balloon counter. Here, I learned customer service skills and how to deal with discrepancies. I also learned how to work as part of a team. Management was very nice and worked with my schedule. They also helped us to understand what we needed to get done and how to do it right. My co-workers were wonderful and fun people, who were always willing to help out when assistance was needed. The service at Party City, at the time that I was working there, was helpful and friendly. The hardest part about working here was learning to deal with rude or unhappy customers because they felt that they could take to you in an aggressive manner, but this is where you learn patience and how to deal with such events. During Halloween, the employees got to dress up in costume for the month of October and help customers. This was definitely the best part of working at Party City."
good,"This job was very simple as long as you understood the duties and maintain a hard work attitude.  That was me, i like to keep myself busy at all times, and Party City has allowed me to do that.  It's a party store that consistently needs restocking and i was given the opportunity to be in charge of taking care of one the 11 aisles placed in party city.  I learned various things at party city, i learned schematics, i learned order, i learned that working hard just makes work hard, but working smarter is always a better way of thinking when dealt with a situation at work.  Management has always been there for me, when i needed to confide to them they were always there. The relationship between co workers were great.  They have made it fun and exciting to be working at party city.  Hardest part of the job was during Halloween season, the amount of stress and pressure you go under because it is the busiest season of the year for party city.  the most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers and the management team.  "
good,"I enjoyed working at party city, had to be decorative and creative to create the fun environment they have a reputation for. "
good,"Management was not that great when I worked there, but I know things have improved since leaving."
good,There is always something different things to do so we are always productive. I work with great people and it is fun to go to work each day. 
good,One of my first jobs and it was seasonal. It overall was an okay experience but nothing i'd like to do again. Halloween is the best part then it pretty much gets very slow & boring. 
good,"Party City is a fun place to work, and provides great seasonal employment particularly around October because of Halloween."
good,Most of my days at work require customer service balloons and cash register. I also make sure every section is constently full with our product and enjoyable for customers to buy. I learn how to work well with customer and employee concerns. Sometimes the hardest part of my job is making sure customers enjoy the ideas we have for them with the type of parties they want to throw. I enjoy doing balloons and making sure i am always moving to make sure my day is always productive.
good,A typical day at work was quite fun. The environment was fun as well. The management was not bad at all. All of the managers were friendly and were there for you if you needed something. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to interact with customers and talk with the children that came in during the time. There was not a hard part of this job. The days went by smoothly.
good,"Fun, interactive place to work where I learned to better serve customers in a retail environment."
good,"clean up after kids run around and make a mess"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job, is the customers. They have come to know me on first name basis and I really enjoy putting a smile on their faces before they leave the store. A typical day involves me being the Lead cashier, answering questions to benefit both the shoppers, and the phone calls. Overall i definitely enjoy my management and the owners are also intensely involved. We strive for a Better atmosphere everyday. I do have a few complaints about one particular manager being lazy, and unable to provide that upbeat attitude and customer service. It makes my job a little more difficult but i enjoy the challenge. I enjoy most of the co-workers as they are hard working as i am. i few slack a bit, but that comes with their age as well. I have learned so many things working here. I have learned where i want my life to go from this point, as well as it has really made me a social butterfly so to speak. Before Party City, i didnt know much about retail, but i have since learned fundamental steps in how to run a business. "
good,"Helping customers, keeping store nice and always planning for next season plan-o."
good,I would walk into the store and help people right away. I learned how to merchandise and flex. The management was extremely nice and always willing to help. My co-workers were a blast to work with. I even met one of them and I ended up going to middle school together. The hardest part of the job was trying to find missing pieces to costumes that weren't in the right packages. The most enjoyable part was helping people.
good,An OK job for someone still in school or someone willing to put up with the constant changes in corporate policy.
good,duties and tasks varied on a dailly basis making it enjoyable. co workers were team players and overall a good time to see diiferent types of party favors.
good,Worked part time during the holidays. Management was understanding and if you needed a specific day off they would allow it. Met some awesome people while working there
good,I feel they hired more people then needed and wouldnt give many hours. The management was awesome and fun. I was always kept on my toes.
good,"* A typical day at work consists of lots of smiling customers and some occasional rude customers, nevertheless all customers left with the help they needed."
good,"It was fun, got to meet lots of different people and help them dress up for halloween"
good,"I'd open the store, get the cash registers ready for the day, make sure employees were ready and had what they needed for their shift, read emails, implement signage changes, and any other changes outlined in daily communications. After making sure products looked good on the shelves, I'd open the store. I would assist customers in creating Halloween costumes, and decorations. I would assist employees with product inquiries and store transfers. I would schedule breaks and lunches."
good,Easy job with a lot of customer service
good,"A typical day at work was being a cashier, stocking aisles and helping customers. I learned a lot about work ethic, management skills, and what I like in a job. My management team was amazing! They took care to make sure that you were okay and happy. They also made sure that you were on task and that you always had something to do. My co-workers were amazing as well. We all got along, there was very little drama and I still keep in touch with them. Definately my favorite place to work so far. The hardest part of the job was doing the exact same thing everyday. The most enjoyable part was Halloween! That is by far the busiest part of the year and the most fun!"
good,"Although I only worked here for the Halloween season, I would definitely work there again, 90% of my co-workers were nice and I became good friends with one of them. The managers are awesome and it is a fun place to work"
good,Party city was my first job. I was hired for part time. Then Halloween was getting close so they were hiring people for seasonal. I was cashier there as well. That's were i got all my Experience with being cashier. But then they got me confused with some of the people that were seasonal so they let me go. But i am thankful that it was my first job there and the experience was awesome.
good,"-A typical day at work consists of (early shift) starting at 7:00 am, and inflating balloon orders until we open the doors, as well as cleaning up front and finishing up anything the previous night crew did not accomplish."
good,"Balloon counter was always my favorite. Even though it was busy all the time, making arrangements for wedding and birthday parties was exciting. Seeing the look on peoples faces was priceless when they came to pick them up."
good,stuffing shelves. a part time job. how to deal with customers and how to help people with what they needed... learning how to deal with situations in a work place. computing and imputing merchandise
good,"the hardest part of this job was, we had to put up and broke down the whole entire store."
good,"I tended to customers' need, which included completing purchases, taking balloon orders, preparing these orders in between customers, and sometimes helping customers find particular items."
good,"I greeted customers, ran the cashier, assisted customers and cleaned up at the end of the day. The hardest part of the job would have to have been remembering to greet the customers and having to go up and down the ladder"
good,"A typical day at work was stocking, keeping the store tidy, and helping out customers. I learned how to set up a store, and stock items and make room for new items. My coworkers were very nice and all did their individual jobs but also lended a hand where help was needed."
good,This was an enteraining place to work but the best thing about this job was the discount on the clothes.
good,"Very busy around certain times of the year but its nice to work there. Management was very nice, laid back and fun!"
good,"The closer it got to halloween, the busier we were. I learned how to properly stock according to grids as well as work a cash register. Some skills I was able to improve on were: math, communication, assistance, and working with others. The managers were nice, friendly, and approachable. The hardest part of the job was cashiering. This was only because we constantly need the managers permission to work certain features on the cash registers. Cashiering was also the most enjoyable part of the job because I was able to interact with all customers and I enjoy math."
good,"*A typical day involves me checking my register, making sure I have the correct amount of $150 in my draw. Blowing up balloons, answering and providing knowledge to every customer. Cleaning my area and entire store after closing"
good,this was an excellent job great customers and cooltore to work at
good,"Working here was fun, here is where i was really taught workforce basics, i.e. customer service, working together. Management was good, the owners of the corporation were very pleasant and nice. co-workers were great, mostly everyone got along. the most enjoyable part of this job would have to be the customer-emplyee interaction and the employee-employee interaction."
good,"Morning stock there was hard at first, working from 5am to 9am, but it left me awake and more attentive the rest of the day. The highlight for me was working in building materials. It was a great work out and instead of smelling like sweat at the end of a shift, I smelled like pine....a worthy trade off."
good,"Party city is a very fun place to work, although there is alot of heavy lifting alot of people who go there. Its always busy so you have to be on your toes and quick."
good,Party City is a fun company to work for. The variety of things we sell for Parties/Holidays is unbelievable. There's never a dull moment
good,"Es una empresa que impulsan al colaborador a desarrollar de manera activa su creatividad, sin perder de vista al cliente que es prioridad"
good,"There are variety of stuffs in different aisles that customers demand. The place is big that cleaning up would take long to do yet understandable if knowing the place. There are chances that items, even small toy ones, will be on floor and organizer. So, it is a perfect job position to clean things up."
good,"I would walk in to work, go straight into the aisles to check if there was any loose items on the floor. After I was done with that I would unload the costumes from the back storage and give it to the customers."
good,"I had a decent time working at Party City, the management was almost a joke. The culture worker was very toxic, don‚Äôt get me wrong there was some few co-worker was great."
good,"I was only a seasonal employee, during Halloween, I've had better jobs that I liked more but it wasn't bad. Requires patience with customers. "
good,It was a very good experience working at party city. Great first time job. My position was seasonal and helping the customers find their Halloween costumes during that time was so much fun.
good,"working for party city had its ups and downs. the job itself was good, steady work, Aisle 1 is constantly changing with the current season/holiday so there is always new displays set every 2-3 months. if you work hard there is room for advancement. only problem i had while there was with upper management, the franchise i was with couldn't seem to keep a District manager longer than a couple months so the stores all suffered due to lack of competent leadership"
good,"This job is extremely flexible and is the perfect fit for those who already have a job but are also looking for a little something else. Everyone is super ""family like"" and friendly."
good,Really liked working here also. Party City the definition of retail. Fast paced and ever changing with non stop customer service action. There is a task for every type of worker in Party City.
good,"Fun,creative environment. Interesting Clientel. Cleaned,stocked, cashed out and provided customer service. Management is great. Comfortable work space"
good,I met a lot of cool people and I got to work with children to help them find their Halloween costumes. I also got to meet a lot of people looking for decorations for their houses
good,"Off season (not Halloween season) is very relaxed and laid back. During Halloween season, it is very fast paced and hectic. High volume of customers and product knowledge is very useful."
good,"High paced, fun place to work. It‚Äôs a party store, so you have to be willing to listen well to what people are looking for when they come In. Anything you need for a party it‚Äôs there!"
good,"It was fun to work there , but mostly about hard word and keeping our costumers happy , i was also taught how to blow up all types of balloons.it was fun working as a team but it got a little messy after a while"
good,My year at Party City was beneficial to my retail ability. I learned that everywhere you go you will meet different people that need different assistance.
good,"Started this job at 16, was my first job so I wasn‚Äôt expecting a large inflow of money, but it kept money in my pocket through high school so I was satisfied."
good,"A commonplace day at work would typically consist of taking over for a fellow cashier, assuming control of all the responsibilities of the front end, and making sure to clean up toward the end of a shift. Usual day to day front end tasking would be folding or inflating balloons, tendering transactions, damaging or repackaging goods, et cetera. The most satisfying aspect of working at Party City is bringing joy to customers by helping them find specifically what they are looking for or resolving problems with suitable alternatives. Management is fair, impartial and will always seek to address any conflicts or scheduling problems, to a reasonable extent."
good,A good starter job for people out of highschool.  It‚Äôs good environment just don‚Äôt get many hours so it kind of sucks . I think party city is fun job.
good,Enjoyable place to work. Stressful amounts of work but fun environment. Disorganized and lacking communication.  No leave from Sept to Nov. Holidays off
good,I love working there but you don‚Äôt get much hours unless it‚Äôs halloween. Very fasted paced. Always something new in the store because of each season. Just wish it payed more and gave more hours other then that it‚Äôs an amazing place to work!!!
good,It was a seasonal job. I worked during halloween so it was busy around that time. It was very fast paced and it would get so unorganized because there would be many people coming in and out.
good,This was a fast paced seasonal job. I would recommend this type of temp job for certain people who are prepared to learn a lot in a small amount of time.
good,It got really busy during the weekends so it was really fast paced. Sometimes I would even stay overtime to help. It was important for us to communicate with each other to keep up with what was going on around the store.
good,"This was my first job in high school. I started off above minimum wage and the managers gave me every opportunity to advance and be promoted. Unfortunately, I was too young to be promoted despite being well overqualified for said position."
good,"You learn new things through the day."
good,"great place-pay and hours aren't the greatest"
good,"I worked for the Halloween season. Stressful, messy, confusion is easy to come by, management is regularly called, but we got to wear costumes. Basically an unavoidable mess during the Halloween season."
good,"Job was fantastic and management was very polite. Very kind and welcoming, throwing holiday parties and giving bonus' to all employees. The pay just isn't enough."
good,Receiving was a really good and easy job i was in the back of the house checking in merchandise and stocking the floor on my own nobody to get in the way and i was capable of getting my job done without any interruptions
good,As far as cashier jobs go I would rate it pretty highly since the staff was friendly. If there are no upcoming holidays its really empty otherwise its really busy.
good,"The day would start with checking the job duty sheet to figure out what you will be doing for your shift and then you get to it. You learn how to do cash and basic cleaning and housekeeping, stocking shelves. It was a fun place to work and it is relaxed, management is nice and easy to work with"
good,I liked working at Party City mostly because you never knew what was going to happen that day. Each day brought a new challenge for me and my co-workers whether that meant with customers or coworkers we rose to the occasion together.
good,"Great working environment, but the pay is not well"
good,"Very easy comfortable work place. Balanced and flexible schedule, friendly managers. Overall a pleasant experience for my first job. Feel like it gave me the push I needed to become successful."
good,"it was a seasonal position. Like working at target, I did not let the manager know I had special needs and had so much pressure working with customers that my hearing loss became a problem ."
good,Holloween City is a fun place to work for a second job to gain a little extra spending money for Christmas. It has a laid back environment that can be a little hectic at times as it gets closure to Halloween. The schedule was very flexible and the manager was more than happy to work around my other work/life schedule. The only downside was that it was minimum wage and that they are only open for about 8 weeks out of the year.
good,Reason why party city was a good place for me to work at was because they had early shifts that started from 4 am and that was a good thing for me so I can have another Job at night.
good,it was fun and excited always seeing new costumes coming into the store or having people give you new ideas. the least exciting part of working here were just the lack of supervisors vision/ when needed help.
good,You don't get any benefits and they pay could be better since you don't get many hours.at first it's slow but as halloween gets closer it gets busy and nights get longer
good,Party city was a fun place to work. The general managers were overly controlling. I learned how to blow up balloons with a helium machine and how to work a register.
good,"Great job for any student lots of hours in the Halloween season would be working the cash, putting out stock, helping with balloon orders or cleaning the store"
good,"Party City is a great starting job. They will work around your schedule to give you hours. Management and staff are extremely friendly. It a very simple place to work and only difficult around seasonal time. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job is working with customers. A good customer can make or break your experience here. Though it rarely happens. You can get some unruly customers from time to time. But minus those rare occasions most of the time customers are respectful and thankful for your help. This is a great place to start working if you are looking for something like a second job, or a part-time as it is not stressful or labor intensive."
good,"A typical day during the Halloween season was busy and crowded. Lots of people in need of costumes and accessories. Coming in, you clock in and jump into action getting to your area and either helping those at the costume wall or working an aisle. If you are at ""the wall"" you must be loud spoken, keeping everyone calm and orderly, taking order numbers and checking the availability of costumes and sizes before sending them to pick up their orders. If working in an aisle you must keep that aisle clean and organized. Doing go backs to keep products in their place. As well as helping customers find what they need to make their costumes complete. Depending on who is working you will have a different experience, it can be a fun and energetic time or a stressful and difficult time. Some managers are helpful and great teachers, while others push their weight around and use their superiority to be demeaning and demanding. Most of the employees were helpful and easy to work with, working as a team to get things done. The hardest part of the job is having patience. There are a lot of challenges that come with working in a busy and crowded store, patience and focus are key to managing the stress of it all.  The best part of the job is being able to help people find what they need or being able to help other employees to ensure a customer is satisfied. I learned a lot about managing time, having patience, memorizing products and their placement, and how to work in a busy environment, keeping everything calm and orderly."
good,"All of my coworkers were fun to be around starting with the other sales associates all the way up to the store manager. They kept the focus on the customers but gave us time to get to know each other. I was a cashier but learned where the products were located in the stores so that I could help point the customers in the correct direction. If I didn't know where to find a certain product or how to answer a question from a customer, my co-workers were always there to help answer my questions."
good,"Fun place to work at, specially for seasonal in Halloween. You get to know a lot of people, plus its a great place for someone to start in retail. They trained you real good."
good,"Working at party city was such a great experience, understanding how a store works so smoothly while under stress is a great experience to have. Learning how to function and keep calm while being assigned multiple tasks is a big skill needed for Party City and a great skill to have."
good,It was a good job but the one manager takes things out in the employees when she is in a bad mood which I think isn't fair and some people bring there own problems to work when they shouldn't there is alot of drama there
good,My typical day consisted of me walking through the store when i come in to greet the customers and helping them with costumes around the store. I also checked inventory and communicated with my other managers.
good,I worked for a Party City franchise that consisted of 11 stores run by the franchise owner. It was a very faced paced job and there was always something new to learn. I was extremely happy with my location and position but the pay was not competitive and there was not room for advancement since it was not a corporate position. I was very happy with the environment as well as the company mission.
good,"worked there for about two and a half months and was a very fun environment to say the least. all my coworkers were very fun to work with. If i hadn't worked seasonal i would've loved to stay, but not for the pay of minimum."
good,Enjoyed working their as a seasonal sales associate even though the pay is not great. Very entertaining with the different aspects of work you can do at the job.
good,"A typical day at work was always busy with either managing the front area of the store with customers, or helping set up merchandise. "
good,i enjoyed working at Halloween city a lot showing around customers are to different out fits they can put together the pay was pretty low though but all the managers were awesome people
good,"Party city is a great place to work at for some who loves to help customers shop and create something amazing for their parties , friendly staff and always strive for the best"
good,"A typical day at work would is you walk in, put your stuff in a locker in the back rooms. Get clocked on. Find out what register is yours, log into it. Then help out customers if your not on main register because if you are then you must remain up front. I learned how to use a register with this job. The management is ok I wouldn't give it 5 stars. Workplace culture I have no problem with. The hardest part would be closing. The most enjoyable is helping the customers and making sure they leave with a smile on their face."
good,Good job to have if your are balancing school and home life. Work environment is great but hours are very limited and that stops anyone from making a living. Also the associates are limited to what they can do on the registers and that keeps the line from moving and inconvenient for everyone. Especially when the cashiers get the backlash of it.
good,Working at this corporation helped me build my customer service skills and my work ethics . And getting familiar with being a sales associate and getting familiar with The work environment.
good,"This was my first job, and I learned how very quickly! I was hired as a seasonal employee working during the Halloween month. It was very busy and that was good. I got my experience on a cash register, stocking, and working with the public."
good,"The typical day at party city was never ending. Wether it was helping a customer with balloons, or a costume, there was never down time. There were two managers, they were okay, but they were serious about getting the job done and doing it right. The workplace itself was always clean and other co-workers were friendly and supportive. The hardest part of the job was some of it was very demanding but the most enjoyable was seeing kids faces with their halloween costumes <3"
good,"I worked part time during the seasonal halloween season. Really fun, easy, help people pick out costumes or stock the back. Manager was easy going and friendly."
good,I was a stocker they seen great work so the promoted me to Cashier and then I moved up to a stock supervisor and I ran my own team we did a lot of unloading products and did good
good,it was rewarding to watch the transformation from an open space into a complete store and then back to an empty space in a matter of weeks. management was a little inexperienced and quit before the end of the season.
good,its a cool environment to work in. everything was okay but the first manager was wack. Coworkers were cool too. Second manager was cool as well. Customers were either cool or wack but mostly cool.
good,Worked seasonal around Halloween. They would call back a number i would have to pick stock and make sure it was the correct costume the customer wanted
good,For my first experience working at Party City was a friendly environment. The managers treated me with respect. The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting the customers and stocking.
good,"Halloween city is a nice place to work they make u feel welcome, they also make it seen pretty fun and easy when u are helping the kids find something.its a GREAT place to work."
good,I enjoy the people I work with and the work is not very hard. I am looking for something else because I need a full time job with benefits if possible.
good,"I learned many customer service skills, multitasking, time management, and other key responsibilities. The hardest part was working halloween but if you really listen to your managers and voice any concerns it will be easy to get through it in one piece."
good,Great people and great working environment. Always had fun working here. Learned a lot about sales and customer service. Never had any problems with other associates or management. Experience
good,"Though, I was only there a short time, the co-workers there and the managers seemed very nice and helpful. I have a disability and they made sure I knew what I was doing before sending me on my own."
good,Party City was a great establishment. I enjoyed my co-workers and the management was great they also worked around my school schedule. The only thing I did not like was the lack of hours I was getting.
good,"Not a bad company to work for overall, but as with most places, location is key. Better general management training would benefit the company as a whole to make all locations fun to work at."
good,Very fast paced work environment with a wide range of options to learn and grow internally. A typical day will be supporting the 800+ corporate and franchise locations.
good,Good for getting into the workplace with seasonal work and retail experience. Culture is fun and the team is very connected. Great casual and fun job to boost a resume with no other experience.
good,"I enjoy working there because of the personalities, no issues when it comes to the work environment. The issues I have with party city are slim to none. The pay is not much and there aren‚Äôt any benefits. I do like how they handle the environment based on the organization and cleanliness."
good,I didn't make much because i was one on 5 people they hired to help that halloween season. But while i was there i enjoyed myself and ultimately had a good work experience.
good,A typical day at word would be helping the customers with whatever they needed and answering phone calls and always assisting anyone who needed the help.
good,A typical fay at work would consist of helping out customers and picking things up off the ground. It was well managed with great managers that treated everyone fairly. The hardest part of the job was putting out freight and moving it around.
good,It can be stressful if your not good at managing multiple task at once. A fun environment though being around all different kinds of people and engaging in helping with Halloween needs.
good,"It is an easy job, not a lot of customers come in the store and there is not a lot to clean up. Most of the job is just pushing stock and talking to your coworkers."
good,"Go into it not expecting much and you wont be disappointed. Easy ""interview"" process and if you love Halloween its a cool job. Better to work there if you already have experience in retail since the training is relatively minimal. If you want some extra cash and an employee discount its a great temp job."
good,I liked working for them due to flexibility with hours. I like that  always busy working on something. Management is great and provides support and feedback.
good,"Met many fun people, had a flexible schedule and good managers. Loved being able to get a lot of hours and having a pretty easy going workplace. Definitely would recommend"
good,"i enjoyed my time and experience at Party city. coworkers were nice and got along great, schedule was flexible. The management were super professional and understanding when needed. During holidays it got pretty crazy but always had backup."
good,Short hours/temporary job. Staff very friendly. Fun to entertain customers. Dress up in different costumes. Help the kids find the characters they like.
good,"Excelente, muy bueno el ambiente laboral, muy bueno"
good,The job was a normally always in between quiet or busy.It showed me a lot on how to deal with people in a professional sense such as how separate business and emotion.The co-workers that worked with created a great comfortable work environment.The job had good times the most enjoyable part was the satisfaction of customers
good,"Party city was an amazing place to work. "
good,The lead manager was never really there and it made things difficult around the workplace. Most of the staff always tried to take com and when it wasn't there place witch made things even worse.
good,Party City is a great a place of employment. The environment is an exciting place to work. I enjoyed working as a receiver. My daily tasks made the shift go by quickly.
good,"A typical day at work was always easy except around Halloween, our busy season."
good,"good slow faced job typical day is slow manger are ok, halloween is crazy busy and everything is rushed but over all a good easy going job that pays average."
good,"I loved working here. The job wasn't hard, and the coworkers were all friendly. Helping people find there costumes was always a fun experience. I would recommend any high school teens for this position."
good,I became a front and supervisor the employees are very friendly Management could be a little better overall the best party city is in Branford Connecticut
good,"working at party city is a fun work environment and the people you work with are fun and friendly as well we are like family."
good,It's a fun place to work during the holiday but some days can be tougher then others if you let them but in all it's a very great job to work at especially during the holidays
good,I have been working there for over a year and I really enjoy working there. I like the flexible hours and working around the holidays. my co-workers are really nice and so are my managers.
good,"‚Ä¢	Helped incoming callers via phone  "
good,You will be able to help people as well as feel each holiday as it comes and passes by. This is a good job to experience it will help you to learn how to multi task and attend to each person's specific need.
good,"Greeting customers, coralling carts that have been left in aisles, picking up items that have been dropped and putting them in the gobacks bin, helping customers find or reach an item, restock shelves, organize and put back gobacks and clean the sales floor."
good,"I worked at Party City during one of the busiest times of the year and i can honestly say i enjoyed myself. I enjoy an work environment that is continuously busy and has me working. I learned many things about excellent customer service and not being afraid to interact with a customer. The hardest part of the job was witnessing the robberies that took place, because it was the busiest time of the year. The most enjoyable part was being able to interact with customers as far as helping picking Halloween costumes, finding merchandise and much more."
good,The staff were always fun and a blast to work with. The managers were very understanding of school life and everything else. The break room was a little stuffed and so forth but everything else was very average.
good,Party city managers are all about making the work place a professional work place at all times. They are good leader. Wish I could have worked there longer
good,"It was a fun place to work. The customers were fun. Never a boring day on the job. Hardest thing about the ob was standing on your feet for X amount of hours, other than that everything was great."
good,Come to work ready and on time everyday. I work during the seasonal holidays and I definitely look forward to the change of decorations for each holiday season. I like working with a team also
good,I enjoy working as General Manager and Interim Market Manager for Halloween City but for six years they have been promising a year round position to both me and my supervisor but at the end of the year they no longer have that opening because the funding from the company is not there.
good,"Working at party city was a fun experience, it was my first job and everyone was so welcoming and nice. Unfortunately it was seasonal and I couldn't stay, I enjoyed working there."
good,"I was a Seasonal worker."
good,It was fun an alot of people was very nice very good environment have pizza parties sometimes the security is very good they always keep their bathroom clean
good,"A typical day at work involves a lot of customer service and operating the cash register. You can learn how to keep Inventory, stock shelves, various customer service skills, and how to operate basic retail technology."
good,"Typically slow on any days that doesn't fall within a busy season (Summers/Following the ends of Halloween)"
good,"i only worked in this establishment for 2 weeks, the position was seasonal. I did enjoy going to work and being at work. my co- workers were nice, I really liked the interaction with the customers. I did have to stay late at times but I did not mind this at all because I was not the only one staying late."
good,"Job is very easy and can be fast paced on very busy days. Audits performed every six months for determining raises, but hours not very secure. Halloween is the peak."
good,"Started as a temporary Halloween expert which was a difficult job, very fast paced, and had to deal with difficult situations on a consistent basis with little breaks. Good job for getting reputable experience in customer service."
good,I LOVED working here. Halloween season was a little hectic but the experience taught me how to work in a more fast paced environment.
good,great store and good people and had a great time working there and also getting the work done. love seeing the people happy when they buy an item
good,"A typical day at work is blowing up balloons, cleaning the store, cleaning the front, trying to satisfy customers while following company policies and having some fun."
good,"Nothing bad about this place, People were nice, Nothing hard about the job. Just stocked shelves and helped people on the floor (customer service). Had to go really high on the ladders though, felt kinda unsafe but was necessary to reach the shelves even on the biggest ladder they had."
good,"It depends if I was on cash my day could other be good or great which for me was just fine. I love to interact with the customers and to ask them if they found everything ok or if they had help looking for what they needed. I wanted to make sure they had a good experince while at our store."
good,"A typical day working at Halloween City is constantly picking up trash from the floor, cleaning, directing costumers into specific locations of merchandise, and putting up costumes where they need to be. I learned how to multi task, work at a very fast pace, how to handle the dressing rooms, and good costumer service skills. The management was successful, we usually had the main manager and two other managers working all the time due to how busy the store would be. My co-workers were all helpful, and positive, fun people to work with! The hardest part of the job was trying to get the entire store cleaned by a specific time. The most enjoyable part of the job was successfully helping costumers find the exact items that they needed."
good,"It's a fun place to work as a college student part-time. Unless you are a manager you make little money. Must be accompanied by a second and third job. The team I work with is pretty awesome. You have to be great at customer service, and there is a lot of lifting. Must be able to adjust to changing holiday seasons often. The best part of the job is seeing customers faces when they've looked everywhere for something and come into our store and find it. The hardest part is it's so fun to work there but unless you're a Team lead or a manager you eventually will have to leave and find a better paying job. There was not a lot of gossiping and you become real close with the people you work with. I have a hard time with the fact that they will give me a position title but not give me any benefits with it. Then they would take it away. Like I ended with a Manager title but did not get full time hours or better pay. So technically they just gave me more responsibilities without supplementing it."
good,"Probably my favorite job thus far. Because it was tailored for one of the most entertaining holidays of the year, you get to work around a lot of fun products and meet so many fascinating people."
good,yep another fun atmosphere however the pay scale is not good at least it wasn't for me. you will work your tail off but i guess if retail is your thing its good.
good,"Working for the company as a Cashier is cool. I work for a franchise and not a corporate store so there is much more freedom. I have a manger that works around my schedule. Opportunity for advancement is slim to none. You make minimum wage and youre supposed to get a raise every year but it comes out of the managers bonus so its rare to actually receive it. Not a bad starter job, not something to live and pay bills off of."
good,good workplace. decent pay. hours varied but can be stable if your willing to work. dull moments off season but fast pace during season.
good,It has been a great experience working at Party City. I feel that I have grown and become better able to use the skills that I have further developed to enhance any company that I may work for.   I have gained a better ability to create profit and manage costs and product ratios.
good,Management is easy going but they can make your job stressful. They ask too much from you and don't follow up with days requested off or get called in alt if others call out. Sometimes you don't get enough hours.
good,"Working at Halloween City/USA has always been a fun experience  for me. Halloween City has always been a second job, and as long as you meet the everyday requirements of the job, room for advancement is optional. If growing through this company is not what is right for you, there is always great employee recognition programs such as employee of the week, where you are awarded with a certificate and some kind of gift card of sorts. Each year working for the company, I have been recognized for my work; organization, cleanliness, going above and beyond, outstanding customer service. The best part about working for Halloween City is you get to look at Halloween decorations and costumes all day, help guests find their Halloween theme for the year, and help to set up displays"
good,"The typical day includes working freight, providing quality customer service, and janitorial duties such as: sweeping, taking out the trash, cleaning the bathrooms, and occasional vacuuming. I've learned how to provide the quality customer service, work freight quickly and efficiently, how to train a new employee, and how set planograms. Though I don't always agree with how management decides to do things, I always do as I'm told and if I think of a better idea, I'll pitch that to them in private. I love all of my co-workers because each individual has a different set of skills to bring to the job and different personalities that make party city a wonderful environment. The hardest part of the job is that it's so fast-paced on holidays, so if I'm sick, keeping up can be challenge. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I accomplish difficult tasks, such as working a lot of frieght in a short amount of time or helping a customer find what they are looking for even if we don't have that specific item (i.e. a costume that they wanted and instead, finding parts from a bunch of different costumes that work to make something better)."
good,"Party City was a great employer for the month I was there, and I would have enjoyed working with them more, but after the Halloween season was over they chose not to extend my temp contract. Too bad."
good,i learned how to cashier there.that was one of my first jobs i had and i loved working there the offered me to stay an i did for while but they didnt give me alot of hours
good,"a good seasonal job that i gained manager experience in. Learned how to schedule people, and pay them in retail.net. Loved working with my employees to make the store a better store."
good,"Most days I would either put away freight of products away, or be main cashier. I would work the balloon counter, to fill balloon orders. During Halloween would help customers pick out their costumes or pick out decorations for parties or their house."
good,"Fun place to start working, and gain plenty of customer service experience. As a part of management expect to be busy 95% of the time.  It is a highly productive environment in which the store constantly changes throughout the season therefore always giving you something to do.  Depending on your team you can learn alot from working here as a part of management or you can learn very little."
good,its a good place to work to start in retail.but benefits and raises are not good. but i love my job i love dealing with people
good,Working a party city is a lot of fun. I especially like to do the balloon orders on Saturday mornings. It makes the time go by faster and it makes me happy knowing that I can make peoples parties a little more exciting!
good,There was always work to do. It was fun and full of excitement.
good,"Great overall company, however they expect you to do way more work than you're supposed to and not compensate you for any of it. There is almost no room for advancement and they prefer to hire new employees than promote."
good,"A regular day was me running around and multi-tasking to the best of my abilities. Management would actually let you do any job within the store that you felt you were up to. My co-workers always kept a smile on my face. I really enjoyed them always telling me their dreams of what they really wanted to do in life. The hardest part was trying to get a permanent position within the company, they mostly only hired seasonal workers. The most enjoyable part was my working environment. my co-workers and customers were great to be around. I learned that no job/career is worth holding onto if you're not happy being there."
good,"A fun filled place to work, great coworkers. Was promoted quickly"
good,Loved the work environment and the staff was great! Helping people party plan their event was for filling.
good,"during the busy times of the year there is much to do, like cleaning isles and restock also lots of customer service."
good,It was a very fun place to work. Great for a first job of something during college.
good,Typical shift is 8 hours. clock in and find a task to complete or help a customer. I learned a few manager skills. management was fun yet stern co-workers were easy to get along with. Nothing about this job was difficult. most enjoyable aspect was helping customers.
good,A typical day at work would require blowing up balloons or helping the customers find something in the store.  I learned that people are always in need of looking for party supplies especially in the summer.  The hardest part of this job I'd say was just stocking not that it was hard just time consuming.  The most enjoyable part of the job was blowing up the balloons. 
good,"A typical day at work for me is usually running cash and balloons. So when I am not busy helping someone at cash, most of the time I am blowing up balloons. When I'm not doing either, I am always filling, cleaning, facing, keeping the store looking presentable. I have learned more about multitasking than I ever would if I never had this job. It seems like it would be super easy to work there, but behind the scenes, it is intense. Management and coworkers are always there to support you. I always have at least one person in management working with me. The hardest part of the job is probably when it's extremely busy and sometimes being understaffed.. and the hours. The most enjoyable part is watching how happy the customers get when they realize that we have the product they need. You can't plan a party in a bad mood - so you can't go wrong :)"
good,"Typical day consisted of stocking shelves, selling merchandise, stocking back room, cleaning storefront and back room."
good,"A typical day at work includes working with customers to help them make their perfect costumes for Halloween. We worked with customers to fulfill all of their halloween needs. I also worked on the retail inventory after each shift. Management was not terrible, but it was difficult when a problem came up to get ahold of our manager. Co-workers were alright to deal with, but some didn't put in much effort so I did most of the work. The hardest part of the job was inventory because the entire store was always a mess. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customers enthusiasm and excitement when their costumes come to life!"
good,"Work usually starts with us organizing the products, bringing in shipments, and pricing the items."
good,I enjoy the customers that come in and look at Merchandise. The employees are nice and outgoing.
good,Party City is a fun job. I loved helping people plan events and suggesting items and activites. Everyday was different!
good,"I work either 8-6 or 10-9. The most enjoyable part of my job is taking care of my customers, helping them plan functions. I also love the fast pace. I handle cash, make the schedule for hourly employees, place orders for the store. I train my employees to deliver excellent customer service and to maintain a clean and clutter free environment."
good,"Constant customers to help and focus on, it is always a place to learn something new either from an existing customer or a new way to better do a task. Co-workers there are great to work with you could not ask for better people. I guess the hardest part of the day is when you find out what you are going to do the next day and there is no time to start on it. I would also have to admit that the most enjoyable part of the job is that a customer thanks you for having a great shopping experience."
good,Party City is a great company. I have been with them for nearly four years and in retail for over 15 years. I am trying to further my career in a non-retail environment.
good,"Working days included hard work, and long hours. I've learned how to multitask more each day. My coworkers and management were really nice and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers and that on a scale from one to 10 would only be a 3 because most customers were really nice. The one thing i can say that was really enjoyable about the job was being able to help customers with their choices."
good,"This job was a great first employment experience. I would stock merchandise, organize merchandise and train employees. Very low expectations which were easy to meet."
good,Was a good job if looking to work directly with customers and fast paced during holidays. Liked working as a team and helping with party selections and holidays.
good,"I worked at party city to have as a part time job. I was planning to go to University so I knew this job wasn‚Äôt my end goal, but it was good experience to have.  I became more comfortable talking to strangers as well as talking to my fellow coworkers."
good,It was my first job so I didnt really know how work culture should be but PC was actually decent. The people who worked there definently cared about advancement and making sure the job is done. Good for high schoolers.
good,"The boss and co workers got along with each other. If you were doing your work, you didn't have anything to worry about. It felt great to help customers."
good,"good starter job, management isn‚Äôt that great. Was left without a general manager for 2-3 months. District managers aren‚Äôt as helpful as could be. The pay isn‚Äôt as good until you‚Äôve been promoted which took me a year to work for. Associates definitely helped my time there more enjoyable."
good,"I worked at Halloween City opposed to actual party city. The position functioned as a crash course in working retail. Since it was a pop up store,  I was able to gain experiance in store set up and take down, as well as the standeard experiance of day to day operations. The pay wasnt great, but i gained a lot of good experiance working their."
good,"Party City of Rome has the best environment to work in, everyone feels welcome and like they belong there. The managers go out of their way to make sure the customers and the employees are having a great experience. Everyone feels included and treat each other like family. I can only hope to find another job with this amazing environment!"
good,The store was a seasonal store that sold Halloween costumes. While i was working there i worked the floor and helped families to find the costumes or costume pieces that the were looking for. It was very fun.
good,"Had fun, got some fun memories and plenty of ideas for future costumes. Enjoyed working this seasonal job. Got to set up props and had fun decorating the store."
good,"My most recent manager was very kind and considerate how ever not all of them are and were like that , other co workers were friendly .But I got To say the boss for my manager made a big issue of me not wearing uniform when I was pregnant which I felt it was rude.Forcing me to buy maternity cloths just for a part time (5 hrs) job seemed like the company had no consideration at all ,also expected every worker to wear uniform regardless of part time or ful time"
good,"Lots of change over the last two years, All geared to enhance customer in store experience, The amount of changes over the last two years was a major source of stress."
good,I worked at party city for a few months. It was very fun! I started working during the Halloween season. I worked as a sales person and cashier. My favorite part was you got to Interact with people
good,"Fast paced environment, always something to do. Great people to work for. Extra shifts often available. Always willing to teach you about the different positions within the company. Flexible and fun!"
good,"It‚Äôs a good job for starting out. Fun & friendly environment and people. Somedays we‚Äôre better than others. However, it was a fun place to work and to have been apart of."
good,"When halloween comes around Party city is the Best . One day My co worker was walking pass Ale 3 && a little boy as a customer had on a mask and scared my co worker. Managers was nice and fair , also work place the most enjoyable part seeing the kids pic out treats , toys and very excited jumping up && down . very happy"
good,working there can be stressful for someone who just started the job and had no previous experience. the hardest part would be how fast your able to check a customer out and fill their balloon orders.
good,"Management was good"
good,"First job, people were great normal customer service job helped people stocked shelves and blew up balloons. Great management very understanding and helpful"
good,"Fast pace work environment. Either ringing, unloading trucks, scanning outs. Helping customers. Balloons balloons balloons. When you have the right team and hours it can be done."
good,A typical day includes taking care of customers and making sure balloon orders are fulfilled. I learned many things about how a retail industry works as far as seasonal changes. It helps when there is a great management team too!
good,"Although it was seasonal, it was a new learning experience working there. Being fast-paced, always busy, it really gets you out of your shell as an individual."
good,A typical day at Party City was fun but knowledgeable at the same time. The managers at Party City could see when an employee would do better in another area then just cashier and cleaning. When they saw a hard worker the would take them to train them in harder areas to challenge them. The work place was very relaxed we did have moments of stress to complete a project on time or when something was done wrong but it was never like that all the time. The managers would guide and calm down situations when customers were not happy with the services provided and created a teaching moment to the staff. The hardest part of the job was the random scheduling you never knew what you were working until the schedule came out but that was expected.
good,"Great family operated business. I had job security, loyal and honest employers. I worked there for six years. The hardest part of the job was trying to please every customer, which wasn't hard but everyone's different so it could be changeling .  a typical day was placing orders on everyday merchandise to keep the store stocked. The best part of my day was helping customers to decorate and plan ."
good,"It is mainly a part time work place unless you are a manager and I really only get to work 4 days out of each week, but during the Halloween season gou get a lot more hours, other than that you wouldn't get very much. I liked the flexible schedules and working with my coworkers made everything smooth and fun."
good,Nice temporary seasonal part time job for those looking for a nice seasonal job to work during the fall months. Great for beginners to the working class.
good,"I liked the job the first 5 months new my daily routine never had any issues with anyone. 3rd gm came along, he was abrupt  when he would tell you something, changed my whole routine, didnt like me on any ladders to stock shelves eventually came out with i was too old even though i knew i ran circles around the teenagers and never called out without a doctors note."
good,"Fun work enviroment especially before the holidays, great employee discount, able to work a flexible schedule , good working conditions inside the store."
good,Just be ready for Halloween time which gets extremely busy and crazy. The rest of the year is pretty easy. Schedules change every week and are pretty flexable.
good,great for a second job really fun place i had the best associates everybody was cool. i miss working there because there never in the same spot each year. need extra cash work here.
good,"This job was very busy, not enough cashiers but very fun and polite customers , long hours on your feet very loving crew , helping customers was my all time favorite."
good,Overall I thought working at Party City was a great place I've never had a problem with any workers or management and got along with everyone and everything went smoothly most days
good,"Throughout my time there, I experienced very few times where there was nothing to do. You're always doing something if you don't have a line at the register. For the most part the employees and managers were tolerable to work with."
good,"While it suffers from low pay, long hours, disorganization and little benefits - so does pretty much all retail. Other than that it's a fun, active, engaging environment that makes me smile and not hate going to work in spite of itself. Customers are usually in a good mood (they are shopping for party supplies after all), completing balloon orders can actually be enjoyable, and high impact busy weekends are balanced by calm and laid back weekdays so it doesn't feel relentlessly stressful. No job is perfect, but when it comes to retail, I have heard tales of MUCH WORSE and honestly would highly recommend Party City to anyone who needs a part-time job."
good,"this was a typical but laid back retail environment. Management were very laid back, rarely was stressful, and decent first work experience as a teenager."
good,Was a pleasant working experience with excellent management and work environment. The only downfalls are the lack of hours available and the limited time period of the positions.
good,Great part time job. You wont make much money working their hours are very low. I worked for only 25 hours a week. Its a great place to work if your still in high school or just graduated from school.
good,"Great to work during halloween time. always busy and fast paced. Simple and great introduction into retail and plenty of jobs to learn and master, I would work here again."
good,Party city is a great store to work in its a bunch of colors and etc it‚Äôs make you feel warm and happy. Party city has every thing you need for parties it also my favorite store to shop for my kids party
good,"The company is friendly and very close knit only thing bad about the job is pay honestly. The work is easy, the customers are fun and everyday you usually get to put a smile on everyone's face!"
good,"If you're in HS or College and just need a job to make a little bit of cash and enjoy your time, this job is great for you! From July-November you are in full Halloween prep mode and everyone has a blast. If you're hired on after Halloween, it will not be as busy, but you still have a good time. Do not expect to make a lot of money working here, though."
good,Party city is a good place to work if you don't have much time due to flexible. Also as a first job or a student but advancement is limited. could also sever as a second job for extra income if you have the time
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time at party city, although the schedule was funky, the managers are always willing to work with you on anything. The work environment can be quick paced or slow depending on holidays and events."
good,It was a great experience. I just wish it was a longer term to work. The actual job was fun and uplifting. There was never a dull moment because it was their busy season.
good,"Fun stores to work in. Great atmosphere and customer.  Blowing up balloons gets a little annoying, but worth it because it is one of the rare retailers that doesn't do a big Christmas season, so you can see your family around the holidays."
good,"Helps employees gain visibility through [task]"
good,Managers should set more rules when it comes to the costumers during Halloween time. Needs to some form of establishment to help everyone around there
good,"A great job for someone looking for a steady variety of work in a fun environment."
good,"Would always have so many things to do from stocking, greeting customers, cart runs, providing customers with different costumes and sizes that they needed. It was always busy so it never was boring or slow. People seemed to always be in a good mood."
good,I personally love party city it feels like were all a family the work environment was very nice it was clean we also we also used a very nice technique called scan and bag it makes the line move quickly and swiftly
good,"Working at Party City is fast paced but very fun, especially in October. For every holiday the employees need to completely rearrange & redecorate the store, which can be tedious, but with the right attitude, it can be fun."
good,"Worked during the Halloween rush, so the days would fly by. The work could get physically intensive, due to sheer amount of customers. Overall, it was alright. Good entry level job for high school students."
good,"I enjoy working at Party City, however, it does require one to be a jack of all trades and to learn quickly. It is also very physically demanding so not entirely suited for those who have issues moving or cannot climb ladders."
good,"I worked part-time for about a month at party city Halloween seasonal location. I learned a lot of useful skills and things about working retail; such as customer service skills, cash handling and debit and credit machines."
good,"Although i worked in one of the busiest stores which could be a bit stressful at super busy times, it was still slower paced and enjoyable. Probably the easiest job i will ever work."
good,"-Fast paced job. "
good,"I actually enjoyed working here. Everyone was very nice, managers and co-workers. I worked during Halloween season so it was very fast paced and at times stressful but everything always ran smoothly and it was very easy to get help from a manager if needed without feeling pressured or like you're taking up their time."
good,"Halloween is the busiest time of the year here. It can be fun, but hectic and a little disorganized. Overall it was an enjoyable job but the pay is not there."
good,When I first started I noticed they were really welcoming and helping me out so much. Some people were very nice and helpful. The one thing that bothered me was them not being organized. Other than that everything was good.
good,"Party City is a fun and exciting environment dealing with customers, especially the kids. While working at Party City, I've learned their inventory procedures, how to deal with the lows and outs of the merchandise."
good,i worked the crazy halloween schedules and it was brutal but fun. once thats over the rest of the year is smooth sailing. if you work hard theres alot of  advancement opportunities.
good,"Party City is good, if you're looking for part-time employment. The environment is very fast paced on the weekend, especially the balloon counter. You have to be able to move fast and multi task. Management is cool and usually helps with the work load."
good,"During Halloween season, Party City is a very fun place to work. It is fast paced and you get to work with great people. You don't really need any experience."
good,"This job, though temporary, was a lot of fun! I love Halloween and the store had a lot to offer. The hours were also flexible and the pay was very good. Most of the management staff was excellent and really seemed to care about the employees."
good,"The people I work with are great. The atmosphere is chill but professional. At times it does get a bit busy, speciallly around Halloween and other major holidays. But never anything too unmanageable"
good,I started as a cashier and a stocker. I like this job because it gets you into the Halloween spirit they have great costumes for all ages and different ideas
good,"The job is great opportunity however there is no way to advance your position in the company , the management lacks the skills to manage the company in a professional way."
good,"For a first job to start making some money and building some saving while going through school it's a good choice. Hours are pretty flexible, except during October but if you are in school and they have your schedule they'll work with you."
good,Party City was a great job that I had while in high school. It taught me basic cashier and sales associate skills. It also taught me to be patient and take the time to assess guests needs and wants.
good,fun place to work at the time. great staff. lots of cool stuff . lots of stores to work at so you can make over time if you want to work at more than one store
good,Job was very fun and consisted of a lot of young and hardworking employees. Everyone too the job serious but that didn't stop us from having fun while working. On some days an employee would get picked to wear a costume and stand outside holding a sign.
good,A typical day at party city when you get to work clock in and go to the office to see what you will be doing for that day. Each job had its own things that need to be completed for that day. Everyday you learn something new. Management was not that bad. The culture of the job was good and friendly. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep a customer happy when there was only so much I was aloud to do.
good,"The work load isn't bad and I don't mind the job quite honestly. The management isn't horrible or anything to complain about either. I enjoy working and like to be on my feet and moving around. I have met some really nice customers and heard a little about their stories as they come in and ask for certain items or suggestions. It's a really fun place to be. My only complaint would probably be that I feel because I haven't been working there for so long, the other employees that have been with the company for a much longer time tend to play favorites. I have been stuck as a cashier (and we call upon our other cashiers for backup so when there's more than one customer waiting in line, we can keep the line going instead of having it build up), I have called for backup and have waited for a long time before anyone showed up, even called for a stock person to help me as I can't walk out onto the floor because I am the main cashier, only to be kept waiting and no one showing up at all. If that is somehow fair to call and wait ten minutes with a customer for an item and not one other employee calls the front for the item or even shows up to see why a stock person was called, then why have people working on the floor? I just didn't find that appropriate nor something I am thrilled about experiencing still. I get that I am new and make my mistakes when making calls over the intercom but I am not giving up hope, and I haven't given up at learning from my mistakes and bettering myself at work."
good,Party City is a good place to work for your first job. Hours work very well with school and other activities from school. Learn how to treat and talk to costumers
good,"I am still currently applied at Party City in which I have worked for the past seven years. Employees learn a lot from team building, teaching, customer service, and more. I would recommend this company to friends who need a place to work."
good,"Even though the pay wasn't great, I loved working here. I loved being able to provide customer service. The holidays were always fun too. The cashiers were able to dress up in our merchandise and just have fun."
good,"There are multiple tasks each employee is expected to do (cash register, stocking, organizing, displays, etc.) but they're not difficult to learn and managers are helpful and understanding throughout the learning process."
good,"Pretty slow throughout the year, busiest time is Halloween. it is very fast paced and sometimes requires a lot of physical work."
good,It was only seasonal for halloween. It's a fun place that got a little hectic at times but thats retail! The supervisors there were helpful and really laid back so there was never any issues.
good,I'm happy that Party City was my first work experience and that I was hired on after the Seasonal opportunity ended.  I learned quickly what fast-paced meant during Halloween season.  The managers were great at teaching me what I needed to know and the team members were fun to work with.  I just didn't see any room to move up and there wasn't an option for any benefits.  It was a great first job and I appreciate the opportunity for experience.
good,"Great place to work, just couldn't get the hours I needed to keep me there.  Was offered an opportunity to interview for a management position, but 2 months went by without status update and I was offered another opportunity and resigned."
good,Great place to work if going to school. Part time and a fun environment! The customers are usually friendly and the schedule flexibility is great. highly recommended.
good,"For my first job it was a great experience, with helpful management. Job requires a lot of standing as you will assist guest when available or maintaining the store."
good,"All stockers and cashiers at a given location are forced to run the store with the absence of the manager. I only ever met the manager once, I never saw him after the day I was hired."
good,normally a fun day creating great party ideas for guests. However since change at corporate store associates are being asked to do more for less. Hopefully the company will survive for current associates.
good,"A typical day is a lot of multitasking, and often very fast pace. It can be a great place to start a career if there was more of a mentorship program with advancement."
good,"Ive loved working for this company,several great co workers. Had it not been for our department being eliminated with hours being slashed in half,Id still enjoy working here."
good,"Working for Party City was a ton of fun! I worked for them two years in a row for the Halloween season. They have the same people rehired each year, so it was like seeing my old family the second year! The management is upbeat and super friendly. "
good,Is a great place to work as long as you have the right team working with you is a great place to grow I love the company as far as wages and benefits but overall I just think to work here you got to have another job.
good,"I was only there for season, but it was really fun. It's a very quick paced and a little  competitive to see who can up-sale most. The manager I worked with at the time was a strict but fair."
good,This is a fun place to work. No one really gets along and the customers are rude. I would recommend for such a big corporation to give better benefits and bump up the pay for management. $9.50/hr is not good for a supervisor.
good,I mean the workers were awesome people. They were jus trike me seasonal. So we wouldn't be there long. That was fine with me. I needed a job for the holidays. But the mangers were mean so I had volunteered to leave once they started to fire people.
good,"Even though it was a seasonal position and I'm sad I couldn't stay there any longer than October, it was great place to work and I would recommend it to anyone. Great management skills, wonderful coworkers, just a great place in general."
good,its a nice layed back seasonal part time job to get some money only bad thing about it is if the store isn't getting any business they'll find a excuse to fire you.
good,Do you like blowing up balloons? that a good part of the day and most of the weekend. Each season or holiday the front end changes to reflect it. Halloween is the biggest selling part of the year so its the only retail job were you can kindda get a break over Christmas time. Other than those things its a pretty typical retail job and if your a hard working retailer you will fit in nicely.
good,Why do y'all force people to fill this out like I was in high school it was ok I guess? idk it was decent and working there wasn't the worst or th best it was ur typical part time job
good,What a great place to work if you like the hustle of the holiday season. Loved seeing what was new for the year but didnt feel that they trained the newbies enough.
good,"A lot of fun working costume wall for the Halloween season, only hard part is having to get on high ladders to grab the boxes on the top of the aisles to stock the shelves. And some of the Halloween costume boxes were really heavy."
good,"Party city taught me more to help other when they were in need, they had question about the store or merchandise. Always had to check up on them. It was a nice friendly environment great management."
good,"This is a great part-time seasonal job, especially if this is your holiday.  Customers are usually great to deal with as well as other employees.  All around great time."
good,A typical day would be steady with customers and tasks to do. I've learned to be helpful with everyone that has came in. My co-workers were very helpful when I was first hired to answer my questions about the job.
good,i mostly enjoyed working at Halloween City. The people were fun to be around and the job was very easy. And was also offered a character reference for working really hard.
good,"Go to work. "
good,"Everyone was very kind and welcoming, and had wonderful leadership skills. It was a fun environment to work in, especially during the holidays. It was a great learning experience and first job."
good,I really enjoyed this position! I shared my knowledge of make up and costumes with the customers and helped put together some really amazing looks. i was able to utilize my creative talent not only with the guests costumes but also in organizing displays.
good,Its was a good job but it was seasonal. The managers were good they would help you out with anything. Every employee wa was working together to make it easier.
good,Typically I would go into work and get my tasks for the day. Co-workers would help each other with tasks. Once at the end of shift we would all clean up.
good,"A typical day at work for me in Halloween City made my day bright full and fun. In Halloween City i learned how to stock and how to use the cashier. Management was not the best but i still did my best to complete every task i was assigned to. My co-workers were fun but also dramatic. In my opinion and experience i didn't have any hard things to do in this job, everything went smooth. The most enjoyable part of my job was watching the little kids try on the costumes and get happy!"
good,Party city was a great job it was temporary because it was seasonal . I helped people find the costumes they wanted for the children then had a Walkie talkie to tell my partner I was assigned with which costume number I needed .
good,"On a regular day, you would check the work list and choose any aisle on the work list and fill all the items listed in that particular aisle until your shift was over."
good,Very fun workplace during the Halloween season. We were able to dress up our normal work uniforms every day. I was able to use my skills to be a very efficient cashier. I liked being able to talk to the customers and help them everyday. My co-workers were great and we always got everything done in a timely manner. The hardest part of my job was perhaps dealing with the angry customers the day before Halloween when there weren't many costumes left and it wasn't really anything I could do.
good,"Started off as a part-time worker working strictly nights due to age an education. After a few years of working in the company I was able to climb up the ladder and become a key holder. This new position allowed me to work close to money, have access to: the safe, security system, special store operations a normal employee does not have access to, having possession of keys to open the building, solely opening the store to get ready for operating hours. Learned how to work one-on-one with customers and to work with the customer till they are satisfied, stocking shelves, inventory counts and adjustments, and planogram new sections in the store. Staff and management became another family. They're awesome and super helpful. Hardest part of the job was following store policy and assisting others to understand the guidelines we follow. Also, prepping new workers and the store for the Halloween season. Best part was seeing regular customers, and assisting them with their events, and seeing how their event went when they return."
good,"A typical day at work was busy, because it was around Halloween. I learned that I can handle stress well in the workplace. Management was nice and kept the employees busy with work. I worked well with coworkers and we had to work together often. The most difficult part of the job was when the influx of customers would come in looking for costumes, and the best part of the job was being able to interact with so many people."
good,"Overall a good place to work, only complaint is the low wages. Everyone who works there is nice, the management can be a little biased at times though and sometimes picks favorites. workload is fairly easy during slow times. When it's busy its almost always understaffed."
good,"On a typical day we had more then 20  balloon orders, not including pre-orders. Maintaining a clean and safe enviorment for our customers to shop. Stocked the floor with new merchandise, which included visual changing. I would normally do visual changes about 2-4 times a week. I enjoyed working with the co-workers I had and I have even developed friendships within that company. Unfortunately I had to leave due to seeing a limited career path with this company."
good,"I enjoyed working at Party City, I would get excited to go every day. I wish I could have stayed but I had to leave due to personal problems. But, the typical day would consisted of stocking, pushing product and making sure the store looked presentable. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and I believe I left a good impression."
good,"A typical day at work is ringing up customers, hearing about their day and building a relationship. I learned how to manage my time under a time crunch as well. My co-workers are extremely helpful and we all work together to get the job done. There really isn't anything difficult about the job, it would only be difficult if you don't want to be there. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the different types people that come in the store, many are from different parts of the world since the store is located near a tourist attraction."
good,"I started with Party City as a low level employee. Within the week I was promoted to floor manager over a temporary holloween store that Party City owned. I was in charge of managing the 50+ employees ( scheduling, organize breaks, etc). After  the season, I was offered my own store and was promoted to General Manager. Party Cities  have a lot of employees ( more so than the Subway store i used to run), but i love a challenge."
good,"When youre sitting there putting your items on pegs, and a family comes in and one of the kids birthday is coming up and they're in the isle deciding what theme she wants for her birthday, just seeing that look on that kids face how happy something like that can make them, is honestly the best part of the job. And as long as their children are happy, their parents are happy also ."
good,"typical day at work was me taking care of the customer needs, handling money & doing transactions."
good,"its a good first job, you learn a lot of skills that you will take with you to other jobs. its a bit hectic during Halloween time."
good,"A typical day at work revolved around keeping my assigned aisles tidy and helping out customers as needed. I learned many things including customer service experience, cleanliness, how to stock shelves correctly and much more. I worked at quite a hectic time so management was all over the place which got confusing, especially when they would mess up the shifts and pays. My co-workers were great, many were very welcoming to the seasonal newcomers and gladly helped us along as needed, they were extremely friendly and helpful people. The hardest part of the job was the closer it got to Halloween, the crazier the store got and the more everything got out of the usual. What I enjoyed most was gaining so much valuable knowledge on the work field and gaining many friends along the way."
good,"I worked for Party City for the month of October and it was pretty straightforward. The three different positions were cashier, customer service, and costume wall. It was a fun experience for the month but it was very hectic as Halloween neared. I wouldn't say it's the best job but it is something fun if you're looking for something temporary."
good,"It was a good first job, especially the time I got employed was around Halloween season. So there  was a lot of cool stuff going on. I learned a lot of techniques on how to stock items and  how to help customers. My co-workers were nice they were all around my age, so I didn't have  a hard time getting along with them. The hardest part of the job was probably getting people their costumes during the Halloween season because they amount of people that were there.The management was good, they were very helpful."
good,"Management did not always seem to know what they were doing. Fun place to work, get very busy some times. Overall a great first job."
good,"Halloween City was actually a fun place to work. I worked with a variety of different types of people. There was never a dull moment there. Our manager was also great! The best part of the job was closer to Halloween when us employees got to dress up as different characters each day. But the hardest part was on the day before, and the day of Halloween, the store was super busy, like Black Friday busy. Everyone was being pulled five different directions by customers trying to get that last minute shopping done."
good,Loved working here! Very neat and organized store. Shelves were always being stocked so customers knew we had things. The balloon counter wasn't the greatest but it was fun at times.
good,I love all my co workers. I enjoy helping costumers planning birthday party's. The store manger is a great guy. He keep the ship running. I've learned how to use a helium tank and blow up balloons properly.
good,working with people is fun when they asking for help and love put on different customs and showing they off and scary people for fun
good,This is a fun place to work with great people. My co workers are great. The hardest part is store wide communication. Also last minute decision making on the corporate level.
good,It is one of those jobs you hate to love. The job pushes you to the breaking point. But as long as you keep on trucking though you will be happy with your accomplishments at the end of the week.
good,It was something different that was good to work in especially during in the holidays. I liked the way they had it organized for the parties and etc.
good,"Everyone on the staff seems to be entirely in-tune with each other.  We get along great, and work-flows like a well put-together ballad."
good,"Get's quite bust at times, but with the fun staff and excitement this job brings, I'd go back with this company!"
good,"every morning would count certain items to make sure they were accurate. perfect seasonal job for Halloween, coworkers were great to work with."
good,i did Alot of things with this organization from sign shaking to handing out balloons to learning production lines of finding use full product pricing and racking  due to fashion standards and pricing but to be priced for somebody who does not have the money to buy a pair of jeans for 300$ from the retailer
good,"A typical workday was pretty busy, I learned to be even more patient with customers. the employees were great to work with and easy to get along with."
good,A typical day at Halloween City would be fast paced and extremely intense. There was no down time. Registers were always busy and the floor always needed picking up. Management was wonderful and such a great help when i was faced with a challenge i could not face alone
good,"Overall, Party City was a good work enviornment. The people were nice and management was awesome. I just wish that they were not a seasonal job."
good,"I have learned what retail is. We must keep the store clean and help customers out when asked. Or asked them if they need help finding things. I have excellent co workers always helping  me out if I need it. I love being cashier because time goes by faster. I love blowing up balloons that is always fun. The hardest part is keeping the store clean while customers are still in the store because, they are always putting things where it doesn't belong."
good,I enjoy my job at Party City but my schedule changes week to week and it is hard to balance work/life.  The job and upper management in this company is great.
good,"This job is not for adults unless you are willing to work as management. I went to school for graphic design and that's how I got the position. They had no advancement for what my skill, so I didn't want to stay at a job with no growth for what I am interested in doing."
good,Enjoyed working here. Very fun enviornment and were very flexiable with my school hours.
good,Great place to work. Meet new people everyday. Management and co-workers are great.
good,"At Party City, I did allot of different things. Some days all I did was blow up balloons and making balloon displays and boquets. Other days, I would do basic Cashier duties such as run the register, or go around the store and clean up or ""zone"", and always provide the best customer service. Party City is a store that supplies everything you would need for parties, and costumes. Halloween is the biggest Holiday, so that was the best part of the job. You are constantly busy helping customers with costumes and the line goes up and down almost every aisle! This was a fun job."
good,Starting Salary for managers is great until you divide your hours worked by your pay. Fun atmosphere though lots of people around halloween
good,"I learned how to work a register working in Party City. Also , some of my mangers were not professional and rude . The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with new people everyday. The hardest part of the job was when there was very few customers because i had to find things to do."
good,It has it's busy days and its slow ones too. We work as a team and help each other out if needed.
good,Usually a calm day but it does tend to get busy at times especially around certain holidays. My people skills grew from my experience there and my customer service skills as well. My co-workers were very helpful and caring to one another. Nothing really. being abloe to put on the prop's and to aid the customers to what they are looking for.
good,"A typical day included use of the register, providing good customer service and stocking. I learned how to handle fast paced environments. Management and my co-workers were very good, there was a great line of communication. The was nothing that I considered hard but the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,Awesome place to work. It is fun and exciting! I guarantee you will enjoy it.
good,"You always had something fun and exciting to do, whether it was stocking costumes or helping customers find what they needed. Understanding costumes and all things halloween related was the most fun, and you always found something new, fun or entertaining. The managers were all willing to work with you, if it was scheduling or understanding a task. Most of the people that worked there were also enjoyed the job making it fun to go into work everyday. The hardest part about the job always comes the week before and leading up to halloween with all the last minute people upset cause they can't get the costume they want, and it's is difficult to explain that being prepared means we can get them something a week before especially if it is a popular costume. But often it was as easy as suggesting some of beat ideas until they hear something that appeals to them. In essence this was and is may favorite job."
good,My manager were very easygoing. They sincerely wanted to know how you were feeling. The hardest part is not getting the amount of hours that they promise you but you don't end up getting because of the number of people that they hired. My co-workers were cool. Some of them were around my age while others were older. The best part of my job was seeing the expression on the customers face when they find the exact thing they were looking for for their event.
good,Great place to work if you enjoy customer service. The company is still trying to figure out what kind of management it wants and which way it wants to go for the future. Several decisions are not properly thought out and they work everyone too hard for what little hours are provided.
good,I love my managers! Saturday Mornings are the best because of all the balloon orders! This type of  job is more for students because of the random cuts of hours.. so expect hour range of 5- 30 if you're lucky. My team taught me a lot of about management and inventory. It's my first job and I'm going on 2 years but don't expect raises unless you have a badass manager other than that only temp kind of job.
good,"Its a job"
good,Everyday is an adventure at Party City. Party city helps in developing your skills with management and employees. the only draw back is Halloween. that is there actual xmas season. the best part of the job is being able to put a smile on children's faces as you help plan their party
good,"Party City was amazing, i sorry i left, had other things in my life at the time that need full attention family matters. would love to go back"
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced and fairly stressful at first but once settled and organized the day goes by expeditiously. People who work there as a first job learn how to keep calm and handle stressful situations so to keep everything and everyone working and happy. Management had a lot on their hands due to the season but kept all the workers stress-free and in order. Co-workers were extremely friendly and more around my age but worked very hard to keep everything going efficiently. The hardest part of the job was keeping customers stress-free and to stay organized to make sure everyone in the store got everything they needed for the season and are happy with their purchase. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers of all ages, becoming more comfortable with a retail work environment."
good,"I worked to Party City at their temporary Halloween City location and it was one of the best jobs ever. What other company will let you get dressed up in a costume every day for work and at the same time it helps promote their business."
good,Seasonal work. Easy money to be a cashier or management for a few months
good,"The best part about working for Party City would have to be the People you get to work with. Quickly you all become a pretty close knit group of people that are willing to do just about anything to help you. Also getting to work in a fun environment is a plus. "
good,"Work was always fun, except when it wasnt busy"
good,"Able to meet knew people constantly through out the day, laid back place to work"
good,Great place to work. Dealing with kids and parents help find decorations for parties and holidays. Everyone got along and the managers were very lenient.
good,"For a first job, it was a good one, very fast working environment. "
good,I work at Party City every year during their Halloween time. Customers are pleasant here. Lots of freight to be done during all hours. Always something to do.
good,A typical day included restocking the costumes and recovery of the store
good,"There is always something to do while at Party City. If you're not doing something, you're not doing your job. I love that it always keeps me busy and on my toes. There's always new levels to my job that I can learn and I feel that my ideas for the store are also listened to. The In-Store management is a wonderful team. They are supportive and very informative. They're constantly teaching me how to better myself and preparing for advancement, whether it be within this company or with another. The co-workers make it a fun enviroment to work in and truly make this a team store."
good,"Holloween City is a great place to work, they give you hours that work for you. A typical day at work was; Helping out customers to find the right product then helping them to find the right add ons with the ""Head to Toe"" sales plan. The management was laid back, easy going and very helpful. The co-workers were very fun and goal orriented.The hardest part of the job was telling the customers they could not use our bathroom! The most enjoyable part was making the consumer happy. ""A smile is worth a thousand words."""
good,I enjoyed working at party city for the most part. sometimes it wasn't always as fun as it seemed but never the less it was a good job that i would at for almost 2 years.
good,"Going into work was always fun. I enjoyed working with the people there. Management was good, though there seemed to be a bit of a problem when it came to communication between managers. Some of the co-workers also had very little respect and tended to take more time for a break than to work which resulted in more work for the rest of us. They hired a few too many people so hours were usually very limited and didn't help when money was needed. I did learn how to communicate with customers and how to make sales effectively. I enjoyed meeting new people and being around the customers."
good,You help people plan parties and help them select merchandise that will make a special day even more memorable.
good,"Some days were better than others, due to the amount of customers that came into the store. I felt that all of the changes between the holidays, could've been done a bit better. Halloween time was the best time, because it allowed you to dress up and be so interactive with the customers, which was something that I liked."
good,"The management in and out of the store are amazing and helpful, the director is supportive and listens. Head office support is also really good. The staff is mostly decent."
good,"After working for another Halloween retailer previously, I was thankful for an opportunity to build a store.   Hard work but rewarding if you are willing to exert the effort."
good,"I had worked there for 5 1/2 years. I enjoyed working there, but needed more money and they said I was maxed out. They offer tuition reimbursement, health and dental benefits. The pay was bad. My favorite time of the year to work here was during halloween. I loved working on the weekends and being up at the balloon counter and at the custom invitations and banners (Inscribe)."
good,Being hired into the company was like being invited to the longest and coolest birthday party with friends! I had so much fun and gained a lot of experience in retail services.
good,Working at Party City was always a fun environment. Where there was never a dull moment. Party City gaught me a lot of small but new experiences that i have used since working there. Party City was great. I loved having this work experience.
good,"Halloween help. Over all I was treated fairly and was given the flexibility for my health issues at the time, the worst thing about this job is the running from one end of the store to other with angry customers and your manager yelling at you."
good,"I was working at first as a seasonal worker, which was fun but also kind of overwhelming at first but got added on as a regular part time worker what was fun but also a little dull at times."
good,"I've worked here for a year and it's a good job if your a young teen (16 years) and need any experience for stock, cashier and customer service. Overall a friendly environment and a learning experience in the retail business."
good,"Working at Party City was very fun. I held a Halloween seasonal position. Even though my position was brief, I got to meet a lot of new people and gain good experience."
good,"I liked working at Party City. Slow-paced store unless during Halloween or Graduation. Task-based job. 1-2 tasks given for the day, then you can close or go home"
good,"This is a good job for teenagers or people who are looking for their FIRST job. I worked here for two years and left making 9.00/hr. The environment is fun, relaxed but can also be very fast-paced."
good,Party City was pretty fast paced. At times the check out line would be super long but I got it knocked out pretty quick. I am very social and love talking to people so the customers usually had a pleasant visit after coming. I would often do returns as I would be running the front and I would help clean the store after closing.
good,"Honesty i really enjoyed my job at Party city, but there was a major flaw in what i was working at. I know time takes progress bot Party City was not paying me enough to were i felt like i could support myself. The pay was great but after a while i realized that it was not enough for me to progress with it."
good,I like it there. It was a great environment. They understood that sometimes I couldn‚Äôt come in due to my children being sick. They are extremely friendly and just very helpful people.
good,Party City was  a fun place to work at because of the high energy everyone had there. Everyone also taught me the ropes around the store and whatever i needed to know about my job position.
good,Great place to work for high schoolers and young adults. Good percentage off on merchandise. Very busy place on the weekends. Flexible schedule for all.
good,I would usually only work on the weekends. And because it was October I would help customers pick out a costume for the Halloween season and I would help watch the fitting rooms.
good,"My managers are great, I like all my coworkers, and the job is easy. The only things bad about it are their standards are too high and expect you to finish a lengthy task in a short amount of time, and the hours per week are inconsistent and low."
good,fun and enjoyable job. its is very easy and other associates are really helpfull i enjoyed working there for a minimum of time  . itsss really easy and you can get the hang of it really fast
good,"My manager was awesome. Had no problems whatsoever at work. Came to work did our jobs, got along well and went home. Smooth sailing if you couldnt tell."
good,"it was very fun to work at party city and the managers were very nice and flexible with hours, its hectic in the halloween season so if you are easily stressed do not work here during halloween season"
good,"You clock in the second you enter and from there on its simple work for the most part. As someone in the back dealing with the costumes, it was very stressful during the holiday rush of Halloween. A fun work environment where everyone would be socializing and would recommend to anyone as one of their starting jobs."
good,Party city is a nice place to work friendly staff. Great job for slow paced work except during Halloween season. Great party and costume items for all seasons.
good,"This is a great beginner job for people just starting out. Everything is very simple to learn and it‚Äôs low stress. However the pay is low. If you are just starting out the pay should be fine, but if you already have a house and family it might not pay the bills."
good,The place is not that bad to work if it's your first job. Totally fun work place and the coworkers made the place were very helpful and everyone helped each other no matter what.
good,"Hands on experience in taking and completing balloon orders"
good,Party City was my second job and I stayed for two years. I loved my co-workers and gained great knowledge of being a sales associate at Party City. It taught me the correct use of a register and handling money properly as well as what comes with retail as far as merchandise and customer service.
good,"My job was to great the customer,cashier, and stock everyday. I learned to listen to customer and suggest different product to their needing's. The manager was good helped with the customer when busy. The hardest part of the job was the inventory count it was always off. The best part was working with customers and being able to help."
good,"During the month of October, every day was a really busy and fast paced day. But during any other month, it was usually pretty slow and relaxed throughout the day. While I was there, I learned how to use a cash register, how I should act and what I should do if customers get frustrated or if a customer tries to steal something, how to stock items quickly and finding where items go, how to better manage my time as well as what to do with my time, and how to clean up the storing during closing time. The managers were all really great and helpful throughout my time working there and helped teach me what I know. The workplace was generally really relaxing and pleasuring because of the people and how they went about things. The hardest part of the job was probably finding items during October because of the amount of customers that would misplace things along with the angry customers that got mad because they couldn't find what they were looking for."
good,Most fun i've had on a job ever. Loved the concept . Liked the way they did resets. I had to quit after some personal matters arose due to my mothers illness. Had to move back to Buffalo.
good,Work is easy and pay starts at 7.50/hr so if this is a second job i would recommend it. However you do not get a lot of hours. Saturdays are super hectic for cashiers with having to do balloon orders.
good,Not a bad place to work. Management too pushy on collection of email addresses and or phone numbers of customers. But if you like planning a party or throw lots of them this is the place to work.
good,"A typical day consist of unpacking costumes and working the picture wall where the customers figure out what costumes they'd like."
good,"The staff was very chill and relaxed, they made the environment fun and enjoyable. It was a job good for when you are currently enrolled in school. I would highly recommend for a student in school."
good,It was a very good work place I‚Äôd work back there.  Typical day at work would you just belong peoples round the store making sure everything was in place.
good,"Party City is a franchise so the owners we had were very hands on and very much care for their employees. I most enjoyed the the customer service part when it came to birthday parties or balloons, the seasonal things were enjoyable as well.Hardest part was getting out so late during the Halloween season since that's the biggest hit for them an then going in early the next day."
good,It‚Äôs a fun and busy place to work. Very organized and planned holiday merchandising and marketing techniques.  Halloween Season is a blast! Balloon orders are a daily and fun way to interact with customers.
good,"This is a place that is great for high school students along with college students. It's only seasonal, so there is not much to expect from a facility like this."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Party City. My manager always told me when I was doing good work and I really appreciated that. If you‚Äôre a competent human being with a work ethic, you should fit in just fine at PC. It‚Äôs a lot of busy work, but for a part time job, it was easy and good work."
good,"While I worked during the busiest part of the year for Party City, it was by far the most fun I have had at a job. Since we were encouraged to wear Halloween costumes, many of us had fun dressing up, and eventually took advantage of a generous employee discount. I also worked with some great people, and the staff in general had a lot of fun during the season."
good,"stock shelves, operate cashier, greet/help customers. clean back room."
good,"When i worked at party city it was my first job, I put back returns, helped customers around the store, found halloween costumes and processed items on the floor."
good,"I absolutely loved my time at Halloween City. The team I worked with was really good to work with, and the job itself was both challenging and fun. My only issue had to do with two employees who didn't seem to keen on doing their job (i.e.: not pulling costumes when I called back for them), but other than those two, it was a great job."
good,This company is a good one to start off with. To learn customer service and promote to supervisor/key holders. I did not care for my management team but that did not mean that I didnt learn a lot in the time I worked for this company.
good,"The time I spent at Party City was a fun, relaxed period. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the atmosphere. The weekends typically were the most busy times of the job, more in the morning time. The team helped all of that go smoothly. In my time there, I learned how to cashier as well as put together displays and aisles. I never planned to stay long term, but it was a great first job."
good,"Over all, I enjoyed my time working at party city. It was a great learning experience for me. I feel I learned a lot about giving great customer service and hands on interaction with the customers."
good,"it was a summer gig an the only work i can think of but with my time spent at party city it was well worth it, my seniors who looked over at what i did was supportive in its own right"
good,"Fun place to work, only downfall I was laid off.  They kept any manager with not as much experience.  I would considerate accepting another position, even with being laid off.  Relaxed store operations."
good,"For Halloween City we had one day to build and complete a temporary store so as long as it would take. as for the Party City side we where doing remodels and gone from home 3 weeks at a time."
good,Excellent job for learning both proper customer service as well as warehouse responsibilities. Even during rushes felt like the only struggle was time rather than the work itself.
good,It was a fun and light atmosphere. Everyone was nice and we all got along well. I made new friends and enjoyed helping customers find costumes. I was able to use my creativity is designing the costume display and kept busy organizing the costumes and keeping the store neat and clean.
good,Very organized fast paced and very busy very competitive and hands on you have to have a clear mine set around  Halloween long lines reasonable pay and understanding  manager's
good,"manager position, second shift manager. Handled all scheduling and counts at night, handled all money drops, entering merchandise and closing up the store."
good,I enjoy going into work every day as each day brings me new challenges. One of the difficult parts of the job is accommodating every employee's work schedule.
good,"Being a seasonal position, our management team tried to make everything as easy going as possible while keeping up with the fast paced work. As Halloween approaches, the days get busier and busier. Provided you got lucky enough to find a good team, everything is smooth enough to make it through the season."
good,Many people assume that Party City must be tons of fun to work at; it's not a bad place to work but it is still work. Definitely a more relaxed environment then others and that's probably due to the nature of the store and how the customers are while shopping. Still requires your typical day to day workload though with freight and clean up.
good,"It's a pretty fun retail job that has really cool seasonal changes and you meet a lot of interesting people coming in to purchase party supplies. However, you get paid barely above minimum wage to do a lot. It's debatable to someone that hasn't worked in a Party City store."
good,"Good work environment, job security, great benefits, quality of life, competitive pay, quick translations for seasonal, lots of different themes for party's or get togethers, one stop shop for parties"
good,"This was a great place to start working, would get really busy during Halloween time. learned how to stock shelves and make displays for new product. Spent most of my time making balloon displays."
good,It was a fun environment to work in. Many of my friends worked there which was my favorite part. It was a seasonal job so it was okay. There was no hard part of my job. Just this manger that was rude for no reason.
good,"You must answer phones with in 2-3 rings. Take balloon orders over the phone and in person. Fill balloon orders and walk in balloon requests. Help customers find what product is best for their event. Make sure the front of the store is neat and clean. Customers are both the hardest and most enjoyable part of the job, so you need to be good with people."
good,if you need a second job or your first job then its good for you. During the season they ask a lot of you the management expect you to always be available
good,"Typical day was handling inventory, be it stocking, receiving, resetting aisles, setting up store layouts, and of course helping customers.  Best time was setting up for Halloween."
good,"-A typical day was helping customers to the fitting rooms and keeping track of merchandise or stocking and organizing aisles."
good,i actually liked working for party city but the one thing i didn't like is the way they went about dropping there season workers. Other then that party city was a great learning experience.
good,"lots of hard work is needed during the seasonal parts of the year but the people, customers, bonus potential makes it worth it.  If you have any previous retail experience its fairly easy to get hired as a keyholder however there is intense training."
good,"of course around certain holidays it will get hectic especially halloween but overral working their it is fun , you get to help many people and dress up ."
good,"Party city was exactly what you'd expect. A low paying job, but the work load reflected that. The job was very simple from day to day, with Halloween season being the only time that is actually stressful. Overall, it was a decent part time job."
good,"At the time they just took the people that they got along with instead of the people that qualified for the job,besides that I loved working there."
good,"I have enjoyed working in this environment, but the lack of future progression here is what keeps me hesitant in recommending it to anyone. It's good for a part time job, but it's rare to make leaps and bounds in progression beyond your current position."
good,Working at party city was a lot of fun and the coworkers and management were amazing. though my job was seasonal it was still amazing and fun and I would consider working there again this Halloween season.
good,"management here is pretty awesome, and I have enjoyed working here for a few years now. I would say it's great for a first job or as a summer/part time job"
good,"Had a problem with the hiring "
good,"I think that Party City is a good environment to help customer out. You learn a lot about what it takes to throw a party. It is always changing seasons. It is like a family. You have your good days and your not so good days, but they are always willing to work with your schedule."
good,"Working at Party City was mostly routine on a regular day. The maintenance of the store was fairly easy, the stocking was routine and the pricing changed on occasion. The most challenging part was when it was time to change our merchandise based on the time of the year. The transition was hard on some customers and the availability of the merchandise was scarce during these transitions. The most enjoyable part of the job was being a part of a celebration or event. Aiding our customers and making their event perfect was the best part of working for Party City. I learned that team work and hard work make a company great and our customers will keep coming back so long as we provide the best customer service along with team work and hard work within our store."
good,"nice place nice people. scheduling as far as hours go can be sparse, however they make up for it. if you're a crew member take the opportunities to set up stores"
good,I either was cashier or helping customers around the store. Work with inventory and merchandise. It was a part time job. The manager and coworkers helped each other out and was never drama. Everyone got along great and we all had great communication.
good,"Working at Party City was a great experience. A typical day at work would usually involve restocking shelves, handling money, go-backs, and occasionally inflating balloons. Working at retail made me learn a lot of things such as handling situations with shoplifters, using a cash register, or what to do in case there was a injury. In my opinion, management is never fully perfect with any company because we are humans & we make mistakes but which helps us learn from our mistakes to become better employees. The workplace culture was a positive one, my managers always pushing me to achieve greatness. I would say the hardest part of the job was the time frame because I was needed in several places but not enough time. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and getting satisfaction from helping customers completing their transactions."
good,"As a pop up store, it didn't get a whole lot of love. We were using dated systems and the customers left the place a mess. It could get incredibly boring when things got slow and there was a never ending pile of things to put away"
good,"typical day consisted of helping customers find what they needed, helping them find something withing their budget. a typical work day was always fun because all the coworkers got along."
good,I had a great time working for them everyone was very polite and welcoming. It was great to meet new people. The managers were great and very understanding with everything. They explained the things I didn't know and helped with what I needed.
good,"I worked during the Halloween season which became quite hectic, but the work was not hard and customers were usually pleasant. Managers were not laissez faire, which is good, and they were not too bossy either."
good,"I worked here my last couple of years of high school. It gets super crazy for Halloween. Many get hired but only a handful stay. Its a typical job. Cleaning, cashier, stocking etc."
good,I really enjoyed working there. It is a fun and exciting place. Always on the move. The hours are very flexible and  my boss is very good at her job. The way how our store ran like a good fit family.
good,"The job was a energetic work environment at the same time enjoyable. You'll learn many job skills as your working somewhat of an endless training because the managers will always find the time to teach you. If you don't enjoy high levels of interaction with people or don't have the need or motivation to learn something new before stepping in the doors, then the job is not for you."
good,"I worked for the highest selling store in the South. It was a challenging environment, but I loved every minute. There may have been a few things  that I would have disagreed with, but that was more of a store issue not the company"
good,"Always changing the floor setups,  Productive and a busy work place. Never a dull moment with the everyday procedures and tasks that are time sensitive."
good,"Fun and busy atmosphere.  Required to work overtime on a regular basis.  Sometimes traveled to other store locations to assist in store setup.  Store is constatnly changing, which leads to overtime."
good,Fun working environment. Taught me a lot on how to greet customers and help one when in need of a certain product. Great first job for myself and taught me a few things about being great in customer service.
good,"The most part about the job I have been in gave a friendly vibe and more to work experience to were I didnt feel bored and look foward to going work, to get my duties done and help an extra hand ,I enjoy my team associates. What I learned you work in a face pace type enviorment you boost your ability to be in that position to over to be more fast in the time you have to learn I would be ready."
good,"I worked there for 4 months. All I did was clean the store and stocked merchandise. It's a lot of work to do. But it's keeps you active. My work experience there was somewhat enjoyable. But I can't complain, the pay was good."
good,"A typical day at Party City wasn't bad and it's actually really fun, but because everyone is really nice and friendly. The management was good and a bit better than the other most recent places I've worked."
good,"Working at Party City was not difficult at all, the store was empty during the week and tasks were not difficult. The hardest part of working there was saturdays when everyone wanted to get their balloons filled up for their parties. But the working environment was great and working there was a blast."
good,I started off as just Register and Balloon Counter then worked my way around Freight and Merchandising. The workers and the work itself was fun and focused.
good,"I learned many things at party city, how to decorate balloons, learning how to do a Plano gram and recovering a store! Management was not always the best but I stayed for 4 years because of how much fun I had with the other employees and customers. The part I enjoyed the most about this job was during Halloween we got to dress up and decorate the store spooky!"
good,"I was work at party city as a seasonal job , I found it  comfortable with my hours and the coworkers were helpful, the store was a clean environment ,  The management was good"
good,"A typical day at work included organizing and stocking the store floor with products. Also, assisting customers in finding or suggesting costumes and accessories. I have increased my social skills through communicating with customers. Management was a bit confusing. For a seasonal job, management changed five times. Some workers were very good people and excellent workers. The only hard part of the job was a personal problem that did not seem to affect anyone else. I enjoyed most aspects of this job, but interacting with customers was most enjoyable."
good,if your looking for your first job id recommend trying out party city it gives you a good balance of busy and laid back days they train you well and give you good hours.
good,The hours were extensive which was difficult for me due to the fact that I was a senior in highscool at the time but overall the workplace was energetic and welcoming.
good,I learned how to be a team leader and work well with others. The workplace was great. Peers were great. The location was perfect from my home. Very nice
good,I worked as a cashier and would always find it little to no work required in terms of working with my fellow coworkers. The customers were very compliant with a person who would just be learning the ropes and therefore made the experience even easier for me to learn. As for the other things while working here I really like the communication with coworker to customer as they rarely did not have any issues after interacting with one of us.
good,"I loved working with the public and assisting customers with their party needs, some people were had no idea how or what to do to plan their party, some people were searching and hoping that they'd get suggestions from us in the store."
good,"The store atmosphere is amazing. Besides the music, which is very corny yet catchy, the store is cool. The job as a sales associate is fairly easy and simple. Literally anybody can do it. The staff is fun and easy to communicate with. The managers are really helpful and understanding. The hardest part of the job is interacting with rude customers. Having to hold your composure while dealing with them can be very overwhelming. Overall, the job is fun and perfect for anyone who is just starting out in the work field. Halloween is a really busy time for party and people do A LOT OF LAST MINUTE SHOPPING which is very stressful because the customers act like everything suppose to be all peaches and cream on the very last days of the season after all the stuff been picked over and taken already."
good,"This is the best job I've ever had. All my co-workers make it fun to work here. A typical day at work involves setting plan-o-grams, running a register, stocking merchandise and blowing up balloons."
good,"Work here is rather simple in the sense that the day to day job doesn't drastically change. Not to say that it isn't interesting however, as a quarter of the store routinely changes in part with the upcoming season's and holidays. The management team is friendly and willing to work with you. Co-workers become a small family as not many of us are there because the store isn't particularly busy during the year besides the Halloween season. The job requires patience and an ability to work with people planning to put a party together and are looking for suggestions. Overall, a great experience with numerous event's and occurrences to look back on and reflect as well as learn from and apply to new scenarios."
good,"A typical day at work consists of running here an there. Everyone is always on your feet. Customers come in constantly that are in a rush so the employee has to help them find everything as quick as possible. The hardest part is having to remember where everything is, because every month or so the things change and or things get added on. "
good,"Party City is a fun company to work for as you get to watch kids eyes light up when they get their favorite character on a balloons or see their superhero waving to them outside. "
good,A typical work day was always busy and fast paced. I learned how to interact with different customers. The management was great and understanding. My co-workers were friendly and always in a great mood. The hardest part about the job was trying to keep up with cleaning up after the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet all kinds of people and having a close relationship with my co-workers and managers.
good,It was an overall good experience. The co-workers were nice. Fun work environment. No room for advancement after season is over.
good,"This company has taught me a lot and doesn't keep you in just one area.If your interested in a customer service job, they will literally teach you the fundamentals of customer service and retail."
good,It was a nice work environment and everyone was nice to work with.  I learned many tasks throughout my time there. The hardest part of the job was having the weight of other people's responsibilities on my shoulder and for the amount of work the pay wasn't too great.
good,"* i have learned how to conduct business better"
good,"A nice place that doesn't actually feel like work, but more of an enjoyable workplace. The environment is fun and easy to work in."
good,"I loved working at Party City! The environment was exciting, my fellow employees were fun to be around. I loved the customers that would come into the store as well."
good,On a day to day basis we would work on freight or restock the sales floor with any extra merchandise we had. As well as working on new projects for the store. I learned how to use the stores computer to look for merchandise the customer was looking for as well as memorizing where most stuff was at in a matter of days. Party City management was very professional but knew how to have a a good laugh here and there.
good,"easy aslong as you just do what they ask of you "
good,Performed customer service. Making sure the customers left with a smile on their face. Had to make sure the customers were happy with  their balloons. Made sure the store was very clean throughout the day. My co-workers were all friendly and everyone got along with each other. The hardest part about my job was trying to be perfect with everything because I want to grow as a person. The most enjoyable part about my job was seeing customers happy with my service when they left the store.
good,"Overall I enjoyed working for Party City, though it was extremely busy with the holiday, the experience was fun and a great learning experience. The management team was helpful and understanding. The only real hard part for me was getting used to the size of the store and where all the merchandise goes. That said, because it was during Halloween, I enjoyed getting to wear some of the accessories they offered for costumes."
good,"Fun environment, always busy.  Sometimes loud with kids excited about getting a costume."
good,"My days were very busy and high paced. Goes perfectly with who I am. I prefer a busy day to a slow day, more people I get to enter act with the better. I learned so much this season at Halloween City. Most important thing I learned and will take with me everywhere I go is how to Manage a full team. How to make the job fun and successful at the same time. My employees were amazing and I kept my whole crew the entire season (which is not easy to do being a seasonal, minimum wage job). The most enjoyable part of my job was and always will be the interaction with the customers wether it be phone calls about an item or face to face interaction. My day was successful if my customers walk out, or hang up that phone happy."
good,"Party City is a fun and vibrant place to work, especially around the Halloween Season. The only drawback is the lack of a corporate identity or mission, and a culture to hold it in place, perhaps due to the seasonal nature of the job; in order to increase sales, this is important; employees need the sales training and the affirmation of their manager and corporate culture."
good,"great co-workers, Young and energized working envirinment. A very busy place for holloween. very boring during the off season. easy work. great hours."
good,Loved working here. Great people to work with and good management once the management was steady. Overall would recommend working here.
good,"when i worked at party city it was only for the holiday for October, i was only 16 and did it for experience i like working at that place and enjoyed working there. the people were great and wish i could have stayed on as a part time person."
good,Fun Job! You get to dress up in the costumes! You get to meet a lot of great people and learn a lot. Sometimes there's pizza days.
good,"Typical day at work was open the store, getting things around. What I learned was you don't trust some of your co-workers. Management team worked good together. Hardest part of the job is when a manager quits and leaves you short handed and you and another team lead steps up and run the store and doing 50-70 hours a week for a least 3 months. Seems like no body understands how wore out you can get. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all the different kinds of customers."
good,"The people were friendly and the work was good, I enjoyed every minute of working there. The management was quite good, they were friendly and made sure that the work was getting done."
good,"Party city was one of the first jobs I achieved on my own, i was a bit frightened going into something new but i followed directions and asked questions when i didnt understand something. a typical day coming into work would be putting my belongings away, dressing up, then clocking in. After i clocked in i went to my assigned position. usually i was fix up the isles, or i was do the fitting rooms which required monitoring how many costumes went in the fitting rooms, how many came out and actually cleaning them."
good,"Employees can build their customer service skills through this company. They can learn how to work under pressure in very busy times of years (Halloween season, especially), and improve their sales skills."
good,"Working for Party City I noticed the company puts forth a lively image and encourages employees to get into the party spirit. The team of associates are trained to work together while managing independent tasks. Management was always approachable and offered constructive criticism. However, a few co-workers were more unprofessional, lacking discipline in the work environment. The most challenging aspect of the job was balancing in-store customer service and receiving calls in the back room."
good,"Just cashing customer's out with the occasional need for running the balloon counter."
good,"This company doesn't always hire or promote competent or qualified employees.  These types of employees are given way too many chances after making errors or just not getting the work done on a consistent basis.  The pay scale is fair and the schedule is consistent.  When the managers put in for employee pay raises, it takes months for them to get it in place, but they are fairly consistent in their attempts to get the process moving."
good,Would stock store and then take the boxes to the dumpster. During the season had to get costumes for customers. Help clean store at the end of the night
good,"A typical day for me is preparing the store in he morning for customers. I pack out boxes or fix and label a planogram or I merchandize a new section of the store. "
good,Worked with Customers on a daily basis -Worked well in team with Co- workers -Demonstrated ability to solve problems under pressure -Worked with large amounts of people under time restriction -Generated ideas on the spot -Kept customers happy and provided alternative suggestions -Spoke fluent Spanish with customers that needed help
good,"When I started it was during Halloween, it was neat seeing everyone's different costumes and getting to dress up a little bit was fun. A typical day would be a manager tell you what position you have that day which could be balloon station, cashier, or floor which would include stoking inventory and helping customers. This was my first job so I learned all about customer service and how to be professional. I really enjoyed working with my manager he was so nice and patient, especially knowing its your first job. Loved my co workers, it was nice meeting other kids outside from school. The hardest part would have been during Halloween season the store was full of customers and sometimes it was overwhelming. The enjoyable part was it was fun all the time."
good,productive and fun workplace. flexible hours.i worked about 18 hours a week because I was balancing school. I love my managers and I feel comfortable working there. the hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting a paycheck.
good,Party City provided me with the opportunity to work directly with customers and to assist them with their party supply needs. The difficult part was the frequent change in management and adjusting to different leadership styles.
good,"This is a very fast paced seasonal business. This job is not for everyone; you must be very fast thinking and flexible."
good,"Loved working here. Fast-paced and fun, was never bored. All co-workers were super friendly and close in age rage, got along with everyone really well and enjoyed being around colourful party supplies!"
good,Great temporary company. Loved the people that i worked with and all the wonderful customers that helped us through the season.
good,"The atmosphere that surrounded the Water Park made it a great place to work, had a lot of fun, and good vibes."
good,well i only worked there during the Halloween season so everyday was pretty hectic. the management was cool and my co workers were fun to be around.
good,I had to count the cash before and after. I worked the register. I would help costumers find what they needed. and when closing clean my assigned isle. I learned how to work the register. My co-workers were fun to be around and thy were nice. The most enjoyable time was closing because while cleaning out isles we would help each other and have a little fun.
good,"Worked the Halloween seasonal job for the month , very busy with customers getting their costumes or children's costumes , but the other employees tried their best to help each other to make it go smoothly."
good,"Successfully completing projects on short deadlines and familiarity with opening and closing tasks"
good,"Subway was easy work. There was great management. I learned lots. Nothing was hard, however. The best part was the fun co-workers."
good,It was a great place to work. I'm even going back to do another seasonal job there.
good,It is a very simplistic job where you stock and make sure the product are placed in their proper position as well greet the customers and assist them.
good,Party City does most if not all of its hiring at Halloween. It's a great place to work. A really fun environment if you like families.
good,"I went in everyday to work with the understanding that I would meet someone new that day and have a good day at work. I learned how to multi task with helping customers and maintaining a clean work area. Management was always around to offer good advice on how to better improve my work, co-workers would do the same and be very supportive. The hardest ‚Äì more... part was being able to try and help everyone at once, the most enjoyable part was finally being able to figure out how to speak to everyone and making sure their needs where met and they left happy."
good,"Now, I only worked here as a temp for Halloween. But it was fun! I would do it again if given the chance. Everyone was nice, everyone worked together. The only thing that's a con is the minimum wage."
good,"I believe that going to work means helping others and also helping your self. In order to help others, you have to have a caring heart to even put your effort into helping others.  When I go to work, I am always getting my job done on time, or even before the time I am asked to do the job. I am never late to work, I don't take off unless it is an emergency. I enjoy working because I enjoy being successful, I believe if one is not successful, they cannot live a happy life, that is just my opinion. I am willing to take on any job and requirements that comes my way, I have to strength to put my all into any job I am blessed with."
good,"When it comes to doing security you never know what to expect , "
good,what liked about party city was always having work to do it was never really slow and that's what I liked about working there.
good,It was fun to work here just the only thing i did not like was that my hours were cut down to 4 hours per week
good,Being a cashier i dealt with different personalities and it helped me learn how to deal with them. Our policy was to make the customers happy and that's exactly what we had to do.
good,I only worked during the Halloween season. However I had the best time with the customers and the employees.
good,"This position is most likely not around anymore, but I really enjoyed it. My co-workers where really great and the management was pretty easy to work with. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the daily screaming kids the store was filled with."
good,"cashier, oversee front end activity, "
good,This is a fun place to work but opportunities for advancement are few and far in between and the pay is not great.
good,"This place is fun to work during Halloween, other than that its very slow to the point where I had to work only 4 hrs a week and I had to quit and find something better"
good,Come into work and stroll through the aisles and help customers on anything they need. Help restock shelves as the day came to an end and begin the same ritual the next day.
good,"Working for Party City is certainly a crazy party experience from meeting new people, making balloons to being around crowded areas, constantly moving and just having fun. This job had lots of positions to work from cashier, balloon counter, freight, stocking, down stocking, picking up merchandise, putting back merchandise, taking customer calls, price changing merchandise, and from moving to organizing merchandise shelves. The most enjoyable part of this job was working on the Halloween holiday month theirs lost of hours and long hours. You get to dress up, get to work in crowded areas, theirs always something to work on and constantly moving in a fast pace mode. On regular days its slow from Monday to Thursday and on the weekends its a little busy. I really enjoyed working here i learned so much, met lots of new people, worked with lots of new people and got plenty of hours the best part is theirs always customers purchasing lots of things for their events. Unfortunately when it comes to thanksgiving and Christmas month it gets to be really slow and that means hardly hours. The hardest part was i had worked for over 6 years and didn't receive much of a raise to support myself so i decided to look for a better job in a better career."
good,I learned more about customer service from that percpective and built my experience in this type of industry.
good,Organizing the store putting everything back where it belongs. Usually gets really crowded on holidays but we still managed to keep things up.
good,"The company has a great goal, to have every customer leave happy. They try to keep positive attitude and greet almost every customer that walks in the door. Tho they need to be more of a team player and need a better system to function. As well as management needs to communicate better with associates. The company has an amazing system im place called ""We Help"": Greet every customer, offer a basket, find out what there planning for, offer solutions and pruducts, and help them to the cash wrap. To assure the customers have a good experence and returns for every event they plan."
good,"In the IT Dept. there never a time to rest. There's always something to work on; from the Store Network, to Store Equipment issues, to assisting Store Managers thru there daily store operation issues. Follow by: New stores opening, to store relocation, or store conversion. There was always something new to learn, and after 14+ years of experience, I was considered the big brother of the Department. I taught anyone seeking help, how to approach an issue, how to take notes and how to keep control in a rough environment. Halloween is our biggest and roughest time of the year and working with the store manager is a challenge. You had to be professional, efficient, and encouraging. These characteristic made you a very successful Tech Support Analyst... To get that ""thank you"", or Good Job!! from your store manager is the best part of the job. Helping others is what I like to do and Party City Corp. gave me that opportunity."
good,"As a Seasonal Manager, my day usually consists of checking my aisles for outs and flexing in merchandise to fill all outs. The hardest task of being the Seasonal Manager is that the seasonal aisles needs to be worked on everyday because it's the first thing that you see upon entering our store. What I enjoy the most is working with employees who come to work, to earn their paycheck, and don't have a problem successfully completing any task assigned. Being in management has taught me well as far as being a leader to the point that I feel that I can successfully run my own company in the near future."
good,pretty good overall . Didn't have enough hours. I learned how to handle difficult customers. I liked the fast pasted fun environment
good,Helping people find what they were looking for.
good,"I usually went into work around 9 A.M to 5 P.M. When there is few people working durning the school day the store gets kind a crazy, I liked my manager although she needed a little more training. My co-workers were very nice and was easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job would have to be when everybody was in the store all at once wanting different things. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I made a differents in a customer."
good,"Fun, creative and open-minded environment. Will always love this place to work at."
good,"typical day consists of opening the store at 9:30 sharp cleaning windows and making sure all morning balloon orders are complete. As well as greeting customers and helping them with any questions/concerns they might have. Management wise there are some that lack in their title more than others. My co-workers were very friendly and kept everything strictly business. The hardest part of this job is accepting all the new managers that are assigned to our store every few months, the duties overall were not hard. The most enjoyable part of my job is feeling welcomed with comfort."
good,"Working for Halloween City is hard work because so much is compacted into the short season, but the merchandise is a great value, the decorating and merchandising is a hoot, and the kind of people who want to work there are lots of fun."
good,working here was very basic and simple. there is no drama in the work place and the staff are all hard workers. the festive atmosphere and happy customers was nice too. i never dealt with a difficult customer here.
good,Party city is all round a great place to work. flexible hours a great environment to learn in and all around just great co-workers. The only problem is the management is very sexiest so unless your a younger better looking girl there really is no chance of job advancement within the company.
good,I worked here during the halloween season and it was so hectic! But super fun because of the people and coworkers. I didn't mind working extra hours.
good,is a good work environment but i do not work there anymore so i doubt this review is actually helpful it has been 5 years since i have been there. it was really nice and the co workers were all friendly.
good,Untapped strategic potential. Company has growth opportunities for customer facing and ease of transactional process flows directly effecting consumer facing
good,Party city is a fairly good job starter job for getting into retail. The managers are pretty nice and encourage you to succeed. The general manager will set you up to succeed in your workplace. Job duties are easy and can easily get accustomed to within a week.
good,"Got alot of feedback on jobsite when needed to ask "
good,"I enjoy working the season of Halloween, it's fun to work and actually have fun while working, I enjoy helping the customers with balloons and party planning."
good,I enjoyed working there they really let everybody do what they wanted but I always got busy fast they work at a good paste but always short on employees
good,Really love the staff and management. Corporate is beyond stupid and dont know how some of the stores work. Store 264 works their butt off because of it.
good,"I enjoyed working at party city, but the noblesville location had a really hard time keeping the employees that were hired in, which in turn resulted in low staff count and unstable scheduling/work hours."
good,"Customer interaction"
good,Good family type atmosphere to work for. You have a good balance of home and work life. Great first job for students and stable for employees with families. Best time to apply is in August and September for the Halloween period.
good,Good place to work for teens. I enjoyed the work place but didnt get paid enough for everything I did. The management team I had was awesome and the discounts were good too.
good,"I started off as sales associate with the company and managed to move up to Front End Supervisor, which I enjoyed quite a lot. And for the next few years was completely okay with where I was. Until recently the company decided to do away with the FES position all together, their reasoning was to give the associates the ability do returns and  etc. And for actual managers to be more engaged with The customers. So now it‚Äôs just frustrating that I can‚Äôt do any kinda overrides.  What a terrible decision on Party City corporate reasoning"
good,"You get to see people's faces light up and work with creative people. You get to work cashier, costumes, and even balloons. It's a cute environment and you even get discounts. Great for people who enjoy costumes and creativity."
good,I had a great time working there except whenever one manager was in. She wasn't nice and many customers complained about her all the time and she actually almost made me cry in front of a customer after I asked for help with the change so I could make sure I got it right since I hadn't dealt with change a lot before that . The customer could see I was upset and actually came back after she walked away and told me not to worry since he had trouble with change sometimes too.
good,"A typical work day involved ringing customers on the register, and working on a daily task of some sort that would be assigned by a manager or supervisor."
good,"Party City's level of business shifts throughout the year. Halloween, New Years, graduation season, and the Super Bowl were hectic, with longer hours ans busier days. However, the store's managers and coworkers were all extremely friendly, helping to relieve any stress during job, and provided guidance and assistance. The store also provided easy, flexible hours to work with."
good,The management at my store was excellent and that made the work fun. I know at other stores the managers are not great and corporate is clueless on the day to day operations of a store.
good,"While working for Party City, I was working at a seasonal store for Halloween.  The management was great and worked with your schedule.  At the time I had college classes 3 days a week, and they had no issues scheduling me around them."
good,"Have fun rearranging the store around to accommodate for the seasons. Getting to know your customers and helping them make the best out of whatever event they may be holding whether its for parties, birthdays, dinner gatherings, and weddings! Not to mention getting creative with helium balloon bouquets!!"
good,a typical work day is you would clock in and then look whee they want you to be. i have learned how to have good customer service and also how to handle money
good,"My managers were wonderful and genuinely cared for their employees.  Overall, it was a great experience even if it was only part-time. I learned a lot of job skills and learned to adapt to different situations in customer service. The hardest part of the job, I would have to say, is trying my hardest to please every customer. The most enjoyable part, though, would be the people. The atmosphere was kind and friendly which pushed us all to work harder. I learned that most people respond better to gentle encouragement."
good,"The job is fine, but it is not the kind of job one would rely on to live off of. That is a big no no for me, honestly. However, I had very little in the way of choices."
good,"I worked part time as a store associate, working on putting costumes in boxes and grabbing them for customers, as well as helping customers within my ability around the store."
good,It was great opportunity and also in the area that I enjoy dealing with people and supporting them in there needs. This job experience was very enjoyable due to the nature of the sales.
good,"The store's layout is ever changing; which always keeps you busy. If you love people and love to work at a fast paced environment, this is for you. There are always many projects to do."
good,In a typical day you would spend a couple hours going up and down the aisles cleaning up after customers. The management was okay. I was scheduled during school hours a couple times and it wouldn't be changed even though I had brought it up multiple times. I enjoyed the friends I made there. Even during the fast pace during Halloween it was enjoyable and not too overwhelming. The thing that did overwhelm me was walk in customers that wanted balloons blow up; sometimes the wait was up to thirty minutes for the balloons to be blown because there were too many people.
good,"A typical work day consist of stocking items, down stocks, cleaning, ringing up item & hadling customers and money. Management is ok. I learned how to properly inflate balloons. The hardest part of the job is down stocking. The most enjoyable part is working the floor."
good,"Majority of my friends work here as well, so it doesn‚Äôt necessarily feel like work. Everybody is incredibly nice. Hours are flexible although sometimes it is hard to even get hours."
good,"Typical day at work is working on balloon orders and stocking.  Learned how to treat customers and how to get along with others.  Management was always helpful.  Work culture was great, had a lot of fun.  Hardest part of job was Halloween because of volume of customers and short fuses of customers.  Most enjoyable part of this job was my fellow employees and being able to help customers get all their party needs met."
good,"It provides training to its employees, has daily meetings with associates to set goals, weekly meetings with supervisors to plan and set workload. Also provides health benefits and 401k"
good,"If you've never worked somewhere I feel that Halloween City is a great place to start. It is simple enough and Halloween is a very fun holiday, I recommend it."
good,"While at party city, I have meet wonderful people. The enviorment is friendly and cozy.  During the morning it's slow but even-paced which nbn is great,but I like the few moments dur in ng the day when an hour feels like 10 minutes because of how bbn usy it is. Wonder job, I recommend."
good,My particular store is very team oriented. Both management and regular employees help each other out. They're very flexible with the schedule and will work with you.
good,"I really enjoyed working here because I just like the environment. Also helping the customers pick out items"
good,I like party city you meet new people everyday the next day is something new. On some days there will be customers unhappy because coming to the store they probably didn't get what they came for. You going to have to have a clear and calm mind to work with the upset customer.
good,Friendly and joyful work atmosphere. Pretty laid back job for the most part and isn't hard what so ever. Can get very busy during seasonal but other than that is a regular pace job.
good,"I worked as a sales associate and I liked my job."
good,"Alot of reviews talk about difficulty with tasks, labor, and/or co-workers.  I've seen where associates & managers alike fall into those traps all in the name of being ""compliant"" with expectations.  Those who are ""committed"" to execution of the plan have empowered their team and themselves to be successful."
good,"This job is a typical retail position. It involves regular stocking and inventory maintenance as well as customer service. My favorite part of this job is helping customers create their ideal celebration for big moments in their lives. It's nice to step outside of my usual bubble and see what's going on around me. Outside of the customers, this job is very routine, which can become boring. Overall though, it's one of the better retail positions anyone could have."
good,Fun experience for a seasonal job. My managers were nice and very accommodating with my schedule for the most part but they were very forgetful. I would remind them i wouldn't show up to my Wednesday shifts on time because i got out of class on time and they were very understanding but would always forget and ask why I was late. It seems like the message never got through. Besides that everything went smoothly and great.
good,A very good entry level job. A great place to learn skills useful for future and more advanced work. Managers are very lenient and very helpful. They know when to be serious and when to be friendly.
good,"As a store associate you recover the store, ring on the register, help customers, fulfill balloon orders, stock shelves. Management at my location was great. I became friends with a lot of my coworkers. Halloween season is pretty stressful. As long as you do what is expected you'll be fine. Some days are slow, other days they expect you to do more than is possible during your shift, but they are usually pretty understanding."
good,"5 hours a week, different position every work shift"
good,"I worked seasonal at Party City and I loved it. It was my first official job with an official company, I definitely wish I still worked there. Although around Halloween it is very busy, the employees and management are very understanding."
good,I enjoyed working at Halloween City.  It was a fun place to work.  The associates and managers were nice and helpful.  I would love to work for this company again.
good,"The typical day at work would require for me to either be a cashier or an associate on the sales floor.  If I was working on the sales floor, I would likely be stocking shelves or cleaning up the store.  I learned skills that are necessary to have when working in retail stores.  Management has always been very welcoming and willing to teach. They make the workplace a comfortable work environment.  The workplace culture also makes the store a comfortable place to be.  The hardest part of the job comes when it's a busy time of season and there are a lot of people requiring most or all of our attention, it makes it difficult to give the customers as much attention as possible.  The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with my coworkers and solving problems with one another."
good,"I only worked seasonal for Halloween but overall it was nice."
good,"I did temporary work here at party city was a fun place to work although you were on your feet and very busy its a place you can stat busy in from working the registers, front floor helping customers or organizing the shelves is hard work."
good,"I was a career opportunity intern during my time at Party City, garnering work experience for career training. Even though my management knew this, I felt that while I was working in the store there was more they could have asked for me to do than what I was given."
good,People there and productive and enjoy what they do! Party city is a fun environment to work at. Management do there job correctly. Customers are also friendly and grateful.
good,"I did like party city Halloween costumes was a good sales at party city, the general manager gave mangers more hours then the employees i opinion I didn't like it."
good,"I enjoyed working at Party city, it was just a part time job my senior summer before I went to college and the managers knew that and kept it pretty relaxed."
good,I enjoyed working with the employees setting out merchandise for different occasions and events. Setting up Halloween was especially a major time like Christmas.
good,Relatively relaxed most of the year but graduation season (summer) and Halloween are very busy. Corporate is rather understanding and supportive as well and when you're off the clock you're really off.
good,"During my time at Party City I worked as a Cashier and on every odd chance as restocking on the sales floor, the hours were decent but the pay was low, mostly a part-time job."
good,Loved it and would work there again. it was professional but still open enough that it wasn‚Äôt stressful or hard to come into work each day. The mangers were absolutely phenomenal. The pay seemed low for how much work we did but you can‚Äôt expect much out of a seasonal retail job.
good,Great place to work. I mainly work on setting plan o grams and free setting products. I'm also a part of management so I make sure the store is ran smoothly. I make sure the store is appropriately decorated and set according to the seasons we're in.
good,"A typical day for me at party city was unboxing and unpacking candy and filling the sales floor and top stock. Learned time management skills and people skills. Management is very present and helpful. I'd say the hardest part of the job was learning to multitask and manage my time well to complete my task for the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alone in my section, because getting the job done by myself was satisfying."
good,Was a slow paced but honest job with co-workers who were willing to help. Although not enough hours you would often get called in for more hours if available.
good,I was usually blow up balloons or stock the shelves. I would also recover the store some times. Great learning experience and very supportive staff. Great place to work.
good,you start your mornings figuring out your job duty. cleaning the work place than getting yelled at if something is not done when you have a limited amount of time and no direction on how to do things
good,"I adored working here, I simply did not make enough money to stay. I was in a bad position in life at the time and needed a larger pay raise than management was able to offer. If i could get the pay I needed i would definitely go back."
good,"During Halloween it is very quick paced and customers get angry very quickly if they do not receive their costumes right away. "
good,"I started working at party city as a temporary cashier in October. They decided to make me a permanent cashier position towards the end of October. At first my hours were fine; I'd work almost day but after Halloween was over I was only given 8-9 hours every week. "
good,"job here was easy, customer service. stocking, cashier. it was slow most of the time but in Halloween season its when the high paced is required. good environment with the workers there too."
good,"Great, temporary job to learned the overall customer service experience. One will learn how to engage in conversation, with customer, meet quotas, have goals, and organize. Fast paced, and fun atmosphere."
good,Management was fantastic the whole time working there. The job was very fast paced and there was very little downtime which kept the staff very busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customers.
good,Working at party city was a lot slower but more satisfying. I enjoy helping customers find what they were looking for and working with my coworkers to help customers receive what they need.
good,Great environment with lots of fun people. I would still work here if the pay was competitive. It's unfortunate that they lose a lot of great people due to the lack of pay and managments lack of knowledge.
good,"An average day at Party City for most is ringing and blowing up balloons, taking balloon, ribbon, and banner orders, also organizing the entire store while putting out merchandise. The hardest thing to deal with on most busy weekends were dealing with certain customers. Blowing up balloons and taking orders is time consuming and very fast pace but can also lead to being backed up and having irritable customers. The most enjoyable times at party city are the seasonal times like Halloween because employees can dress up in costumes , as long as its appropriate for the work place."
good,I enjoyed the time working for the company while it lasted. I was only with them for the Halloween and thanksgiving season. We kept busy during this time and I had wished I continued working here.
good,"It was fun for awhile, the store wasn't very busy so there wasn't much to do. I prefer to work in a fast-paced busy environment. Overall, it was a good experience."
good,"Going to work talking and respecting others as do unto you, knowing what you are to do when you clock in. communicating with manager and he listen , get compliments on your work sometimes give early release and bring in Dunkin donuts."
good,Great place to build up networking skills and effective retail skills in developing your work experience. It is a lot of fun and a lot of opportunity to build interpersonal skills
good,Even though this was a temporary job for me. Working at party city was a great experience for me. It taught me a lot about working under pressure being that I worked during the Halloween season.
good,"although a seasonal position, this is a fun environment to work in--if your holiday is Halloween.  Friendly environment, ability to assist customers with decorations and costume selections"
good,"Very easy, learn alot if desire and great way to start as first job, great way to start using your customer service skills, and be a party planner expert"
good,Its a very fun environment to work in. The only down side is the fact that most of this company's locations close down after the Halloween season is over. It's a great place to work at.
good,"A typical day at work is maintaining a good environment while greeting and helping customers. Greeting the customer with a nice smile as you ask if they found everything while at the cashier helps ensure good customer service. Working at Halloween City was a good experience that I am happy to have, I learned how to maintain a cash register, stock, inventory and work on my customer service. Although the cashiering was fun, it was also one of the hard parts of the jobs for me. It was my first job and I feared that I would mess up and not satisfy the customers. However, whenever I felt that way my manager always smiled and was there for me and push me through it and eventually it became easier to cashier. Working there was a good experience for me as an individual I have learned many things and overcome things. The smiles on the customers faces as you realize that you helped make that smile happen by helping and talking to the customers; that perhaps was probably the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"The environment is professional yet enjoyable."
good,"The staff was very polite and professional. If given a chance to come back I would work there again, hopefully moving into a career in corporate. Management was awesome!"
good,"Great teamwork, goals meant together, management was fair. There were no hard parts of the job just had to be consistent in everything that we wanted to accomplish."
good,"My day usually is going to customers and helping them receive their order. I learned that customers were very important  and their satisfaction was key.  The workplace was a little fast paced, but can be still manageable.  The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers and discussing of what they liked about our products."
good,"I had the best team to work with, the employees were great and management was really great too. The store manager really did a great job in creating a great work environment."
good,"Party City is a fairly good place to work. Management is good, employees are enjoyable and it's fairly easy to work at. The way they handle crowds can be a bit of a handle, but otherwise, often goes well, with management of crowds and exemplary customer service."
good,There are a lot of tasks that need to get done for the Halloween season. The people who work there are very helpful when I had a question. A lot of productive work days.
good,"It was a very cool job, I was in high school at the time so I couldn't work that mean hours. But it was a seasonal job for the Halloween season, after the holiday we was laid off"
good,My experience with party city was exciting and wild at the same time. When working in a environment like party city during Halloween is very exciting you get to pick out the customers costumes but the work have to be quick. The management was very strict so we couldn't enjoy the costumes like we wanted too. My overall experience was fun and I really enjoyed it.
good,"This job was great for me while in highschool, despite the laid back non busy work environment it was a great job that I recommend to those in need of one. They were very flexible with hours and shift pick ups."
good,It was a decent starter retail job that had its pros and cons just like any other job. I would definitely return to that job site if needed or requested.
good,"The company is a fun place to work at time, but it all depends on the people you working with. In general a typical work day can go by fast, all in the days work."
good,working with halloween city opened my eyes to the world of training employees. At halloween city the management team made me feel although I was just as important as their customers. I learned new skills and was trained how to train employees. The atmosphere was fun but professional and overall was a good experience.
good,"This review is written from my time there which ended in 2007 so at that time the company was very hard on us as managers to get things done and done right all the time but the if we achieved that then the rewards were plentiful. However, the company was bought out and the culture changed and I only heard it has gotten worse and 80% of the managers I knew when I worked there has either been replaced or quit."
good,I love my job!!  Company is downgrading so my position is eliminated. I've learned a lot and grown in my career. I've met many people and built lots of relationships.
good,Typical retail manager schedule of 10 hours with a lunch.  Fun product selection and the customers enjoy their shopping experience.  Hardest part of the job is the low amount of hours for associates to get the job done.  Most enjoyable part is working with a team that cares about what they do and enjoy the job.
good,"I enjoyed working at Party City, I was able to take my time in the first beginning to find out how to use the machine. After three days, I was able to work proficient  and fast."
good,"It was a seasonal job. "
good,"This jobs was a good one for a first job, I enjoyed my coworkers and the job in itself. Management was good, the lunch breaks were standard 30 minutes. The jobs hours could vary, even though I was part time there were 8 or more hour days, usually weekends."
good,"Party City was another awesome company to work for. The management was great, everyone was always helpful and friendly. The job itself was not strenuous, it was a typical cashier job. Cashing customers out, answering the phones, taking balloon orders in person and over the phone, stocking shelves, and keeping the store clean. It was both and independent and dependent job. Would recommend for an employer."
good,Fairly simple tasks. I learned to respect other retail associates and clean regularly. The manager was racist which was a downside of the job. The workers their are friendly and lovely to work with
good,"Most of the time, you are encouraged to dress up in order to get into the party spirit and project the fun in party city's atmosphere."
good,"I've always enjoyed my time working for this company. The constant changes in sets in the store and the rotation of new product makes for an exciting work place. It is fulfilling to meet new employees and train them to know the store. The constant change, however, can become overwhelming and challenging in certain stores."
good,"It was a temporary job. All you had to do was unload a truck, go through all of the boxes, change prices (if necessary), get rid of damages and sort the merchandise into different boxes based on their location in the store. It was an easy, full-time job that paid nice."
good,"Location is fun and advancement is easy if you do your job, co workers fall flat. "
good,Working at PartyCity  was and great experience . My co-workers was very nice and willing to assist me in anything that I need help with . My employer made my schedule to fit my work and lifestyle !! All and all it was great !!
good,"Have a good open , respectful mind going in there. Try not to have an attitude all the time, you'll get frustrated easily. Get along with everyone especially managers"
good,a lot of stocking and putting product back. working at party city was fun and a good environment but also wishing it was longer than just part time. it got my stocking experience up.
good,Managers were nice and the enviorment was made for a group to work wel together throughout the holidays. The hours were not much but overall working at party city was a nice experience.
good,I'm like this place for work because is really funny and comfortable for work party city  bring  you  a  lot  of  opportunities  to grow  in the  company
good,"Loved working there! Just wasn't getting enough hours to support myself. 15-20 hours per week 30 min breaks. It was right down the street from my house so, very convenient:)"
good,"Typically I would have to help customers find the party supplies they needed, more specifically I only worked the month of October so I mostly helped them find costume related supplies. I learned valuable customer service techniques, and got used to being on my feet for long periods of time. I was able to get along very well with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was helping customers who weren't fluent in the English language, but the job was still enjoyable because Halloween is my favorite holiday so I was able to surround myself in decorations that truly bring me joy."
good,"My typical day at work is interesting for me. Management is anxious to see my sales reports and they give me a lot of insight on how the business is run. In addition to the knowledge they share with me I have learned a great deal of knowledge on Excel and Access."
good,"You are not really monitored to do well, nor encouraged for that matter."
good,"Party city is a great company everyday was something different. In this job you would have to come in and let a manager know your in already. then the manager would tell you your task of the day. it could be from being a cashier , being the balloon specialist , cleaning the floor and working on put backs , or helping with a special assignment such as remodeling a section. it was an easy and flexible job. such a great experience."
good,I've learned many useful skills from working at Party City. Customer Service I would have to say was the biggest and most rewarding one of them all.
good,I have learned how to blow up balloons. The hardest part of the job is serving the customers with limited communication.
good,"Fun place to work, it's a party store for customers and employees"
good,"I worked temporarily for the Halloween season. Met a lot of neat people, hours were flexible, and the manager was understanding."
good,The job provided good training for the basis of providing customer service as well as basic cashier training. A typical day would include working cash and stocking shelves when the store was quiet. The management was excellent as well as the other associates. The most enjoyable part of the job was providing people with customer service making them happy.
good,Party City is a good place to work while going to school.  It is a business based on marketing celebrations so the customers are most often positive when shopping the store.  So long as you are a hard worker and willing to keep busy it is an entertaining place to work.
good,Working here gave me the ability to meet different types of people and different experiences. It also gave me the ability to be creative with helping customer decorate their events. Management and co-workers were friendly and welcoming which made working here enjoyable.
good,"Plenty was done with the help of every employee, with good understanding skills we were able to keep a good team and handle everything in time with every employees help."
good,"This company is great for developing customer service skills as it is very involved with the customers. You also get the chance to learn the basics of being a cashier/front-line worker. Lastly, this company also teaches you how to maintain and manage inventory and stock."
good,We were able to wear costumes. we have funny experiences with  costumes. Customers were friendly and talkative. We will joke around with each other and have a good day.
good,"Workflow was always busy."
good,"i think the job was good for my first time working , it wasn't hard and i learned how to talk to customers and help them i also learned how to multi task, i learn how to use a cashier and how to learn balloons i also learned how to deal with busy hours and mad customers . my typical day at work was cashier and cleaning and helping customers i like my job because i worked with good and positive employees and i got a lot of hours how i wanted to ."
good,"Great atmosphere, with wonderful management. Always a change in your daily activity and lots of opportunities to learn to skills such as , building displays, arranging shelving units and creating new visually stimulating product displays during a regular shift. "
good,"Fun work place with great manager and welcoming staff."
good,Management is very understanding about scheduling needs. Great working environment. I've been able to expand my knowledge of retail.
good,"I worked for this company twice. The second time, as a manager. I enjoyed going to work everyday. Everyone from the staff, to the customers were a pleasure to work with."
good,Fun workplace.  Learn a lot of different things. I love the people I work with including some of our regular customers.   Its fun to help them make there experiences great. There is room to move up in the company which is my goal with any company.
good,This job was an amazing first experience. When i first got there everyone was ready and willing to lend me a hand. Eventually we all became close like family. We were all very productive with our work
good,"Always a job to do so you're never not on your feet. Everyone you work with is very understanding and is always positive. Management was always changing, but never had a hard time adjusting. The hardest about the job was keeping up with the kids that leave messes in the toy sections. The best part about working there is the atmosphere and all the kind employees."
good,"Encouraged to wear costumes and accessories, it was a fun time. I really enjoyed my time at Party City. I would have loved to stay had more hours been available to work."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of putting on the costume of the day, clocking in, and then tending to the duties specific to the zone assigned that specific shift. If I was working the picture wall or the costumes I would be in constant communication with other associates to assist costumers as quickly as possible, especially during Halloween season. My co-workers were all diverse and very fun to work with! The management was great, very professional. While with Party City I learned how to multi-task and how to deal with a multitude of customers at once. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people create who they're going to be for Halloween, and the least enjoyable part is the actual Halloween rush."
good,"I loved this job, worked here for 2 years until, they opened up a new store and replaced the best managers with other people, thats where everything went down hill and now its not the same as before, it looks depressed when I walk into the store. New managers don't know how to handle certain situations."
good,"Everyday was always a great work environment at party city, the workers were truly a team that watch out for each other. Management team great."
good,Party City was an intense environment with a 6 month store re-set preparing for the Halloween season.  It was enjoyable and challenging
good,It was a cool place to work during Halloween. The customers were very nice. It was fun helping them find their costumes. I just wish I  was taught how to use the register but over all it was a good experience.
good,"Work was easy and quick to do. There was always something to be done and on occasion other than Halloween season there would be a large amount of customers. The work days were usually slow and most time is spent on the floor recovering the aisles and checking on customers, asking what would they like to purchase today. Hardest part of the job was when we had no work to be done, no work to do or people coming in made things slower and boring. Personally I enjoyed the Halloween season when the store is most packed and we have a constant rush."
good,Preparing for the next BIG holiday/season while celebrating the one your in. Halloween was our time to shine. The entire store staff and temp staff participated in becoming a corrector with full costume throughout the selling season. The hardest part of the job was the number of SKU'S
good,"maintained the store clean"
good,great place to work with flexible scheduled and friendly workplace
good,Going in with no experience and this being my first jpb i lvoed it. Flexible hours . There was good team effort. Lots of stock and long hours on your feet but a fun place to be during the halloween season
good,"While working with Party City, I went from a Seasonal Part time Sales Associate who learned to recover the store, pricing items, provide an organizational environment, and selling products. But now that I have been promoted, I've learned new areas in the store such as setting a planogram, working in the receiving area, and etc. Working at Party City allowed me to be more communicative and I work with an awesome team to teach me new things everyday. As part of my job I like feeling the joy of helping a customer the best I can."
good,"Arriving at store location to open or relieve fellow co-worker."
good,"A typical day at work would be setting up and stocking the aisles, blowing up balloons and helping customers find product they need. Management was good. Co-workers were always helpful.  The hardest part of the job was moving a ladder to get a pi√±ata down.  The most enjoyable part of the job was just being there."
good,"Working for Party City for 3+ years was the best thing i could have done. While working for this company I learned different skills like: responsibility, team work, how to provide outstanding customer service, to solve problems in an effective/creative manner. I also learned  to adapt to change and have attention to detail. I have to say Party City had the best management I have ever worked with from just a key holder all the way up to the district manager. Management there was always willing to help on any situation, work with our schedule, teach and coach us to learn different things. The hardest part working there was getting good hours. The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with all the change in seasons and accessorizing with each one. I also enjoyed working with all the customers and all my co-workers."
good,"I was a cashier so I was up in the front greeting customers and cashing them out when they were ready to leave."
good,"A typical day at work consist of being on cash register , answering the phone and helping customers"
good,"Halloween City is a seasonal work environment meaning it is very fast paced, much more then a basic retail company. Every task is done in a crunch time and can easily be changed at any moment. I learned how to manage a team and help them grow together to make the store run smoothly."
good,The hours varied but I mostly worked night shifts or double shifts. I learned a lot but mostly how to build a store and tear it down. The hardest part of the job was working with a manager who didn't really understand how to distribute good work hours and would sometimes mess up the closing of the registers making us stay sometimes 30 minutes to an hour later. It wouldn't have been bad if it had been once but this was multiple times.
good,"‚Ä¢	Handle sales transaction and train new employees on store policies and customer service"
good,"a typical day at work was a very productive i was hired as a seasonal associate for halloween i worked customer service calling the back room threw a walkie talkie for costumes for the customers. all associate rotated calling costumes. so when i wasn't calling for costumes i was sent to work the fitting room. when customers weren't around to try on costumes we were in charge of front facing, pulling forward and filling in empty spots in the isles with products. co-workers all worked as a team made sure everyone was doing good on water ever task they were assigned. manager was equal to all the employees there was no favortism going around. there was no standing around. the job wasn't hard. the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find everything they needed having them leave happy and not upset."
good,Above average work environment with structured task yet allowed management to think outside of the box.
good,A day of work is always fun to me helping the customer get the costume they want for Halloween and seeing them try it on. I learned to quickly and efficiently work in a hectic environment. Management is always cool but knows when to harden up on the employees. My co-workers are always fun to be around and make a day at work better. Hardest part of the job is dealing with certain people that don't know their limits. Most enjoyable part of the job is looking at the children and how happy they get when they got the costume they wanted.
good,"this was a seasonal job"
good,its a very family oriented store so professionalism is very important.
good,"A typical day at work started by clocking in with a pin code and fingerprint scanner. Then we started right in with stocking and organizing displays, as customers entered we would greet them and offer our help if they had any questions or needed assistance. We would also manage fitting rooms for customers who wanted to try their costumes on before purchasing. After the doors closed at the end of the day, management would count out our registers as well as the safe. Then they would either appoint one of the assistant managers or myself to escort them to the bank for a scheduled end of day money deposit. The management and coworkers were some of the friendliest people I have ever worked with. They were also very responsible and each one kept to their tasks diligently. The hardest part of the job was actually organizing the displays because the store manager was very particular, but the most enjoyable was helping customers get their perfect costumes and accessories especially since we were trained to be knowledgeable about our products and we could see them leave completely satisfied."
good,working at party city was such a fun experience. I loved working with and getting to know all the people that worked there before me. I worked there during the Halloween season which is one of my favorite times of the year so the whole experience was definitely a fun and exciting time.
good,I learned how to help people in a stressful situation and also learn how to help sell our stores product in a non car salesman kind of way. The hardest part would be creating the balloon orders because it can get very hostility with customers not cooperating with our store rules. Working here has definitely taught me patience and reasoning with customers.
good,a solid first job. easy going coworkers. some of the customers are difficult
good,The few months I volunteered to work at party city through ROP was amazing. I learned to work with quick pace. My managers were nice but strict. My co-workers were all respectful and persistent in their work. The hardest part of the job was making sure I helped a customer to their fullest needs as possible. the most enjoyable part was the satisfaction of completing all objectives that were given.
good,"typical day: where we were busy and I was the only employee for about a few hours and it was extremely busy and it was a stressful but I was able to handle everything in a calmly matter."
good,Long hours and lots of dirt but well paid. Free lunch with small break room but acceptable standards. Las Vegas heat outside for 12-15 hours is unenjoyable but if you can handle it for a few weeks then its good.
good,"A normal day at work is normal, such as it's pretty slow in the mornings nice and clam. What I learned in Party City is a lot of customer service, we deal with a lot. Basically everything I now I have had experience before this job. Co-Workers are the best!. Every helpful. When I started everyone was nice. The hardest part of the job, nothing in this job to me was hard. I have worked in retail all my life so dealing with customers is a plus for me. The most enjoyable part of this job was some of our customers, you get to see most of the time the same buying customers. Also working as a team is every joyful to me."
good,"after the company went corporate things really went down hill, no raises or end of year bonus and vacation time was not good, corporate always pushed up up until no time because of seasonal time..they wanted the older timers out.."
good,Great team work ethic and Managers. Our duties are always carried to completion.
good,"I was only able to work during the Halloween season but while I was there I had the best time ! You got to dress up, and be yourself. You got to help out little and big kids find and try on their costumes. The ONLY bad thing about working there is having to leave."
good,"A typical day at Party City is balloons, answering phone calls, and assisting customers on the floor. It was a lot of fun, and I was trained in created banners and invitations. The managers were funny and really nice."
good,the management is amazing and work with you every step of the way. I loved working of them and the associate are friendly and helpful.

good,"During my time at Halloween City, I learned many valuable skills, such as management, basic introduction to logistics, how to ship and receive products, how to operate a stand up and sit down fork lift. The company gave me a great opportunity to grow and better myself on a daily basis. My co workers were fantastic and made the job much more enjoyable."
good,I loved working there.

good,Job has a decent envirnoment. Learned how to enhance my already excellent customer service skills.

good,i liked this job because i was in the a/c and its very easy to just stock selfs
good,"A typical day at work would be relaxing, but busy still where there was business. I learned to help the customer find what they came to the store to look for and respect all customers. I got along with the manager and the other co-workers at work equaling a friendly environment. The hardest part of the job is dealing with multiple things at once, it can get tiring and exhausting. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid at the end of the day for your hard earned work."
good,"Fun atmoshere, very relaxed environment. Management was excellent and very understanding to personal needs in day to day life. Everyone had a charisma about them that made the day fly by and make you not even realize you were at work."
good,very easy paste job with great people. i learned people skills and a lot of sales from this job. i also learned how to run a store and how organization will pay off for the next day to come. the most enjoyable part was working with my co-workers.
good,"A typical workday would be resetting plan-o-grams, repaper walls. Cashier, customer service. Delegating assignments to all employees for daily tasks.  Follow through to verify associates stay on task."
good,"They were okay , no problems, very clean and everyone was nice. I enjoyed the work it was easy to learn and easy to get to work. floor management is very strict but if you work hard and pay attention it shouldn't be a problem."
good,The company was very fun and everyday was different.The staff was friendly and understanding all the times. I enjoyed my time there and the opportunity they gave me.
good,"Prepping the store to open"

good,"I worked at a Halloween pop-up store that ran from the end of August to the beginning of November. So, what I did was a lot of set up and fast-paced work. I was the youngest working there and both my managers were sweet ""moms"" that took care of everyone."
good,"They created a good working environment for their employees, and also had a good relationship with their employees. They had the most hardworking management team."
good,"This review is for the seasonal position at Halloween City rather than Party City itself. The job was a lot of fun, very relaxed environment, and easy (though busy) work. Typical retail environment of assisting customers with their purchases. The employee discount is generous and appreciated. Overall had a great time here."
good,"While working at party city, I learned about about the job and people. My job allowed me to meet many different people and taught me how to deal with people better than ever!"
good,Fast paced an a lot of merchandise movement on hands  is a must for managers to keep in pace with time sensitive moves and keep merchandise moving lots of POG's
good,This job will make you go crazy at times but will teach you a lot of patience and help you increase better communication skills with customers. You will have more then one job hat at the store and it will get a little crowded but will teach you in different levels overall. Enjoy!
good,Party City was a great work environment. I learned patience and tenacity. I acquired more time managerial skills. It was a very fun work environment. The hardest part of the job is putting up the pinatas on the high shelves and not falling. I always enlisted the help of my co-workers.

good,I was an asm for Halloween city which is owned by party City. the management staff already knew me from running inventories for party City. Great place to work would definitely recommend.
good,Hours at party City were not given unless it was former staffing they were low on staff . They were nice and welcoming the application process was easy and quick  just didn't get as many hours as expected only got 5 hours a day two days a week
good,Party city is a fun place to work especially around Halloween time. At that time it is very fast pace but the worst part is the clean up at the end of each night.
good,A lot of hours due to Halloween and the co workers were nice and pretty cool but there were osme things that were messed up with inventory or with some of the machines not working.
good,"If you aren‚Äôt use to being around a lot of people or moving at a fast pace party city will train you for it, but it‚Äôs a great experience .. Iknow young kids are looking for jobs I think this will help them mature"
good,I learned different cultures all types of holidays that I didn‚Äôt celebrate and when they are and what they mean I had a great team here working at party city
good,on a typical day the days would start off slow and lead to a more increased speed allowing the associates to have more to do throughout the day. While there were times the days would feel long the joy of assisting people and getting more to do throughout the day made it feel shorter
good,"The work environment was very chill, fun & everyone there was extremely nice. Everyone there helped one another to get various tasks done quickly & effectively."
good,"Despite it only being for only a little while, I enjoyed my time at party city."
good,A regular day at the party is a lot of customers walking in confused and walking out happy. I help a lot of people out and the survey responses i get are marvelous. The management try to help everyone out as well. The hardest part of the job is try to help more than two customers at a time.
good,They were fair and strict and understanding a good place to work at we watch a video about how to work and teach each other and what we will do everyday

good,"I worked at Halloween City for only a short time but the staff I worked with was great and the products were always interesting and awesome."

good,"Party City was a fun, organized, exciting place to work. The work environment is inviting and friendly. The work schedule was too much for a high school student. A work/life balance was hard to maintain as a student."

good,"Overall, I liked working at Party City. A typical day at work was pretty slow-paced unless there was a major holiday coming up or there was a rush. Since it was my first job, I learned ,any basics that apply to most jobs. The management was flexible but strict as well. The most enjoyable part of the job was blowing up the balloon orders because it was so relaxing. There really wasn't a hard part of the job, everything was fairly easy."
good,"It was a temporary job for halloween, managers and work members helped me to be an effective worker being able to help the clients with efficiency and always make them happy about purchases."
good,"A workplace meant for those who just want to relax for most of the day, but it drags on...."
good,I am A very outgoing talented musician who like to do mechanic work. I Had a couple of jobs dealing with other peoples personalities so being flexable in the work field and finding other ways to handle difficult situations is something I take serious. The most I liked about the job was  that the surroundings I was in had lots of great people and we all worked together. I Didn't like I couldn't get more hours so I can get more money just because I had a lot of time. I am a great team member always trying to get the job done thank you for looking over my resume
good,The job was a great place to work. was nice enough to earn the customer service experience. we learned how to substitute items for parties and help customers find exactly what they were looking for or find something that is similar.
good,"Multi-tasking with several departments and communication a must.  To remain fluid to incoming freight, stocking, and customer service.  To be attentive to learning new products, safety measures, and keeping a positive shopping experience to those who arrive at the location."

good,"smooth productive days ,hardest part of the job was having to find where the small items belonged on the shelves, management was friendly and i never had any issues with anyone that worked there"
good,"A typical day at work includes organizing aisles and completing planograms while assisting customers. Management always encourage workers to do their best work and to follow their career dreams. The work culture is friendly as well as hard working. The hardest part of the job had to be mopping the entire store. The most enjoyable part of the job had to be helping customers plan baby showers, bridal showers, 1st birthdays, grad parties, prom, etc."
good,Party City was a great place to work. People were always there for a celebration of some sort. Sales  associates are there to help them have the best celebration ever.
good,Party city was probably one of the best jobs I ever had it was fine up beat and you are always ready to have a good time when you were there.  The pay was decent.
good,In a day you would work hands-on with many customers and get to learn many new selling techniques throughout your time. The management is all nice and they really want best for both customer and employee.
good,"I learned a lot but I had to work overtime to earn good pay. A typical day is very fun, I enjoyed every moment working for Party City, I just felt that with what I've accomplished with the company these past four years, I should have been getting better wages, But I definitely learned the managerial side of the business to a point that I boosted there profits on Halloween from 880,000 which was the projected number I had to reach, to 1.2 million, and company including the district manager was very happy with my efforts, but still didn't get no raise.."
good,Fast paced collaborative culture with great leadership.  Had a great time while at work but was stressful because of lack of staff and strict budget limitations.

good,Halloween City provides a fun and energetic work atmosphere. The hours were very flexible; the work was easy yet plentiful and allowed for a great deal of creative freedom.
good,"The company didn't promote from within, that is my only problem with them. They had a 47.5 hour work week and the overtime made the job worth the pay."

good,"it was cool Halloween, spooky scary, chill, fun, satueed, co workers discounts, money, store closed, lost job, on to better things now, lets get it, rip X"
good,"There are no typical set positions. I filled every position, including the responsibilities of the managers. At the end of the day, every job must be completed in order for the staff to be released. Thought the responsibilities are not difficult, it can become stressful during busy days. I learned to be relaxed in a stressful environment and give 110% through customer satisfaction during these times."

good,"Party City is a productive workplace, depending on the day/event, it can be slow pacing or busy. What I've leaned working in a retail store is to keep moving and don't stop, you have to be motivated and be able to manage being under stress and dealing with it, customers come first. Hardest part of the job is trying to please all the customers at once. The most enjoyable part about the job was getting through the day with no customers upset"
good,"Well, I had this job as a teenager (and that is honestly who the job is best suited for) and I am really grateful that it was my first job. The management aid you with the skills necessary for the job (and with working in general) so that you may hit the ground running."

good,I would come into work and look at the schedule to see what I would be doing for that day. I learned how to deal with customers and speak with respect. Management was very helpful with assisting me when needed and answering any questions I had as a first time employee. All co-workers were very friendly and helpful to me as well. The hardest part of the job for me personally was finding more things to do once I finished all of my tasks. The most enjoyable part of working at Party City was being able to come into work happy and enjoyed being at work and doing my job.
good,"I loved the job  and the atmosphere. What I enjoyed most was helping people plan parties and giving drink ideas. Management was fair and understanding. The hardest part about my job was always during Halloween, but it was also my favorite time due to thew fast pace atmosphere, and the fact I got to dress up."
good,Simple job and good work environment. The hardest part about the job was around halloween time when it got way busier than normal and needed to attend to multiple customers at a time.
good,Party City is a fun job to work for. Everyone is treated equally and the scheduling is amazing. Helping customers is amazing because you can help with their party planning and decorations. I will recommend this job for teenagers and Adults. The hard part about this job is that you get a short break.

good,The management was awesome. People were fun. I work here during the Halloween season and It was very stressful but rewarding at the same time. The only downfall was the go backs! Restocking was terrible.
good,Party City is a fun place to work for and most enjoyable. The management is very understanding. The most fun part about working at Party city would be the balloon station. Must be quick on your feet and stay organize. If you like being around little kids then this is a good job to work at. Would defiantly recommend this place for young teens.
good,I started as a junior in high school and worked part time while in college. It was a wonderful place to work. Management was amazing and taught me a lot about being in the workforce. I would highly recommend this company to someone for their 1st job or even as a part-time extra cash job.

good,"working here for 2 plus years has been enjoyable the managers are all cool for the most part as long as your doing what needs to be done pay is low and hours are flexible. daily work is easy just lots of customer survive. most of your day is at register, clean, or keeping inventory. sometimes you will have to carry some thing heavy vary rarely you may have to lift more than 60 pounds but will always have help. easy to pick up and learn on the job."
good,"This job was fun for me. I worked during the Halloween season and during this time I saw a lot of people, especially kids, excited for Halloween. The hardest part of this job was maintaining the sales floor clean and safe for customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers, helping them out with costumes, and seeing the creativity flow around in the costume area. I stocked merchandise in this job which required me to climb ladders and lift heavy merchandise."
good,A typical day would be very fast paste. Workers would assist customers and maintain the store to look as clean as possible for our customers. The management was very helpful in assisting workers with information on where a product is and what needs to be done in the store.

The most enjoyable part was being and the work atmosphere, also making things happen as a team."
good,Fun place to work at it's good for a starting job the most experience that is very good with this job is that they're willing to upgrade your pay they're willing to give you more hours and it is very cute to see the children coming in and ask for costumes you are more in-depth with customer service you can do more problem solving with customer service and also there is room to grow with this business
good,Always a good time working. Great staff and always works as a TEAM. Store manager (Lauren) did a great job shaping her Team into what they are today. Customer service is number one priority at this location and it shows.
good,Party city was a nive place to work it had good employees to work with the management was great in my opinion and everything was always expected to be in best shape
good,"My days at party city was good because Ima peoples person so I got a chance to interact with a lot of customers . some days were buys ,but it was great"
good,Party City provides Productive and Dynamic work environment. Many opportunity that force you to push yourself outside of your comfort zone and learn new things.
good,Didn't like the management at the Party City I had been employed at. They were kind of rude in my personal opinion. However the job is easy to do and as long as you stay on their good side you will be alright.
good,I was a fast pace workplace. Friday-Sunday were very busy with ballon orders. The management is good. They know what they're doing. It's a relatively fun place to work.
good,"Do morning paperwork, fax to home office, check balloon orders, get cash drawers ready, give employees daily task, check inventory, receive inventory, and handle customer complaints."
good,"Come to work,grab your radio and name tag and start to stack shelves or clean aisle's.Help customers and towards closing time,we start to clean the bathrooms or sweep.Then make sure all items are in the right aisle's and all aisle are in order and clean.Then go to the back room and turn off all radios and put back name tags and go home.I enjoyed talking to my co-workers."

good,"I enjoyed working at Halloween City, it easy and fun. Most importantly is to keep it clean. I've learn that you have to work fast and help others customers when they need help."
good,Party City was a good place to work. It is the busiest during the Halloween so most people got laid off after the season is over so job security is not that good.
good,"It's a nice place to work for, Halloween is the toughest time. You get to meet all kind of people and to watch the little ones face when they come in the store is the best. To help plan a party is fun."
good,"My job was seasonal; set up for Halloween season and then the tear down and removal of stores we built for the season. Enormous amount of travel, fast pace, work hard, good nights sleep. Smile what I was use to as a mason and in running my own business. I liked it. Jon"
good,"This was the funniest and goofiest job I have had. I loved every second of it, had a lot good laughs. The people who were there were very nice and hard working,"
good,Working at Party City for the month I was there was very enjoyable. I was able to help people pick out their Halloween Costume which was so much fun. The management was easy to work with and so were the other employees. I hate that this was a seasonal job.
good,Worked and pulled stock. loading and unloading freight trucks. Changed orders for online submissions. Organized all product on floor for sale. and worked retail.

good,"I liked working here, it was a fun environment and i really felt like i was helping the customers find what they needed. i "
good,"A typical day at work will consist of unloading boxes by departments, climbing up and down ladders to top and drop stock and engaging in excellent customer service. I've learned that i work best when working as a team. The managers are down to earth and are willing to help when needed. Becoming a Party City member is like joining a family. The hardest part of the job is trying to find something hard to do. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers."

good,Well managed location...i was treated with respect and I performed to the best of my ability. I highly recommend working for this organization without a doubt
good,Party City was a blast to work at. Except when Halloween is over and they fire a ton of staff. Other than that it's a fast paced but also easy going environment. It allows for people to work as a team and get stuff done.
good,"Your always busy, either at the counter or on the floor helping customers. Its a pretty big party place, they have so much you can choose from. The only thing that's not so great is when it comes to Halloween."
good,"Worked a seasonal position at this store. Overall it was a decent experience, however ""veteran employees"" would try to pass on their work to the temps so that they wouldn't have to do the work themselves. Obviously this was done when a manager was busy somewhere else."
good,"Slow during summer, most busy during weekends and holidays. Management also comes to help when busy or needed, fun place to work, friendly environment, family-oriented. Hardest part is when the work is too slow. The most enjoyable part of the job is during the big holidays such as Halloween. (Dressing up and helping others with their costumes and up-selling accessories)"
good,Party City treats its employee's as if they are family. The pay is nice and gets the bills paid. The managers are generally understanding of family circumstances and rather easy going and sociable.

good,Party City was a great place to work and learn alot about how restaurants work and the job culture is very supportive and quick paced. I loved working here and would work here again
good,Halloween City was awesome! Lots of costumes and people were always the happen there. Money wasn't short and I always felt wanted or needed by staff and employees.
good,The managers at party city are professional yet cool. They don't have any benefits and there are no pay raises is my only problem. You can't move up there. But they hire the right crew members.
good,Fun place to work. Some days can be slow with not much to do but stock in between customers. The only really busy time was during the Halloween costume season.
good,They hire very rare and usually only for seasonal. It's a fun environment with a huge focus on customer service. The managers are friendly and understanding.

good,"Work place was a great environment, employees were helpful and nice. A typical day at work started with counting my cash register and then stock inventory and when customers needed to checked out I would help them check out and then go back to stocking inventory or pricing items that didn't have a price tag on them."
good,great atmosphere. wonderful customer service. Great opportunity to work with a staff that is in sync. This was one of my favorite positions. seasonal but worth it.
good,Great place to work with a great team. Any issues were solved and no major workplace drama took place. Reasonable with hours and treated employees well
good,"Good workplace culture. typical saturdays are pretty busy a lot of balloon orders also during Halloween or holidays very busy. Overall nice job not stressful, easy going."
good,"Started working here in August to prepare for the Halloween rusg. Right away, the managers impressed me. Every day as I was leaving, my manager would compliment something I had done well that day, or would simply tell me I did a good job. Even on hard days when I knew I could have done better, it felt good to hear that. Plus the managers were really understanding and just wanted what was best for their employees. I got sick one day after a bad lunch and they allowed me to leave, even encouraged me to go so that I could recover. I felt like they actually cared about me."
good,to work in party city was fun active good environment management was so kind the put them self part of the team a day ends was crazy but fun when the holidays was in .

good,helped me out a lot with my customer service skills and retail sales skills. Was able to work in fast passed environment. They really acknowledge yours skills and help you display it.
good,It was fun the customers were nice and the managers are nice to a certain point. I lived a little far from the Store but walking there wasn't bad. If i could find another job it would be that store as a manager.
good,Really fun and fast paced job where you get to meet and interact with a variety of customers. can be somewhat overwhelming when the store is completely overflowing with customers.
good,This was a seasonal job and face paced.  It was during the busy time of the holiday season.  It required me to learn about the various merchandise sold in a short amount of time to provide great customer service.
good,The workers were awesome people. They were seasonal just like me  so we wouldn't be there long. That was fine with me. I needed a job for the holidays. This was a fun and great job to work for; just to interact with the kids and to see how excited to get their costumes . Also we got to dress up as well which was fun.
good,It was a good way to understand how retail works. Nice management. Typical days were slow but during the holidays it was very busy. Learned how to work an outdated cash register. There's always something in the wrong place at this store so there's always something to do. Most enjoyable part of the job was watching how excited the kids got when you blew up the balloons.
good,"Ok place to work"
good,"Worked here for a year while in college.  Good first job management was willing to work around my school schedule.  Was trained in several different aspects of the store from stock room, to cashier."
good,This is the best first-time job to be able to obtain! Very fun workplace  due to each Holiday being able to truly represent and show who you are with a costume dress up ON THE JOB! Work Life and school management are extremely do-able. Each manager on duty shares their true personality and is always available to help. Breaks are given during every shift in a timely manor with the opportunity to stay longer or pick up extra shift hours! Only con is that it is difficult to advance in this company with MINIMAL (basic 10 cents a year) pay raises and the most stressful time would be Halloween because it is around the clock and continuous importance to be available 24/7 and work maximum hours.
good,Very busy store but fun at the same time. This is a party store so you get to help customers plan parties and surprises. At the same time it is tiring because of the mess that you have to pick up at the end of the day.
good,This is a fun place to work if you like to help with parties. While workinf here I helped plan many parties and weddings. The customers are always so thankful.
good,receiving all items and matching to invoice. stocking items. learning the system. showed you how everything work and where everything goes. work great with each other. learning where everything goes. hallowing time. helping people with costume.
good,The place was fast paced and gave every employee something to do. There was always some sort of event depending on the holiday which was swell. The Cleanup procedure was really time-consuming if done alone but it was better when done with others. I learned how to use the cashier procedure even better and picked up some tips. The best thing about working with the company would be the People!
good,"Typical day at work, would just being attentive towards customers, finding certain costumes for satisfy the customers liking. furthered more in stocking and cashiering experience."
good,"I enjoyed seeing new people and helping customers find the costume that they were looking for.  Security was a little shaky, but everything else was fine even the hours."
good,Receiving stock and doing cash. I learned how to read a planogram. Management was awesome. Co-workers were very down to earth. Hardest part of the job was working outside in the cold receiving product. Most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the joy of children when they got what they needed.
good,"Working at party city for the Halloween season is a great experience because not only did it give me the chance to earn a couple extra dollars but it introduced me to some really amazing co workers, and if you enjoy the people you work with then going to work is always something to look forward too."
good,"I love being apart of this company, because it has taught me new skills. The most enjoyable part of my job is when a customer tells me I have great customer service."
good,"If you are looking for a fun, entertaining job that allows you to have a flexible safe place to work. this is the place for you. Who doesn't love to have fun and work at the same time?"
good,"Coworkers were nice and interview was easy, compensations was good considering lack of experience."
good,"They enjoyed my company. And they would love for me to come back whenever they rehire their seasonal employees. I learned how greet people better, help people when needed, and helped me become a better salesperson"
good,I like it here! The evnviornment is clean and nice I just think they need a new boss because this boss doesn't know what he is doing and doesn't know how to speak to people other than that I love it
good,"Very easy going, it was a good first time job. There wasn't very much hard work to do during normal seasons but when Halloween came around work became a bit more hard do to supply and demand."
good,"It was an enjoyable experience. Good managers, amazing associates, and a fun always changing environment. Great compensation. Opertunities for advancement."
good,You will deal with inventory and customers on a day to day basis. Management will be there to help you with both if help is needed and your co-workers will always be available to help if things get overwhelming
good,Working at party city was very interesting and fun due to meeting new people every minute of the day. Party city had this very welcoming and kind energy. The employees always put the customers first and kept the facility in top shape.

good,"Party City provided me with several different experiences that are applicable in future jobs. It taught me the proper and polite way to deal with customer, and answering questions for them that you may not be familiar with or are in your line of work. They also showed me how collaborative efforts can help achieve goals for the company much effectively and efficiently. Management and Coworkers made party city an amazing experience, everyone was nice and made me feel like i was at home. It was a fun experience all around getting to know everybody and not having to go through any difficulties throughout working there."
good,I had a blast working seasonal during halloween! its a fast paced work environment and you have to deal with people getting mad over not finding their size for their costumes but its not that bad.
good,"Fun, upbeat place to work! My co-workers were fun people, too bad this was just a seasonal job. Being a stock person here was busy, always on the go. Never a spare minutewhich made the time go by quickly."
good,This is not a job to work hard it gives you nothing in return. What you should do is play the game. What game is that its called the old boys game. How much you can suck up to the district manager so you can get that promotion.

good,"beginning of Week days busy with buying for both stores."
good,"Normally during Halloween season party stores are swamped with customers looking for different things. One day I'd be stocking shelves and hanging up props, other days I'd help customers look for costumes either for themselves or their children. I learned how to think on my feet and work at a fast place, assisting more than one customer at a time. Management was really fun and sometimes even brought in food for the employees out of their own pocket. The co-workers were, at first hard to understand and warm up to, but eventually after getting on the same page we came to an understanding. Being on your feet all day isn't for most people, but as long as you keep yourself busy the day will go by faster."
good,"On a typical day at work, there is a mellow vibe. You can see employees helping out customers, making sure that they are satisfied."
good,"A great experience, even though i was a finance i learned so many different aspect of company which was great. Many problems with many stores, high volume of issues"

good,Working at party city was honestly a good experience the people and the managers were all good people and the whole work environment was a good place to work
good,Working at this job was okay at first but then at times it wasn't for me but I still stayed there an manage to pull through. Working at a fast food restaurant you got to work fast because customers can order big meals or little meals an if you get they order wrong they will get mad.
good,interaction with customers was always a pleasure. coworkers always worked well together. managers were fair and helpful.
good,"Enjoyable work experience, pleasant management, fun coworkers, good place to work at when your going to school as well. Management helps work around busy school schedules."

good,I really enjoy this job. very good management and the co workers are very friendly and willing to help you and give tips. The most enjoyable part is when Halloween comes around and we can wear costumes and around that time would be the hardest time because the stores so busy we run bac and forth grabbing costumes or constantly helping people every minute of the hour.
good,"Responsibilities include tending to customers, handling freight, stocking the sales floor, and handling the balloon counter as well as the cash register. As a F.E.D, I make sure employees are following procedures, assisting customers, and completing their daily tasks.

good,"Counted money in the register, started blowing up the balloon orders for the day and then opened. Worked the register and helped customers find the perfect supplies for their party. Cleaned and maintained my work space. I learned how to multitask. Improved my teamwork skills. Luckily I had nice and friendly co-workers that would help.

good,"I assist customers with various decorations depending on what special occasion it is. A typical day at work includes, making sure all balloon bouquets are blown up and ready for pick at the accurate time customers have chosen. I enjoy working with my co-workers. Everyone is always professional and great when it comes to team work. The hardest part of my job I would have to say is, no matter how much you present great customer service, you just can't always please every customer. When it comes to the enjoyable part of work , I love working face to face with people, always going above and beyond to make sure the customers are always satisfied."

I would check customers out in an orderly, positive, fun manner. I would walk around the store greet, assist and help our customers with anything and everything they needed.  At the end of the day we would have to go through the entire store and ""face"" it.  This meant pulling all items forward so all spaces were filled and no holes were left behind."
good,"-Helping customers find what they are looking for and putting things away where they belong. "
good,"My typical day was to provide customer service and stocking merchandise."

good,"I enjoyed working at party city, especially on holidays like Halloween. everything about party city is cool work place."
good,"There was no such thing as a typical day at Party City. The environment changed all the time. I learned how to set plan- o- grams. I was part of the management team but it did start to fall apart. After the other team lead quit, there were two employees that got promoted to Team Lead, a female ( who took the other spot) and a male. I was demoted so that the male could be promoted. It was well known that the store manager did not like women in positions of authority. Shortly after I quit, the DM was reassigned and the GM was fired. Most of the coworkers were ok but some of them were quite lazy, seeing as how it was a party store, they felt the need to goof off a lot. The hardest party of my job was keeping up with the day to day responsibilities of running the store."
good,very upbeat fast pace enviroment to work in. Franchise owners expect 150% of your time
good,I like this job it was cool. They were willing to work with me when i went to school. Everyone liked me and I had no problems. The customers were cool.

He taught me how to do Shipping and Receiving, Ordering, Taking Wedding Invitation Orders, My Co-Workers where always fun to work with. Never a dull moment,"
good,"a typical days of work includes catching up on costumer returns, price adjustments, seasonal changes which means setting up planograms. Management is great, keeps the store running smooth and very understanding to costumer service issues. My co-workers are very helpful and team oriented. The hardest part about my job is just trying to find time to finish projects assigned for the day. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be seeing familiar faces day in and day out and being able to help them with what they are looking for."
good,"A typical day at work was also something to look forward to my co-workers were fun, out going and easy get along with. I found that the management was strict but not to the point where i as an employee felt uncomfortable arriving to work. I would have to say that hardest part of my job was dealing with the Halloween season the store become crowded and customers behind annoyed and would leave the store a disaster but at the end of it all i learned how to deal with excessive amounts of returns and working in a high paced environment.

good,"On any given day you have a lot of responsibilities at Party City. You could be the cashier, stocking shelves, in the back room, receiving, or out helping customers. I was holiday help for Halloween so my job mainly consisted of handling the immense rush of people looking for costumes every year. I learned how to deal with pretty much anyone socially at that job, you come into contact with just about everyone. My coworkers were all fun characters to work with, but they all got their work done. The hardest part was sometimes the people who come in are very rude and impatient but thats true of any retail job. The most enjoyable part though, was just the nice people who worked there."

They have taught me ways to work more efficiently and faster doing stock/ freight work, providing customer service, and expanding ideas on how to make Party City a more fun environment to work at. To keep professionalism in the company, I have gotten along with all present and previous co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customer's. I get along with the customer's and am glad to be able to help them with their event with the knowledge I have gained from Party City as well as my own creativity. I am always up for learning new things and having new experiences."

good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping customers find the specific product they came to the store location for and stocking up empty shelves."
good,I enjoyed most jobs as always management positions require lots of hours to earn your salary.  I have always enjoyed working with the public and the reward of making sales as well as mentoring others.
good,I liked the fact I can type up my resume and I can use it on here and I can look up jobs through this website and you give me lots of listings.
good,I liked working with my supervisor very nice and helpful also my co workers were nice lots of work but i always got the job done.
good,"Assisting customers with making purchases, answering phones, blowing up balloons, and customer service."
good,"I love coming to work day to day at Party City. A strong, vibrant, and fun environment. Working together with very strong employees we always made sure that every customer left satisfied. I've learned working at Party City that you must really take your time and get to know each customer before dealing and handling them.

good,I only worked at Party City for a short time. A typical day there was very busy. There was always something for me to do to keep me busy. I've learned how to deal with other types of personality and different people. The management team was okay it could've been better. My co-workers at the time were great. The hardest part was putting back all material. There was nothing I really enjoyed anything about the job.
good,"I was a team lead for Halloween City, and found much that needed improvement in terms of the higher staff. I learned how to balance my role as a leader, manager and role model for my staff, picking up the slack from the higher management. My co workers were mostly fantastic, and I only hit snags with one or two people. These were people who simply did not wish to do their work. The hardest part of the job was the initial rush. We weren't fully prepared to deal with it but quickly adapted. Overall, I enjoyed working for this company, and the enjoyed being able to design costumes and help people plan their events. I got to put my personal best skills in my work, and found my time here much more enjoyable."

good,The hardest part of this job I would have to say was remodeling the store for the next season.
good,"A typical day at work included stocking shelves, filling balloon orders for customers, and assisting customers with products. From time to time I would fulfill receiving duties on freight. I learned good customer service skills, as it was my first job. I learned how to deal with different types of product. The management was first class, always there to help you deal with a problem and always out there working and performing the same duties as their employees. My co-workers were fun and motivated to work. The hardest part of the job was setting planograms. I enjoyed everything about the job."
good,I was a cashier. I would clean the isles. Do go backs. blew up balloons and help customers create a party.

good,Working For Halloween City(Party City) was relaxed fun job to make extra money. Its fun communicating with the customers and hearing about all the different ideas on how people create their own unique costumes. As it gets closer to Halloween the busier it gets but still manageable. Over all relaxed job to work.
good,"For me it was very easy, after your interview it takes about 2 week to get a call back to see if you got the job and from there you learn the basics of the store like cash, floor associate then they will most likely keep you where you work best."
good,"My coworkers are like family, well managed, needing work in some areas like more payroll(which I'm sure is a common problem), but a great place to work at. Some customers are better than others but manageable. There's rarely a dull moment since there's always something that needs to be done."
good,It was an overall good experience. I had fun even if it was fot 2 months. I had to talk to costomers and stock up masks and shelves for Halloween. I can say that I would gladly go back if I wanted to.
good,My coworkers were fun people to work with . It‚Äôs an overall easy job and I would work there longer if i could but they job i did was only temporary for the halloween season .

good,It was alot of fun. There was pretty nice people. My manager was awesome. I made alot of friends. I meet alot of great people and their kids. I really miss working there.
good,"My typical day at work was store opening and closings. I performed store maintenance such as: cleaning bathrooms, checking maintenance room, coordinated stockroom organization. The hardest part of the job was register functions because there's a lot of retail scams and I'd have to make sure the customer wasn't scamming me."
good,"The job itself was a pretty good job, not too easy but not too hard. But the people there made it feel like I wasn't wanted and continuously said that me and the other new hire were not needed."

good,Work here was good in the part as to the management and fellow workers. The tasks required to perform were clear and allowed for good quality of work.
good,"I think it was a nice and chill place to work at. I learned how to use the cash register, put money away, scan items, etc. The management was good. the most enjoyable part was putting things back where they belong. the hardest part was using the tall ladders to carry the heavy costume boxes."
good,"I worked here for 7 months in the brand new coquitlam store. The mangagers are honestly the best I have ever had at any other work place. They are so nice and pretty responsible and train pretty well. As applying to a sales associate, I do about everything in the store. Clean, help people, stock. But the only bad thing was the way that the store schedules.  The online way is terrible. For example on friday i would check to see when i work, it would say i work saturday and not sunday. I check saturday and I WORK SUNDAY? Plans with family members have been interrupted many times but working here was definitely a joy!"
good,"Very fun I had a great experience working there, never really had any sort of issue with my peers or management, the work place was very up beat always bright never really a dull moment."

good,Great environment to work help each other but not enough overtime giving.great holiday pay good and quality trading that shows they care for there employee.
good,"Assisted customers with any questions or concerns."
good,"Party City keeps their workers very busy. If their are no customers waiting at the register or waiting to get their balloons filled, we have to clean, put ballons in the right cubby, and put things back on the shelves. They are friendly people and make everyone fill welcomed"
good,I enjoyed myself working there as being a sale associate and also blowing up balloons. On Friday and Saturday would be are busiest days when I use to work their.

good,I enjoyed working here. This job was very fair. Hours were great. Management was great as well. If I were still living in the area I would apply again for seasonal work.
good,"Depending on who you were working with because not everyone is hospitable like the store guidelines say. Despite how professional the staff can be, they need new supervisors. Some are intentionally rude and disrespectful"
good,"I've worked at Party City for nearly five years, and every time I quit for school or relocating I find myself coming back. The people I work with are always great and very fun. The environment of the store is fun and professional while remaining laid back. My biggest complaint has been with the general managers being too comfortable in the office and not pulling their weight, however my current manager is very different from this and actually cares about her work. "
good,"This was a truly fun place to work and often changed every year to keep ""fresh"". The biggest drawback was hiring and dealing with problem employees as there was a severe ""3 strikes"" policy that didn't really take into account the severity of the issue at hand."
good,"I worked there during Halloween and had fun in the fast-paced environment. My coworkers were nice, I had a lovely time working there. I really enjoyed working as a cashier, and I was a bit sad when I had to quit due to school."
good,"I loved working here. With many things to do, you were never just standing around aimlessly. I worked in the front, in the back during Halloween, at the balloon stand, and on the floor. Not only are there many things to do, the people i worked with were amazing and i miss them all dearly."
good,"I actually love working at party city. I‚Äôve been there since i was 16, they hired me with no experience. I‚Äôve moved all the way up to manager. It‚Äôs mostly just customer service skills, balloons, freight and recovery."
good,"Party City is a very competitive and stressful area to work in, considering it is retail. It's a good area to work in if one wishes to work their way upwards to management but getting there is very competitive from what I witnessed."
good,"Overall, this store was always fun to work at. As a member of management, I ensured that all our employees enjoyed working there. In general, we provided a great customer experience."
good,Halloween City is part of Party City in areas they don't have standard stores.  They are a pop up business that you build and Merch from the ground up and then sell costumes and decor up through Halloween.  Hours the first month(Sept) are somewhat scarce only enough to Merch and run the store as sales are light.  But October becomes a marathon and as long as your crew is a good team they do an amazing job.
good,Party City has been my favorite job so far. The people I worked with were really cool and my manager was very understanding. I got good hours for working part time and I even got a lunch with 4 hour shifts. They paid really well and I would honestly go back if I could.
good,"On the floor, helping out customers and also helped renovate a section of the store opening for Halloween. Strong problem solving skills, ensuring smooth operation of the organization / company. Managed all difficult customer service situations with tact and diplomacy."
good,I really like the managers and employees. Everyone was very helpful. I loved helping customers with their costume and party needs. Had lots of fun working here.
good,Crash course in Management.  Learned systems and procedures in 3 month period. Market manager and territory Manager gave positive feedback and provided excellent support.
good,"Everyday was always fun, managers there are pretty organized they are not telling you to do one thing and then do something else, they pretty much are all on the same page. Halloween gets a little crazy but it's fun."
good,"The Hialeah location is a high-volume store, because of this, we are constantly busy attending customers, doing plenty of balloon orders, stocking/fixing the store. It is a very productive job; rarely are you left not doing anything. The company is always switching up with the stores so we're always keeping up with what's new. "
good,I was a sales associate. I used to help people find the costume they wanted and help them find the best accessories to match their costumes. The most enjoyable part of this job were the people I used to work with.
good,"During the short time I spent at Halloween City, I had a pretty O.K time. As changing room attendant, I was given a lot of busy work along with supervising the work area and shoe wall near by. There were a few dull moments, as with any job, but for the most part I stayed on my toes."
good,Party city was a fun job as well as stressful depending on your position. Party city was fun because the company itself. You helped people with party.
good,"Working at party city was a great experience. It was my first job, and it was a great way to learn how to interact with customers. The store was oftentimes busy, especially on the weekends and during the halloween season, so that helped challenge me to learn how to work quickly but efficiently at the same time. The environment was good and I liked my co-workers, and it was overall a great experience working there. My favorite part of the job was helping customers, especially seeing them be pleasantly surprised of how easy and enjoyable their visit to the store could be with my help."
good,"I truly enjoyed working at Party city, the employees and management really helped my experience! They were extremely friendly and helpful, they made me feel like I was a part of a big family."
good,Schedule and management is great! Fun environment with great team associates. Associate positioning could be more reasonable with pay and responsibilities. Customer service is phenomenal.
good,"I was responsible for assisting customers, providing customer service, stocking, cleaning, and answering the telephone. I learned how to multitask very well. The workplace culture was acceptable. The hardest part of the job was sometimes being held accountable for more things than one can handle. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers."
good,If you want to be a manager so you never have to put stock out on the floor. This isn't the company for you. That being said the hours are good and the pay is fair for leadership and same for regular staff. Hoours on the other hand are only really good for managers. Seeing how they are the ones to reset new sections or change labels so to price changes. Everyone else is pretty much part time do to amount of hours given out to the stores.
good,"Within my five years with the company was great customer service experience. "
good,The pay isn't great.But the people who i met makes up for the time i spent here.Until I see my paycheck.It has it great moments of helping and advising guests about their parties.
good,"Working for Party City taught me how to multitask. Many customers came during the time I worked. I had to assistant almost all of them. I also had to clean the aisles with other workers, which was not hard if you knew where everything belonged."
good,This place is a very good place to work. The staff is very friendly. The hours are good. They are very flexible with their hours. The supervisors are very nice.
good,"Fun and easy job with excellent management.  Though I was not there long, I already had opportunities to advance in the company very quickly. Hard work here will benefit you"
good,This job is for high school students. The start rate is slightly higher than minimum wage. I enjoyed working here because they worked around my schedule. I enjoyed my co workers. There is always a overload of work but not enough people to do it. I worked her for almost four year. Halloween can be super fun but it can be overwhelming.
good,A typical day was helping customers find the items they needed and restocking items in the store. I learned how to multi-task since there were so many customers at once. Management was great and were very cool and nice people. The hardest part of the job was catering to every customers needs at the same time but it taught me a lot. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet all the cool people that worked alongside me during halloween.
good,"Working at party city was an enjoyable experience. There was no down time, especially as a manager. we constantly worked but also had fun working with colleagues. Everyday I would check inventory, check in on our employees to make sure they were all working, double check registers to confirm there was the right amount of cash,  provide excellent customer service, and clean the store every night to make sure it was presentable for the next day."
good,"Party City is a fun company to work for. The environment is a very rich and entertaining one at that, and the staff is very kind and productive."
good,"A typical day at work on weekdays is Calm, Peaceful and very Organized. Everyday was quite Repetitive for the most part, but managed to gain better Social and People Skills throughout the weekdays there.Management at Party City Corporation sought out to be pretty Organized to me. Co-workers all seemed to be really friendly and Cooperative with me. What i found the most Difficult task for me to complete was Re-Stocking all Monthly Freight that would come in depending on the Season of the time. Overall I found the job to be quite Beneficial to my Social Skills and Customer Services, I strongly believe the Job at Party City Corporation was most Enjoyable."
good,"I would get straight to work at either backroom service or the costume wall service. At the end of the shift I would leave or if I went until closing I would help with returns. The workplace was comfortable and it really helped me with time management and my communication skills. This was my first actual part time job, but I jut wish it wasn't on a seasonal based terms. My managers were all well organized, kind, and they all helped me with the different things I needed. The job gave me some really good amount of hours and experience. Almost all my co workers were cool and professional and they helped made the shifts more enjoyable. All my coworkers and I worked as a team and got through our shifts successfully. The hardest part was just the closing hours because of all the returns. The best part of the jobs was getting to convers and meet new people."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of counting tills from registers, closing out the safe, depositing cash, making change from the bank, assisting cashiers with difficult customers and making important decisions as a manager."
good,"My typical day at work was okay, we worked with our customers and make sure they were satisfied with their services, and then we would make sure our store was properly stocked and clean."
good,"They employees were nice, but the best part was interacting with the customers on a daily basis. I have no additional reviews to make at this time , thank you for the opportunity to voice my opinions."
good,"I have worked with Party City from 2011, in two different locations. My management, and even the corporate level, have all been very supportive. They are happy to answer questions and understanding when you have an issue you wish to discuss. I feel like I am a respected part of the team and that my voice is heard. Working here is fun and it's easy to keep yourself busy if you aren't lazy. These are the most flexible people I've ever worked with scheduling wise. I feel confident that even if I leave Party City for another job, I'll still be coming back for busy seasons and weekends. I'm sure I'll never completely leave."
good,"During the weeks before Halloween, we had to get the store ready which meant learning how to direct customers to the back of the store for costumes through an easy process. For the fact that most of my co-workers were seasonal part-time, they did not take the job as serious.The hardest part was cleaning the store after closing."
good,"I learned how to make balloon bouquets, work a cash register, inventory items, and great customer service skills. The managers were really understanding about many of things and were always willing to help if you didn't know. My co-workers always kept a smile on my face because there was never a dull moment. The hardest part of the job was during Halloween season the store would be packed with customers wanting to get costumes. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the great people I worked around and the team that we build because we got so close."
good,"I learned how to handle situations with other employees when they start to slack, also i became a leader when tasks were not completely finished. A typical day at work was pleasant and i was able to keep smiles on the customers who chose to ask me for help. I believe the hardest part about working at Party City was looking for costumes and/or equipment. The best part about work there was  dressing up for children and keeping a smile on their faces."
good,My overall experience working at Halloween City was good and lots of good people working around. Would recommend others to come next halloween season.
good,"A typical day is working freight, might get called for balloons, or may be on register. Hardest part of the day is mainly Saturday with balloon orders and walk-ins for balloons, nothing get's done."
good,The people that work at this corporation are very good people. typical day at work was blowing up balloons and dealing with customers
good,It was a really good experience and I enjoyed helping the kids find the costumes they wanted. The coworkers were great. Everyday I went to work after school and I enjoyed it.I always felt welcomed their.
good,fun place to work keep you socializing with your workers and also costumers working there was fun and I had learn a lot in my short time being there
good,"Party City was fun and of course it's busiest when it's May and June for graduating students and of course August up until Halloween. It depends on the location. Where I worked we had competition, there was a store around the corner that sold the some things we did but had better prices and more of a variety."
good,The day starts with clocking into the computer and going straight to work with helping the customers with finding the right items and costumes they need. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up but it got much easier as time went on. My co-workers and the management were friendly to talk to and get along with.
good,A typical day of work would start off with stocking merchandise checking inventory. Eventually i would assist with customers with any needs and ensure a satisfactory visit by checking them out on a designated register.
good,"Had fun working for them.  Applied back in September 2014.  Didn't get a call back till' mid-October.  The managers were nice and easy going, but unfortunately they forgot to send all my time sheets up to corporate, and I was not paid for all of my time worked.  Was promised to be a part of a cleanup team in November of that year, but they never called me.  Liked working there though.  Had fun helping customers.  Wish I worked there sooner, when it was still a dollar store back in 04'."
good,A typical day at work is basically the same day of when you first start. What I learn in this business is being able to do late night stock. My managers were all about their money. My coworker were very motivated. The hardest part of the job was the holiday month of Halloween. The most enjoyable part of the job was team work.
good,fun work days fun environment loved the coworker hand on meeting new people listening to music relax work place love my management team
good,"the workers where nice, Its a fast paced work environment and very clean."
good,A typical day at Party City on Monday-Friday we will restock the floor walls as well as restock the front of the house and the back. Since working at Party City I have learned retail skills and more customer service skills. Management I would say is good. There is always two or three mangers every work shift. My co-workers I would say are amazing people and making working more fun. We are like one be giant family trying to get things done in a timely matter. The thing I enjoy most about working at Party City is helping a customer find the product in which they are looking for as well has knowing I have made part of their day.
good,"This was an excellent job. I loved working in a Halloween store. It's my favorite holiday and the customers were awesome. My boss also bought us lunch and candy almost every day, so that was awesome and so nice."
good,"A typical day at work for party city on a seasonal hire for Halloween would be either being a cashier, and cleaning the front area of the store. I would also be put on cleaning to where I managed the down and over stock, and clean isles or helping costumers in obtaining costumes from the costume wall. I learned that there can be really uncooperative costumers and it is a lot of pressure during really busy days. management was good. they were all really polite and helpful when needed. My co-workers were fun people and friendly to everyone. The hardest part of the job was having to do a lot of things at once and having uncooperative costumers. The most enjoyable part is that I made new friends and obtained a working experience."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of filling balloon orders, greeting and assisting customers with any questions they had, and being energetic and always alert when the customer was ready to make a purchase or needed further assistance. I learned that even in stressful situations, you have to remain calm and make sure you always put the customer first."
good,"work friendly"
good,"This was a great job opportunity for seasonal work. I usually have a lull in my work around Halloween so this was a great way to have some extra income. Usually the store was fairly calm until the late afternoon which meant lots of time for cleaning and organizing the inventory. The hardest part of the job was probably getting adjusted to the opening and closing procedures, but even then it wasn't too much of a struggle because we were given a walk through guide to keep in the store."
good,"A typical day at Party City started on the cash register and answering the phones simultaneously. Assist customers with questions such as the location of products. closing at the end of the day was difficult at times because if all the ""Go backs"" which were products that the customers ended up not purchasing or items that were founded in the recovery stages through out the day. I worked though out Part City's busiest time of he year, Halloween. Therefore, the work load was lot heavier and difficult in some aspects but the management was very professional. My co-workers were a great help and provided support when needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was gaining confidence in working with the public. I now feel a lot more comfortable in high pressure situations which I can apply to the healthcare work force."
good,"I enjoy my job. A typical day of work includes helping customers, blowing up balloons, and being on the cash register. My most enjoyable moments at Party City are blowing up balloons and helping customers. I have learned better customer service skills and how to better interact with customers. Also, the job has taught me to be  more responsible and I have perfected how to multitask."
good,"A typical day consisted of coming in opening the store, reviewing the previous days paper work and bank deposit. I helped customers with costumes and sales, I fixed any problems that came to be in the store with customers or employees. My co-workers and I worked very well together, it was a great team environment. The hardest part of the job was loss prevention. The best part of the job was working with a great group of people and a great group of customers. It was a fun environment. I am sorry that the position is only temporary. I learned many things about customer service, working with a college students schedule, and a lot about creating a team environment."
good,Probably the best job I had. I did not like the sub managers as much and they led to me quitting. But it seems as though the issues have been fixed when I had visited last.
good,while i was working at party city i felt like part of a family instead of a team. the management was very caring and make working there enjoyable. the co workers make it a family as well almost like siblings. i remember one day i was at the register and not realizing i was singing i stumbled upon my managers watching me sing while i worked! i was so embarrassed but at the same time i was laughing and enjoying my time there. great experience.
good,Working at Halloween City has been a learning experience because it was my first job. Throughout the month I worked there I learn how to sort and put newly stock in its proper places. I learned to ticket the prices whether it was regular or discounted prices. The manager was confused most of the time and left most of her work to her assistant manager.
good,I loved working here. It was too bad that it was only for a month. I really enjoyed working here during the Halloween season. The kids and the parents were awesome!
good,I had fun volunteering to help out. I successfully helped customers and i felt proud and independent. I haven't learned much because i volunteered but i really should have just applied there.
good,Although I did not work there long. This was a good company to work for.
good,I have been working as a Halloween seasonal worker for two years now and love the experience.
good,I had a great time working there...We got to dresses up in our costumes.
good,"I liked working here. It felt like if it wasnt even a job! Management was awesome, super fun to work with. Hardest part, keeping the zones nice after customers. Most enjoyable part, the co-workers!"
good,"During Halloween, it would get very busy and many customers would get upset (especially because of our return policy of seasonal items). When you are cashier you check people out, answer the phone, and blow up balloons. After Halloween it was not as hectic, but there are still occasional rushes. I actually liked putting together balloon bouquets, and putting away new balloons was an easy and calm task."
good,There were days that we also had or good times laughing and enjoy ourselves. The bad only happened when things were getting out of hand at work . But so far we still came out with laughing and still smiling.
good,"i worked at party city as a seasonal associate, it was very busy and fast paced, the workers are all very friendly and nice, the managers as well. it is a good place to work if you need to take your mind off something, lots to think about on the job."
good,I dont have a review it was cool to work and ve apart of the party city team u work and learn as u help customers and others out I learned how its alright to learn from your mistakes.
good,"Once in the store, you would check in and grab a headset. Then the employee would go to the manager and ask if they would work on the floor or on the cash register. The day would proceed with cleaning a designated area and helping costumers that come. At some points, people who work at the front would help out the balloon stand. At the end of the day there is cleaning/sweeping the store."
good,I had a lot of fun working here. The managers were very friendly and helpful with my hectic schedule and any medical/health issues I encountered (I was pregnant at the time). My only problem was minimum wage pay. I was also able to plenty of hours.
good,"A typical day at work is easy, managing tasks and balloons could be difficult on certain days but overall good.  I learned good communication skills with customers. Management is good, salary could be raised."
good,I would clock in have the floor shift for half an hour and then I would have been shifted to cashier I enjoyed every hour I worked there I would work there again if I have the chance
good,Great and very uplifting environment to be in as well as good people to work with. Can become very chaotic during Halloween season due to the fact that it is the company's highest paying holiday.
good,"Good job, it all depends upon whether your store manager is strict or not. It‚Äôs really a hit or miss, it can be the funniest job of the worst job, I‚Äôve had a good experience."
good,"I wish party city paid better, I would gladly work there if the pay provided me enough income to pay bills easily.  The culture is the best I ever worked at."
good,"workforce at party city was both easy going and demanding, the crew trainers knew exactly what they were supposed to be doing and did a fantastic job of training new employees"
good,my aunt is general manager of the store was very happy to work along side of them also very professional atmosphere i also obtained many work hours here in the temp construction position i was employed in
good,Halloween city is a great business to the community.they don't discriminate and are nice to there customers.the easiest part of the job  was that everything they have you handle I light and easy to handle
good,All around a good job if it is around the busy seasons. Other than that it is pretty slow and a lot of walking around waiting for the next thing to do.
good,great for up to age 21 but the pay is not efficient for an adult with a family. but great for spare cash and teens.  fun environment during the holidays. super boring during the regular season.
good,When I was working there it was extremely fast paced and very tiring. A lot of running up and down stairs and back and forth between the back and the front. During the end of my time there it got so crazy there was no room to move in and out of the aisles.
good,I liked working here the only thing I didn‚Äôt like was getting paid minimum wage for a job that requires a lot of work during Halloween time amd holidays
good,"I learned a lot of retail experience how to stock products, inventory , face product, put out an end cap from scratch, how to do balloon bouquets, and a lot of customer service"
good,"Besides the pay, I loved working for Party City. It got stressful during halloween but your co-workers always made up for that. I believe management treated everyone fairly and was very accommodating for anything when scheduling."
good,"Everything was fun and fairly easy. The manager was nice, everyone is friendly and gets along well. Some customers can get a little rude, but it's not over the top."
good,start our mornings out with tons of coffee and a game plan for what products need to go out on the shelves. Everyone is always super friendly and helpful if you don't know where to start or how to do a task. Management is always very informative and willing to answer questions until you understand. During halloween time when i usually work is the best because I got to see the excitement of people coming in to choose their costume and asking for opinions as to what to pair for a Do it yourself costume. The hardest part of the job was lifting 60 pound boxes above my head while carrying them up the ladders.Most enjoyable part of the job was having amazing co workers and seeing all the party supplies and halloween decorations.
good,"I had a great time working for them. Store management was great. The higher ups weren't helpful when it came to questions. I had a blast helping kids and adults put together their costume, ideas for a costume and decorating ideas/tips."
good,This was my first job it honestly was relatively easy considering the fact it was seasonal during one of the busiest times of the year. You deal with customers non stop which is good for working on your customer service skills.
good,"I absolutely enjoyed going to work. The management was wonderful, and the staff was good at working together. The only downfall was that everyone worked part time."
good,"Any day at work included cleaning up the aisles, restocking, and helping customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the other employees.The hardest part of the job was trying to cooperate with difficult customers"
good,Good organized workplace during the busy seasons. They were very flexible and understanding with scheduling. It was an easy job once you get the hang of the layout of the store.
good,"Very enjoyable and fun workplace. Loved the staff that I got to work with and management was awesome. Steady work hours especially during big holidays, evening shifts typically end around 9:30 which is perfect. Overall, great experience!"
good,"worked stock and as a cashier. Management were friendly and approachable, and coworkers were easy to work with. lots of customer service, which was ultimately very rewarding."
good,"I worked for this company for about 8 years in 2 different states, the management team on both where great to work for, I started out as an Asst Manager in NC and after I moved to AZ i was rehired as a Asst Manager, but within a year I was moving up to a manager. Co workers where young but worked hard, the hardest part of this job was during Halloween season, long hours,"
good,"fast pace, high demand products"
good,"I loved the workers and the management, it was a wonderful place to work, an an easy job overall. The customers were always taken care of and shown much appreciation."
good,It's a good company to work with everybody is nice and calm the business is great. Working at party city is great we all work together to get things done.
good,It was fun except the fact that we where understaffed alot so you really had to be good at multitasking and remembering where everything went.
good,"team work, great communication, and they care about safety. Training our associates on customer service is very important."
good,"A typical day would be coming in and checking your work station. "
good,"It's a lively and fun place. Coworkers get along and help each other out. A typical day at work would be waiting for trucks to come in so I could unload the pallets of product. After that I would scan each box. Marking which ones were ok to be packed out by the team on the floor.Then I would go  over the P.O.'s to make sure we received everything. If not, mark the P.O. on which products are missing and file it to my manager. The hardest part of my job was backtracking months later for a discrepancy on the P.O.'s. The most enoyable part of my job was the customers. Helping them pick out costumes and making sure they had all the accessories."
good,"I started out as a seasonal hire for Halloween. I enjoyed this position a lot because I love the holiday. It was a bit hectic at times but our team was fantastic and we communicated clearly to get things done. I enjoyed working with my fellow coworkers and I was very fond of a few of the managers and supervisors. Overall a great company, the only downside was lack of clear communication with one particular supervisor which caused delays in work tasks."
good,"Halloween City was one of the most fun jobs I had. My coworkers were wonderful and the job itself wasn't hard. It was typical retail, but being a specialty store keep it from being boring."
good,"When daily deliveries are all checked in and worked out there is always more to be done. Store projects and assisting customers on sales floor a great way to stay active and enjoy each work day. Working the register has less can do since cannot leave register, but still has things can do to stay busy."
good,"As an associate for the company, it was quite fun and rewarding,"
good,i love party city managers were very helpful and its was a fun work place.
good,"Working at Party City has been great for giving me a taste of the work field."
good,"I only worked at party city for a short amount of time but it was a great experience, Although through my time working there, there was a lot of new managers coming and going so when ever i finally got comforable with one manager, a new one would come in and take over. I learned a lot and the only stressful thing about this job is Halloween season because it's non stop craziness."
good,"Love work in this company, because I like bring customer service and help other people."
good,i was always on time and learn how to do the register and i help cusomter and help them find thing on the floor
good,It was a very fun place to work at. Got to meet a lot of amazing people. Great experience.
good,i really liked working here only bad thing is that it was seasonal but one of the best jobs i had i would recommend anyone to work at one.
good,"Typical days consisted of customer service, managing associates and allocating task. This experience taught me a lot about how to gain the respect of associates while maintaing a boss to associate relationship. Management was extremely helpful in giving me the push I needed to become a successful manager. The most difficult part of the job was maintaining customer satisfaction, as a store with a no returns policy it is difficult to balance customer satisfaction with store policy. Most enjoyable were my co-workers, we were able to create a fun work environment while working hard and meeting goals."
good,"I liked it there, but I LOVE Halloween so I was in heaven!!! Despite that it was my first foray into retail and first as a GM, I think I did mostly alright. The employees were mostly a delight to work with and even my managers were a nice fun challenge to work with."
good,"I had a great experience, working for Party City. I felt like I really learned something there. It was my first job and it was great. The Managers were cool and made me work to my fullest"
good,The good thing about working at party city was unpacking and seeing so many different things and patterns also restocking the shelves . The bad thing about working there was the manager wasn‚Äôt on their job I was stuck doing one duty
good,"I grew alot with this company. I started when they were switching over to cooperate so that was a learning process, I very much enjoyed my job, I had an incredible team to help teach me the ropes. I became part of management and was able to test out new ideas in the store level for merchandising that went up the cooperate chain."
good,Great company to work for if you like a challenging fast paced environment. you will always have something to do. Halloween is the Christmas of Party City and Christmas season is slow so you can take off.
good,"If there's one thing that makes a wonderful working environment, it's the people you work with. Even if the day is going rough (i.e. tough customers, life issues, difficult projects), I have at least one co-worker to give me a hand; when one of us asks for assistance (extra help at the register or balloon counter, helping a customer with locating an item), there's almost an immediate response and someone making their way over to help. All of us care about how the store looks, so we all play our part with making the place presentable for everyone that visits our location. Our strong working relationship also makes the difficult seasons (Halloween and Graduation) more manageable and less chaotic. We're also not afraid to ask questions on how to perform specific tasks (especially if we feel like we're not doing it 100% correct) and we work together to take care of any suspicious characters that enter our location."
good,"I was a seasonal employee for Halloween. It was either fast or slow paced depending on your job for the day, but it was a good place to work with decent pay."
good,Great Place to work at! Staff is friendly! The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that there are no security bars at the entrance to keep thieves from stealing stuff from the store
good,"A typical day of work was the organization of the new products, great group work and every person has her or his area to organice. I learned how organice a area (because was Halloween) and all the motive was different. The workplace culture I loved, was very friendly and everybody help in the new area you were learning."
good,"I was hired there for the Halloween season, I was a cashier and it was very very easy to do, they would occasionally get busy like waves every 3-4 hours but overall not busy unless weekend for halloween or like special holidays. The management are so fun and I loved them a lot, they are very flexible with schedule but you do have to make sure someone can cover you or have to call in before a certain number of hours if you are taking off for any reason and easy with training the new people. The people who have worked there longer are use to people coming in and out for the holidays but they are all so nice! Very diverse place we have 30% discounts. Would recommend this as a side job but not good for a living seeing as I got paid $8 an hour with less than 20 hours a week maybe bout 12-18 a week. But hey you're barely doing any work so I think %8 is fair for what they have you do. Maybe they pay higher if you actually work there unseasonal. You clean aisles and organize them but very easy since everything is organized by a theme or color. I only give it a 4 star because the company that they use to pay you with have access to your money and YOU WILL see that your money is being used and taken from somewhere but it wont tell you what it is for, got multiple texts after not working there for a month about "" card declined for payment of ____ amount of money """
good,"Overall my work experience was great, everyone was so welcoming and easy to get along with. Hours were very good during Halloween hours also, relaxed environment but it can get really busy on Saturdays."
good,I enjoyed my time at party city.  I learned so much there.  Most fun was planograms and ordering. Balloons were fun as well. I became a fully functioning manager from my experience at party city.
good,Party City was by far one of the best places I've worked at. The atmosphere at this store was very uplifting and was another great place to work at. This store was very fast paced but was easy to adapt to. Would love to work at a store like Party City again.
good,I always have a awesome time at work and enjoy going into work. From day one the employees treated me with respect and like i've been part of the team for years.
good,"It was seriously a pretty chill job, getting to play with balloons and sweep the store was literally all I did. Sometimes you have to work freight and open boxes and stock the shelves,but honestly it's not that hard of a job."
good,"Management was supportive and encouraging, always made sure that I knew what was needed of me, and checked in to make sure if I needed help or any sort of assistance."
good,"This company is great for developing customer service skills as it is involved with the customers. You also get the chance to learn the basics of being a cashier/front-line worker. Lastly, this company also teaches you how to maintain and manage inventory and stock."
good,"Really enjoyed working there, Management was great and you always felt like part of the team. Had fun 90% of the time at work! Loved all the products sold there."

good,"I enjoyed this place of employment, it was a good first job. It was fast paced but it taught me a lot about customer service and how to be quick on my feet. I learned how to do things quickly with accuracy."
good,My experience at party city is a very great place to work and management is really great. I learned how to supervise the front where cashiers work. The hardest part of the job is when a customer is unsatisfied when we dont have a product cause we do are best to find something for them. The most enjoyable part of the job is you could have so much fun during shift. Every co-workers and managers are really great to meet.
good,"typical day at work consists of clocking in, getting straight to work either in the back or on the floor. I learned about how Party City stocked, managed the cash registers, and performed their assistants with customers and coworkers. I never worked with management. The workplace culture was a seasonal Halloween job, so it was very busy. However, the coworkers were friendly and nice."
good,"Always kept busy a lot of different and interesting thing to do. "
good,Every day at work is a new puzzle. Always keeping you on your toes and helping every customer as needed for the best shopping experience. This was my first job and management was very welcoming to teach me from day one what responsibility consists of and how to better yourself through your work. The Most enjoyable part of the job as a seasonal Halloween employee was the task of creating unique costumes and connecting with customers.
good,"my co-workers were the best they were fun , outgoing, enthusiastic the schedule was very flexible and can make more hours than expected.."
good,Had a great experience working at Party City. The staff and supervisors are very sincere and friendly. Though the store was somewhat disorganized with the way we stocked products at the end of the day it was overall a good day at work.
good,Being that party city is my first job I really enjoy working there. The hours are being cut and I'm in desperate need of another job. I love everyone there.
good,"At work you would be either blowing up balloons, stocking, or cashiering. You would also answer a question or two a customer has or answering the phone when it rung. Your coworkers and managers was always there to help you."
good,"Party city was a nice job to have - even though for me, it was only seasonal. They're a very understanding company, yet they maintain a serious work-first policy for all of their employees."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting & greeting customers!  I always greeted them with a smile and welcome!  Most people like it when they are recognized as they enter the store.  I enjoyed being the cashier...it came natural to me.  I liked keeping the area nice and clean and in order. Helping the customer was always a plus because the store had over 1 million items and it could be difficult to find something specific.  My co-workers were so kind and always helpful.  The one thing that I didn't like was blowing up balloons because, if they explode, the helium gets all over your face and clothes!  Management excelled at Party City!  They were driven by to be their best and they were great!"
good,I knew alot of co-workers so it was fun. The managers were cool always saying how a hard worker i was. The most enjoyable part of my jobs was meeting new poeple
good,Fun work place and supportive management. All task given can be easily done with proper training and learning experience. Co-workers are helpful giving tips to fellow workers and helping each other out when the amount of work task is overflowing
good,"Party City was a great place to work for.  The only reason I left was because of a back injury that occurred lifting a box of candy a few years ago at a company called iParty that Party City bought out.  The demanding company buyout put a lot of strain on my back in particular and caused more damage.  Aside from the physical injury the transition went smoothly and for my location at least it was a very profitable location with a black bottom line and gross margin hovering at 45%.  "
good,"Customer sevice, overnight Experience, Stocking, filling costom orders. Had a lot of fun working with the associates and managers."
good,"fun place to work, especially during busy times of the year."
good,"A day at work included Stocking shelves, Answering phone and placing orders, cashier and sanitization duties along with customer service. I learned how to understand computer programs to set schedules for customers while on the phone. As well as, inventory counts, provide returns with all types of payments, and assist consumers with questions, concerns, and complaints while maintaining a professional manor. All the employees and management were very nice and usually very helpful when I had a question. The hardest part of the job was the operations system which was out dated. This required a manager to stop what they were doing and walk up to the front to type in multiple passwords and restart they systems. This made the job a bit challenging but it was nothing we could not handle. The most enjoyable part of this job was making everyone smile as I helped them pick out their favorite colors and characters for weddings, birthdays and more."
good,A typical day at work at Party City overall was exciting. The seasonal department was always changing and my co workers were pleasant to work with. I believe the hardest part of the job was our Halloween season due to the fact of the customers you had to please at once and making sure that everyone had a good shopping experience.
good,"Spent most of the time at the cashier, would occasionally downstock."
good,"I've been working at Party City for about 2 weeks as a seasonal employee, the atmosphere is nice and the employees are great and helpful."
good,"A typical day at my job would when i get to work i go put my purse into my locker and then go clock in and grab a walkie talkie and ask my manager what my task for that day is. most of the time my task is recovery since i mostly do closing shifts so from 5pm- 8:30-9 when we close i recover the entire store, along the way i also assist customers if they need help and ask them if there is anything i can help them with. what i learned was that working retail you are always moving and doing something you cant stand around if you are standing around your not working hard enough because there is always a customer that may need help or something to be cleaned or restalked. The management at Party city i am able to work with and am able to go to if i have a concern or question they act like a management team. The hardest Part of my job would be having to restalk merchandise on the top shelf because i have to use a ladder and the ladders we have are the ones with wheels and since i am so petite it moves even when i am standing on the top of it. The most enjoyable part i would say is when i see little kids and they look so happy when they come into the store and they leave even happier."
good,Party city is a fun place to work for. Meeting new people is always a plus.
good,"I was only a seasonal employee for Halloween but still I loved every minute of it. It was a very fast pace job, we were always moving. The coworkers treat you like family and keep you comfortable so the work moves quick. Most of the managers were very nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job was mainly keeping up with the customers requests and not having them wait too long to get what they needed. The part I loved most about the job was seeing the smiles on the customers faces when they found what they were looking for."
good,"Good with working around your school schedule. Co-workers are friendly, a typical 30min break for your break. All in all good experience."
good,"I loved working at Party City. All the managers were extremely friendly and welcoming. At party city, I had to help customers find costumes for Halloween, I also had to work in the back room an find the costumes for the customers as well. I love people so i enjoyed working on the floor a lot more. I also had to face the shelves, make sure all isles were clean."

good,Managers are great. Easy job for teenagers and collage kids it‚Äôs better than fast food restaurants that‚Äôs for sure. I love seeing how much people really put into partys
good,I loved it. My coworkers were very kind and enjoyable to be around. The hardest part is just standing behind the register. I enjoyed working the register and talking with customers.
good,Took awhile to pick up on the pace but I was able to manage it because at the time I was in high school. I was also participating in sport (Track) at McKinney High School. The manager at party city was understanding and had a son who was in the same shoes.
good,"Working at party city was a well balanced experience for me. I worked during October and my job description was seasonal. So, yes you can imagine that around that time working there could get pretty stressful, but it was never overbearing. Management was nice and we're actually pretty human. Not your typical ""mean"" boss. But, very assertive and humorous."
good,I love this job and people was friendly  and funny and very respectful place to work.. I like the Jackson b I just wish they stay open for along time but they closed down. Yep

good,"I began my experience with Party City as a customer. I am a huge Halloween fan and love planning parties. I started as a cashier and I had very good training by some wonderful people. I learned quickly and they rewarded my efforts with a promotion. I learned to inflate 100+ balloons in a short amount of time as well as how to make beautiful bouquets of balloons. I loved working with customers and helping them make key decisions or even minor ones when it came to their party and costume needs. Due to the constant change of General Managers, we had a need for Team Leaders and I was chosen next to be promoted. I learned many managers tasks and how to manage coworkers effectively in stressful situations. This job is great despite the multiple general managers who had conflicting methods of management."
good,"I personally learned a lot working there building something from the ground up, I was constantly competing with myself by accomplishing goal after goal."
good,"‚Ä¢	Assisted customers with costume pick up, orders and purchases."
good,A typical day at work was when I clock in and help customers. What ive learned in my job how to interact with customers when they need help or ask  questions. The management was pretty fair. The Co worrkers was really nice an easy going they are fun to work with. The hardest part of my job is when it was Holloween season an when i have to deal with multiple customers at the same time but i made them happy once they walked out of the store. the most enjoyable part of my job was when i meet different kind of people.
good,I loved working there but it was only seasonal . I love interacting with customers and my employees there . It was an great experience working there because I met a lot of new people and learned how to corporate with others more
good,"Working with new people every day and learning how to blow up balloons. And I learned how to stock and, look for stuff in the back. I learn how to work with mask"

good,I loved working there .. seasonal job only customer service Halloween season on time respectful caring clean sales associate fast learner helpful strong fun job
good,"Come in and start the cash register up for the morning report and head to the office so i can start the counts and then do the deposit and set- up the cash drawers for the day. then i read the store managers notes to see what on the agenda for the day. then as the crew comes in i delegate whats needs to be do for the and get to work. As the day goes by i make sure that all balloon orders are do on time and stay on the online orders are done also, but in between that ihave to provide customer service at a high quality, then i also have to brief the next manager on whats going on for the day."
good,"i liked the people i worked with. i was miserable though, only because i was in pain almost everyday. If i wasn't in pain everyday i would of loved it."
good,Nice place to learn if you are looking for experience within the work force this place is a great place to start it‚Äôs so fun to work here during the seasons specially Halloween
good,"Excellent job environment, good management, "
good,"While i work at halloween city , i explored different personalities, i enjoy talking to the customers & providing them help without a problem. i appreciate halloween city for giving me my first job & my time there was very productive & i enjoyed my first experience, it would be hard to imagine working in a brand new environment but i got to do what i got to do."
good,"- busy, friendly staff"
good,"i enjoyed working for the company because it was a fun place to work, most enjoyable and important part of the job was meeting new people and employees.making the customers and their kids happy and seeing the smiles on everyone's faces from old to young! and most of all getting to be a kid again."
good,"A typical day at Party City , i would come in to work and clock in , i would look around the store to see if anything needs stocked or fixed. Then i would help customers find the right costumes that they needed or anything they needed around the store. Next i would go to cashier and ring out the costumer. At the end of the day i would clean the store down."
good,A typical day at work is as soon as you get there you check is make sure you everything is in stock for the day. Make sure all the tables are cleaned. Taking all orders and answering the phones. Making sure the waiters are not too overwhelmed with their customers and the best part is being able to interact wit so many people and the dancing and laid back vibe.
good,I worked as a seasonal employee for Party City and loved it! I'm a very creative and hands on person and loved being able to help customers turn their costumes into characters. I oddly loved spinning the sign out on the side of the street as well!
good,"I would come into work and things that were not put away correct, I would then go to fill the shelves with the things on the floor and place new things out. We passed out costumes as well."
good,Party city was an awesome job just not enough hours and the pay sucks..your fingers hurt from doing balloons and they don't give u enough hours to live off of
good,really loved working there i liked how their aisles where divided by zones and tht i had my own zone unfortunatly i had a conflict of interest
good,"A typical day at work is working the registers and interacting with diverse people ."
good,Overall party city was a good experience for me. I was straight out of highschool and it was my first job. I was seasonal and I worked hard to prove I can work regularly and I did. It‚Äôs fun and you have to be very creative and festive.
good,"Just a really good place to be, but only if you don't mind standing for hours with no customers coming in once in a while. The management is good as well but won't work to much with your schedule."
good,"Amazing atmosphere for high school students to get great customer service experience! I started when i was 15 years old, and it was great."
good,"Volunteered making customers happy, fulfilling balloon orders, assisting them in finding products."
good,"While working at Party City I've learned great customer, how to work a register, communicate with others and work as a team.  The most enjoyable part of the job is having the customer leave satisfied and happy. The hardest part of the hob is the hours.  Working here you have to be comfortable with kids of all ages and always be in a positive mood."
good,Good job for a teenager wanting to earn some easy money. Flexible hours and a lot of fun.
good,Manager was leniant and understand but she often said things to me one way but wanted it to happen another way.  This caused conflict between her staff.
good,"It was overall an easy job, it got difficult around Halloween and the weekends when everyone wanted to throw a party but not too stressful. I loved my job, and the flexibility with school made it easier"
good,"Party is is pretty laid back for a work environment. It can be a fun place. They aren't very willing to work with time off request.  IT can be fast paced during the holidays,"
good,"A great team spirited place to work. The employees and management are very understanding, The hardest part about working for party city is the multi tasking."
good,"*management changed a lot"
good,"ÔÇß Responsible for managing all business operations for this fast-paced, party goods retail facility including supervising, training and scheduling up to fifteen employees in accordance with company‚Äôs policies and procedures."
good,"They have good work flow, but bad teamwork. Managers hardly ever leave the office, and get angry when you call for them. I would say this job is more for a college student who doesn't have to pay regular bills."
good,"It was a fun job and fairly simple, but the manager never did any of her own work. She overwhelmed everyone with tasks they were not paid to do. The manager at a different location was amazing though! Great job!"
good,"Party city is a very fun, upbeat work place. willing to teach you the ropes as long as you are willing to learn. very fast pace around Halloween time, but fun."
good,"Great job to work for, I got a lot of retail experience, specially the importance of knowing about store products, which then helps you give better customer service."
good,". constantly moving "
good,"I learned a lot at party city. I received 2 promotions in my year there, starting at a regular sales associate doing typical cashier duties, putting stock away and recovering the store to the next step as a front end supervisor during the busy halloween season, which brought on more responsibilities like authorizing returns and discounts and directing staff on where they are needed. and the final promotion to a team lead where I was an opening and closing manager, took care of counting the tills and making float, printing and implementing reports and managing a team of about 5 staff regularly. during my time here I partook in additional work like relaying the store (big display flips), inventory, and also was asked to go to other Party City locations in Ontario that were not up to standards and helped them reach the desired potential."
good,"Some aspects of the job were stressful and difficult but I handled it by working and trying to learn quickly. Dealing with customers sometimes proved to be diffiicult, but when things got tough I was able to get help from management."
good,"it was fun to work there, was only seasonal but saw enough to know that the managers were rude and did not care for the employees ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
good,I was only working for seasonal at the Party City. But I thought I was gonna stay there for good. Till I called my manager and he said that was it it was seasonal.
good,"This was a seasonal position for me two years in a row. I absolutely loved working in the store during the Halloween season/holiday. It was a blast, I even stood by the road in a clown suit- and loved it!"
good,"This honestly depends which one you work at. Some of them are really nice with great management some aren‚Äôt. The first one I worked at was great, I actually had fun at my job. The second locations was horrible and management treated us that way. Just depends which work environment you‚Äôre at and more comfortable with."
good,"Overall, I loved working at Party City. It's a fun, fast pace but yet laid back job. I enjoyed helping the customers and offering ideas for party themes/items."
good,Good place to work enjoyed the environment and people I worked with especially fun during holiday seasons such as Halloween and very relaxed as far as looks of employees
good,"I enjoyed this job for the most part. During my time there, majority of my coworkers were close in age to myself, with the exception of management. It was fast paced but pretty laid back. There was always something to do especially around the holiday season."
good,Most enjoyable part of this was the co-workers and customers I dealt with. I enjoyed working as a team. I learned how to manage time better and I learned the process of stocking merchandise.
good,the way that workers greet customers when they first step in the store is truly exceptional. the music really centers the mood of the customer because it is not boring or lame but good and smooth
good,The boss was awesome and the hours were super flexible. If you wanted to work you could. Wasn't strict. Felt more like a summer project rather than a job.
good,Work was very easy just had to either get costumes in the back for the customers or take the orders from the customers so who ever is in the back can get them out for them. Management was very helpful with working around schedules and you got chances to build your interpersonal skills by having to talk to people.
good,"the hardest part was the end of the day when we were getting ready to leave because we had to restock and clean the whole store. i am not complaining it was just hard, but i did not have a problem doing it. i enjoyed the crew i worked with each and everyday."
good,My time at Party City was an enjoyable one with all the season changing and the store as well it left something to look forward to but the lack of pay and benefits is the reason I wouldn't stay there more than 2 years.
good,"Great Company that has a great store and area , the customers are really nice & doesn't give no complains at all. Positive energy with great mind sets at party city , Fun and productive to work there."
good,"I helped customers find what they were looking for."
good,A typical day at work is operate the register and assist customers. I didn't learn too muck because I was only there one month due to a temporary position. The manager there was very professional and handled his job well. My co-workers were fun and energetic. The most frustrating part was cleaning up all those costumes. The most joyable part was seeing customers in different kinds of costumes.
good,"The place was a fun enviroment,my shifts wouldnt start until 10pm as I was a 3rd shift employee so I would spend the entire night stocking whatever we got in during the day time and occasionally unloading trucks in the morning before my shift ended"
good,"Cashier, sales, customer service, stocking shelves, balloon counter."
good,If you like Halloween then Party City is an awesome way to make money during the holiday season. I loved being a curbside character the most because I would put my headphones on and dance all day at the street curb.
good,"The Place Is Great, The People Are Great But The Pay Is Terrible And Definitely Not Worth The Trouble, This Kind Of Job Is For Teens Who Have No Bills To Pay What So Ever, Because You Wont Be Left With Much Working Here."
good,"Work was great, it was a really easy going job, the boss was great, he was always understanding and accommodating to any personal matters that would come up."
good,It was seasonal. I only work seasonal there the needed someone for the Halloween season. It was fun and but busy too but it was ok. I was a cashier and a stocker. I learn a lot from part city I learn how to handle money by being a cashier and stocking items from them too.
good,"Basic customer service skills, ability to branch out to register/floor/stock. team effort. Use your own personal advice for parties/ holiday decor/ balloons and Halloween contuses/ accessories."
good,the most enjoyable was watching kids faces with getting a costume for Halloween. learning how to blow up balloons and getting a discount for my grandson birthday party
good,"I worked cash register and greeted costumers as they entered the store."
good,"While employed at Party City a typical day would consist of the organization and inflation of balloons. "
good,"Co- workers are very nice. During the Halloween season, time will go by very fast because of how busy the store is. Managers are nice and flexible with scheduling. The hardest part of the day is when you are assigned to recover items that other customers misplaced."
good,It was a pretty good first job that I have had although for art time workers I do think they should have benefits if they have us working like here fulltime.
good,I was there through the Halloween season and it was my job to help the customers pick out and get the right size costumes. It was a lot of fun and something I'll never forget.
good,"If I opened I would show up to work early set up my register, clean the front windows and doors. Begin filling any balloon orders that needed to be completed. I would check out customers, assist them in finding items. I would stock shelves when not at the register. If I worked the night shift I would unload freight and put it out on the shelves, and customer service. After closing we were assigned cleaning duties depending on what they were I would have to either sweep, take out garbage or clean the bathroom. Management was very nice and understanding. They were always there if something needed attention. I enjoyed working with my co workers they would make the day go by faster and were a joy to be around. The hardest part is when freight was heavy and I would need to climb up and down a ladder putting overstock away. I would have to say the most enjoyable part was when I was put on the balloon counter since all I would do is assist customers and fill balloon orders, but when there was no orders we would still have to stock shelves or freight."
good,Was laid off during their Halloween season after working for a year.
good,Lots of fun working here. Helping customers pick out their costumes was the best part.
good,I love working at Party City lots of fun great people but i had to star a new life out of H.S and need it more money
good,Good for a teen job just starting out. No growth opportunity though. So it‚Äôs not a place to feel as though you‚Äôre going to be there forever. Only seasonal.
good,Working there wasn‚Äôt bad I had a great time and helping children and working as a team. Although I wish the job didn‚Äôt end so quick I also gained more experience.
good,"All The Customers That Needed Help I Assisted Them With No Problem, I Received And Gave Change To Customers I Organized The Costumes And Made Sure All Costumes were Accounted Foreign"

good,"flexible working hours "
good,My day of the job was good and busy.  I learned how to make sure customers are happy when they come in and when they leave.  Management could have been better!
good,Working at party city was a great experience for me because I got to learn how to deal with customers needs and I also got to learn how to organize and maintain my own area
good,You have to be prepared to work hard and be busy! This place gets packed with kids and families for the Halloween season. You have to be detail orientated with lots of patience!
good,The work environment was wonderful. I loved the people I worked with and my managers as well. The hours were great and communication was great. I loved the job
good,Beginning of my day would start with cleaning the front store windows.I would next begin the ballon orders that were needed to be done on that day. Even when busy with customers the environment seems relaxed and not stressed. This is one thing that allowed me to stay for the company even though the pay wasn't ok.
good,"always on the go , nice staff , nice customers everyone is friends so its easy to get along and have fun while working and stocking shelves etc and filling"
good,"I loved my job at party city, sadly the position was only temporary. The job included watching the costume wall, retrieving orders and cleaning up the store when we closed. It was a fun job and I‚Äôd love to have another job in customer service or retail."
good,I really enjoyed working for party city.  I worked decent shifts and got to know the entire store and where everything was very quickly. Had fun working the costume wall.
good,Great place to work with respectful staff and management. Very flexible with hours and scheduling. Working there taught me a lot about organization by making everything look nice and presentable.
good,"At work, I would be assisting costumers with whatever they were looking for. I mostly kept the aisles clean and placed costumes or products where they were supposed to be. I was also learning how to use a cash register."
good,At party city the biggest thing ive learned is how important it is to have patience. Especially during balloon rushes. Which were my favorite part of the job. Saturday Mornings When Everyone is up Alive and working as a team the day just flows smoothly aside from the rush but being able to work alongside the wonderful people there just makes it so much better!
good,"Easy job, goo job, good pay on Halloween, fun and no complaints I learned a lot and I love the management and employees and recommend this new workers"

good,"The weekends and graduation time were my favorite times because a lot of people visit the store and a great amount of balloons are purchased."
good,Employees and management were great to work with. Enjoyed the customer service aspect of the job and the company goals for customer satisfaction. Loved my time there.
good,Come to work and began preping for customers very organized store the staff was very helpful to each other there and friendly the manager was a great guy treated me well. The hardest part of the job was going home at the end of the day and when the season ended.

good,"Halloween city and toy city fun to work. Experience different type of customer service, recommend different items fitting rooms and cash register. Stock, price tag items"
good,Halloween  ity is a great company to work for. Being a sales associate is not like any other sales job. You're helping people find themselves through a character they didn't know they could celebrate as until you help them find that character.
good,"It was a fun place to work with great people, but it was for the Halloween season only. They did offer to bring me back the following year , but I had a conflict."

good,Party city is a great place to work at they have fun and its so easy to learn the system and it fun to deal with the customers when especially halloween comes around
good,I liked working for party city. to bad it was only temporary. helping people find costumes and accessories to go with there costume. very productive and very friendly
good,"I honestly enjoyed working here. The people i worked with were wonderful, the only reason I couldn‚Äôt stay is because of differences with the manager. I would recommend working at party city if you just need a little extra money or if you‚Äôre looking for a manager position."
good,Party city was a start of teaching me to work in different areas such as cashier and sale associate. it Helped me learn and achieve new goals that I am  willing to work in any environment
good,for a seasonal job and my first job it was great. the environment was fantastic and i enjoyed the short time i worked here. the management was also really good.
good,"Not really a place to make a career, better for high school kids or college students. But It was fun mostly laid back, except around Halloween when it would get insane. Very fast paced and crowded"
good,"one  thing that was hard for me to do was try to control crazy days at dollarama, people running around and children making messes but one thing i learned from that was to try and take control of the situation in a respectful manner."
good,Fast pace working environment. Learned how to work well with others. Most enjoyable part of the job was assisting the customers with selecting items for parties.
good,"For anyone who loves Halloween it is a great place to be. Don't expect to get off easy though, you'll spend your whole time stocking, cleaning the dressing rooms, repackaging items, or helping customers. Despite being constantly busy it is really fun. I wish I could do it year round."
good,"Would recommend this job as it was also my favorite Holiday. Wish the Seasonal job had lasted at least until after all the Holidays. Until after Christmas, but it wasn't that kind of store."
good,"If only the job was year round, work load was nicely divided, teamwork and communication was a key focus, it was overall just an amazing place to work."
good,"Working there was really fun, everyone was cool with each other and the manager was really nice. It got really hectic with Halloween season but other than that it was good."

Not only do we get to dress up and have a blast, but for me, I enjoy seeing the looks  on the faces of the families and children that come in to do their seasonal shopping. They make the holidays better when we have what they need and they are satisfied. An average day is completing my candy and balloon orders and making sure that everything runs smooth. I have learned how to manage a larger staff and how to handle different situations with customers. We are a family so it makes things easy when one needs a helping hand. Visual Merchandising is a personal favorite. Every time we turn around we are setting up for the next holiday or event coming up. I love doing floorsets, planograms and displays. The hardest part of the day would have to be when the delivery drivers cannot fit into our dock and we have to unload 15 pallets by hand in 98 degree weather (which really only happens when getting ready for Halloween). When you enjoy your job, much doesnt make it hard to work there."
good,"I did multiple little jobs when I was hired at Party city. One day I would work the costume wall , and the next day I was in the back room retrieved costumes. The main goal was to retrieve costumes quickly and when I was out on the floor the main goal was to sell as many accessories."
good,"-most days very busy with customer orders."
good,Everybody gets alone. If you walk in sad you will be happy by the end of the day. I love to help people find what they need and keep a conversation. My co - workers are always there if I'm not feeling good and let me know if I'm not doing something right. The hardest part of the job is keeping the customer happy. If you don't have it they get real mad. For example it was my 3rd day working and i had a customer asking if we had something he wanted. I checked to make sure we don't have it and ask my manager. When I told him we don't have it and showed him some things similar. He got mad and started calling me names. I didn't get mad. I kept a smile on my face and stayed polite and got my manager to deal with him. The most enjoyable part of the job is i can be my self and have fun with customers and my Co- workers and manager. It's like we a big happy family.
good,Learned to manage temporary and long term help. A typical day included unloading a semi truck of merchandise and fixtures for a store and assembling in one day. The most difficult part of the job was the travel. My co-workers were knowledgeable yet also eager to learn. The best part of this experience was seeing each store completed and seeing the regional and local management satisfied and even excited about the appearance of their retail store.
good,"This was my first time being an Assistant Manager. I absolutely loved it. I struggled at first and had many responsibilities all at once, but I soon learned how to multi task and work in a fast paced environment. I was a great leader and team player.  "

good,"A typical work day is clocking in and stocking shelves, rining out customers. what i learned is how to enter act with people and all types of personality.

good,fun meeting new people customer service was great
good,a typical day at work is walk in and help the customer pick out their Halloween costumes and help them with anything else they needed. I learned that no matter what day you start out with it can get better and it feels good helping people and making them happy. my co-workers helped me with anything when I first started working at Party City. the hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. the best part of the job was putting a wig or some kind of accesory on to help sell the acccessories as much as the costumes and everything else in the store.

good,Trabajo en equipo es perfecto y mucha alegria y simpat√≠a
good,"I loved working at Party City. I worked there during the Halloween season so our manager allowed us to wear costumes and accessories to help promote sales and also to have fun while working. We were allowed to have fun with our work such as joking with other co-workers and conversating and such, so long as it didn't affect our work of course. It was really great as well to see the kids try on their costumes and leave happy and cheerful when they got their favorite superhero or cartoon character. I'd love to work there again if the opportunity ever rose."
good,Made lots of great friends at the company. The organization was very great at allowing me time to go to school and return to work. Whenever there was downtime there were lots of different tasks to do at all levels of employment. Manager was great about making the schedule around family events and appointments.

good,"I very much enjoyed working at Party City. Even though it is a retail job and there were sometimes very rude and hostile customers that came in, thee job itself was very simple and enjoyable."
good,"Not too involved, management had realistic expectations. Fine for a high school student or a college student looking for some extra short term money; not really a career."
good,"Manager is terrific and so are the other employees. Extremely fun place to work and a great company to be a part of. When first starting it can seem a little hectic, but you pick it up fairly quickly. Can be very fast paced at times, whereas it can also be extremely slow at times. It‚Äôs a Good paying job and I would probably even work for less than I make jus cause of how fun it is to work there."
good,"a typical day at work was cleaning the areas, keeping the line short, having people bring costumes to the front, it was always packed, learned to be fast on the register, management was great very friendly so were coworker reason why my job was so enjoyable. the hardest part would be cleaning once we closed."
good,"For a seasonal type job this was by far the best! The atmosphere was fun and laid back, though it did have its moments where it was all business! Coworkers were really friendly and the hours were very flexible! I totally recommend this as a seasonal job to make extra cash!"
good,"Even though job is temporary and seasonal, it is a great place to work. The location I worked at people were nice and was fun helping the customers find what the costume they wanted."
good,"when I worked at party city, I worked there for seasonal on Halloween. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I talked to customers, people are very nice"
good,Am looking forward to any and every seasonal employment offered to me through this company. This companies easy up and down workforce I found very enjoyable. From zero customers and building as workload to endless customers and accounting for tens of thousands of dollars I found this employer to be one of the greats on how they treat there employees whom are devoted.
good,I loved working for Party City. Halloween time was the busiest and the time where I met lots of different people. My co-workers were great. I loved preparing things for different types of celebrations.
good,Working at Party City was such a great/fun experience. everyday I would interact with customer helping them choose costumes and sizes. I really wish I had the opportunity to work for Party City more then just the Halloween Season.
good,Even though this was a seasonal job I really enjoyed. It was hard work but so much enjoyment. Went from building a temporary store to selling within a week or two. To helping people be anything that they want to be. After Halloween was over packing it away for next year.
good,"Clever and imaginative when confronted with obstacles. Outgoing and detail-oriented, and is proficient at building and maintaining professional relationships. I also shows a sincere interest in employees and the solutions to their problems."
good,"During the summer and fall season is when I receive the most work. Graduation and Halloween we would get around 30-40 hours a week.  I would help customers find a costume or I would be an extra cashier. For the rest of the year I've been getting 15-20 hours a week. Now I help out customers when needed, put new product out, blow up balloon orders, and run cashier."
good,"Halloween City was a very good choice for my first job! I met a lot of new people, and it was an overall fun working environment! I learned how to work a cash register, and I learned a lot about costumer service!"
good,"Working here has been great but management could immprove"
good,great to work for a franchise not for corporate understand what customers want great service and willing to work great with my vice president apart of the team with company
good,Turn on the lights and music to get the day going. Halloween is one of our most know holidays for us. Decorating and stocking up new items and rearrange certain isles. Co workers were very energetic and willing to help and learn. Would get the cashiers ready and put their drawers in the teal. Would do exchanges and returns and talk to customers if still didn't understand or wanted to talk to a manager
good,"For anyone that loves Halloween this would be the place to work. Always receiving new freight and there are always interesting props to go through. Interacting with the customers is definitely a fun part of the job, because you get to see their personalities come out with the costumes that they purchase."
good,Customer care is the number one priority along with ensuring product stock. Good co-workers. Very happy environment. Most enjoyable part is helping customers and making balloons.
good,Good company to work for in terms of job culture and work life balance and management is strong.   Strong company limited career growth unless you want to devote working 200 hours a week with your days off.
good,"Management was awesome."
good,Party city was a fun job to have at times. Mostly due to the customers who would ask for party planning advice. One would have to use their imagination in order to come up with unique ideas for everyone.
good,Its very busy with halloween coming. i learned that there is no other store that is as crazy as pary city during halloween. the management is great i love my bosses. the hardest part of the job is standing in one spot for long periods of time. the most fun part at the  job is we have fun we joke around with each other.
good,"We work hard as a team to push products and upsell, we are constantly on top of shop lifters."
good,I enjoyed working there I loved the people and the coworkers i got along with just about everyone.
good,-working on projects and my aisles assigned to me
good,"Being at party city during Halloween is very fun, and very challenging which is a good thing to me! My manager's are very respectful and people you can count on! they are very helpful people, the hardest part of my job is trying to please every customer at the same time! the most enjoyable part of my job was getting things done in time [=, i learned that we all can get the job don!"
good,a typical day was very fast paced and fun
good,"A fast paced work inviroment,with the enjoyment of meeting and"
good,"Party city was my first and only job and I learned a lot. I helped customers, I cleaned the store, and the managers was very respectful. I now know how to work with customers and the public."
good,The environment of the job is very welcoming everyone likes everyone and there's almost no conflict. The managers who work there are very respectful and know how to control their staff members.
good,I will help the boss run the store pick up stuff and make sure to greet customers walks at Walker play welcome to Halloween city let me know you need some help.
good,Company works well with their employees. Has great customer service reports. Has flexible schedulers. Topical day at work consist of maintaining the store in good / clean status.
good,"It was calm and when it was time to work, it felt like work. I was storaging most of the time so it was good work. People were nice and so were the customers"
good,"I loved working for Party City, however, I didn't get nearly enough hours to make a stable living with. The coworkers were basically a small family, most everybody got along, and the manager was EXTREMELY down to earth. If I got more Guaranteed hours? I would've stuck around, no doubt."
good,I was seasonal help at Party City at the time and it was the best first job that I had. Party City was a great first job and I recommend to anyone looking for a quick first job. It‚Äôs fast paced and very fun when you work seasonal.
good,"a good place to work very relaxed atmosphere, the people were very good, customers always asked for help overall a good steady job I have no real complaints."
good,"the work days were eventful, exciting and never too much to handle.Furthermore, everything was all about teamwork, from costumes all the way to top stock."
good,"i loved working around things that make me happy, however i am not a slow paced worker. i would rather interact and assist others. i had low hours, but it worked out with my home schedule."
good,"I‚Äôve heard horror stories about other stores and other associates but everyone at my store is great. We work well as a team, keep the store very clean, and have a great time. Overall a great place to work and I really enjoy coming in everyday. Really wish my role had more opportunities for growth and wish I didn‚Äôt work every Saturday."
good,"A typical day help customers check them out and close. Manager was so understanding, helpful and had a sense of humor. hardest thing is leaving after they told me i had a job at party city after halloween city and lied"
good,"Great place to work at while in college. Management works around schedule in their busy Halloween season, easy to pick up hours if you like being on call or a fill in. Fun place to work. easy to learn the layout of the store. They help you learn how to work at the cash register. Taking balloon orders takes practice buts gets easy over time."
good,"Truthfully, I had a really great time working at Party City. I didn't experience a lot, but at the same time I did. I met nice people and was entertained while I was working. I had a few bumps in the road, but they were able to work with me. There were times that it got stressful because of the amount of customers in the store or because of some customers having a bad day, but overall I had a great experience. It was my very first job and it was fun while it lasted. I was there for only a few days before they needed to let me go due to an overfilled roster of staff members, but Party City was fun and I would apply again."
good,"stocked shelf's, inventory, and received shipments."
good,I was a seasonal Halloween employee. So when I worked there for the holiday it would get occasionally busy almost every day. A typical day at work could be different every day. You go to the boss to see what section you are taking over for that day and it would be your responsibility to make sure it's neat before you go home that day. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be how busy it gets because time flies by and by the time you know it you accomplish so much and your day is over. The management was excellent and all the people I met were so nice and welcoming.
good,"Fun seasonal job for people of all ages, relaxed environment and energized atmosphere.  I enjoyed working here for three seasons and even worked with the company in the off season to  repackage merchandise."
good,"The main focus is on Halloween, but celebrating everything in between is a close second focus. Everyday is a new learning experience. As an employee you will learn more about holidays, blowing up balloons, and repeat customers. Management can be very interesting, some are there for enjoyment retail and others that are there for a paycheck. At the end of the day they all work as a team. Best part of the job is the little children in Halloween costumes and the happy faces of customers."
good,"I enjoyed working here for the few months that it was open, I had a great manager. It is a good job to get experience as a cashier and working in sales and with customers."
good,It‚Äôs fun working at party city for Halloween like I did. I was a seasonal sales associate. Being a sales associate you have to be able to be friendly help your customers out. Around Halloween time party city would have costumes so what I did was I would try to sale the costumer a costume then find the gadgets to go with it as well.
good,"Party city is a fun place to work, the people are nice and there are  opportunities for advancement if you have a solid work ethic. The training is typically very good, so it is a good choice for a first job. The management and other employees change relatively frequently, but it's retail so this is to be expected. I find the customers are, on average, happier than at most retail jobs, probably because of the location of the store and the nature of the merchandise the store has (people are happy to plan parties). The hardest part of the job is the Halloween season, but it's also a fun change of pace for that part of the year."
good,I loved working at Halloween city. It's bad that it's a temporary job. I would definitely go back if I could.  We got to dress up in the costumes while we worked.
good,"I loved it here, people were really nice and understanding , really helpful . Good focus job to do and have a little fun with it especially through out the holidays ! It can get Rowdy"
good,"This was a seasonal job I took because I Love Halloween and Love to work.  I like to be busy.  I enjoy working with people.  I love learning new things.  I had fun setting up the shelving, and product placement.  Helping customers find what they wanted.  I knew where almost every item was located so I could direct customers to what they were looking for, and if they didn‚Äôt know I loved helping them look at different items to see what they wanted."
good,Great starting job fresh out of high school. Easy to move up if you show commitment and are willing to work a lot. Really fun environment to be in for a job
good,"‚Ä¢	Responsible for all type of customer service"
good,"I love working here. I love our staff. I love seeing and making children happy, a happy child usually means a happy parent! We try providing the best customer service we possibly can. Managers try to work with you with hours and the times you can work as much as they can."
good,Interacting with customers and associates kept the work life alive and created a family environment for all. Kept you in the spirits for the holidays and big events.
good,"If you want an alternative store from Party City, than Halloween city is it, Only open from September to November of every year but they have more family friendly Halloween Props."
good,Was originally there as seasonal then hired me on full time.  After Halloween season it‚Äôs usually dead.  Mostly you are on the register with hardly any customers training was easy
good,"I enjoyed working at party city , it was seasonal but I gained friends very fast and everyone was enthusiastic. Management was wonderful and the environment was very comfortable."
good,"It was a fun working environment."
good,"seasonal, great people, customer service , fun, easy. get paied with a card not cash or check or dercit deposit. would love to do it year round , but cant"
good,"I love to enteract  with people so i enjoyed all my customers and they loved me also. fun place to work especially during Halloween, you get to dress up for the customers  and the kids love it."
good,Fun place to work without the normal hassles of a retail job. All customers are coming in for a party and they are in a good frame of mind. Love helping plan partys
good,"I like working at party city a day for me is helping customers find everything they need to have a fun time at there party, all they way down to there balloons."
good,Always exciting. Never a dull day. Great opportunities for learning and personal growth through consistant follow up and planner execution.
good,This was just a temporary job to fill in the time and earn a little money before optaining a full-time job or returning to college.
good,Everyone there was so cool. I got along with everyone and it was fun dressing up during the job. I met lots of people working the register that I wouldn't have met otherwise. I loved it.
good,Enjoyed the work environment . The management was very professional and reliable.  It is a very fun job to have.  All the different party themes and balloons.
good,"The job was all around fun. Being able to wear any hat in the store on the job, gave us that flair, that sense of customization and make us more presenting and fun to customers. Helping customers pick out costumes and find what they need was a blast. I only have one complaint, and that was after numerous phone calls, and me going in complaining about getting my last paycheck, it took over a month to get me the final $90.00 I was owed."
good,I loved working for Party City. I enjoyed all aspect of customer service and store maintenance. Especially during the Holiday Seasons never a dull moment.
good,"Learned how to interact with customers, Start on work immediately without having someone tell you, being a self-starter, being motivated & helping others. Ask co-workers for advice/help on stocking merchandise & being more talkative to the customers , asking them if they find everything okay & if they need help with anything else, greeting them friendly & hardest part is staying consistent with the rules of management & remembering where to put things, getting familiar with the store and where everything is at. Most enjoyable part of working at Party City is the pay-off of hard work & getting to meet new people that are doing the same thing as you."
good,I like working here and all of the employees. It is a great working environment. I just wish I had full time hours so I could have a consistent pay check.
good,"Go and sign in. Ask my manger what does he want me to do, and the get to work. I stock the whole place, and clean floors. Then I helping the customers. I also do the go backs."
good,Very fun & upbeat seasonal job. Lots of fun even when it's busy & chaotic.Very rewarding to take part in building up a store thats empty  & assembling racks & seeing the finished built up & running store.
good,This job will definitely teach you how to work with others and how to act in the work place. They also are very good with scheduling you around school.
good,I loved working for Halloween City. I learned a lot from this job I learned a lot about different cultures. I loved helping everybody with finding Halloween costumes and decorations. I learned everybody has their own way of doing Halloween with their children. The first year of working at Halloween City the management was awesome. I become close friends with everybody  from the works to the manager. I loved going to this job everyday and hated when I was off. The hardest party about the job was the breaking down of the store. After Halloween the store would still be open for a few days. Those last few days the employees start packing unsold items into a boxes and breaking down shelves. Nothing about the job was to hard to me though. I loved every minute of it. The most enjoyable part was coming to work everyday and working with the public.
good,"My overall Experience in the work force with the type of employment I have, has taught me patience, team work, dedication."
good,"I Helped customers find a costume, clean, put go backs away, greet customers, open and closed, organize and put away costumes/ items away."
good,"Worked on cash register, put returns back on shelf at end of shift, helped adults and children choose costumes and accesories for halloween."
good,A typical day at work would be dressing up in a costume and selling costumes and accessories to customers.. I learned creativity in creating a Halloween costume for customers. Management was fun and rewarding. Co-workers were fun and creative. The hardest part of the job was climbing tall ladders to retrieve Halloween masks. The enjoyable part of the job was dressing up in a different costume everyday.
good,"I never thought I would work at a party store. You get to dress up and have fun with co-workers and customers. It was a unique experience for me because I had never been to the Buffalo New York area, and here I was this Southern Girl lost in Yankeetown. I know I was strange to my co-workers because I looked at going somewhere just like going to the circus. I knew I was going to have fun and be amazed. I think that alot of my customers enjoyed that too, because everytime I went somewhere and did something new to me but old to them and they either heard me talking about to another customer or one of my fellow associates, I made that old place new to them once again. It was one of the best, scary experiences of my life. I'm no coward, I missed my family, I didn't understand a lot of the people but I wouldn't change those two years for the world. I still talk to my old co-workers sadly Corporate closed that Party City and they went on to better jobs, but I can't wait to visit next year and hang out with my Yankeetown besties."
good,"I really loved the work place an the customers were great but, i feel like there were too many employees an that was taking away from my hours."
good,"If you've worked in any other retail environment as a manager, you'll breeze through a season at HC.  It is a fly by the seat of your pants type environment, but that's what makes it different from any other thing you'll manage.  You'll snicker at the technology.  You'll smack your head in disbelief at the logistics.  You'll be amazed at how many people you'll stop interviewing just to get warm bodies in place.  Primarily, location will determine if you're a big dawg store in the region.  If you get a busy one, you'll enjoy the job a lot more.  Advice:  it's your store so act like it.  Hiring a good management team will make or break your season."
good,"Lots of fun creating ideas for costumes and helping people."
good,"I very much enjoyed my first year experience working for Halloween City in Livermore, Ca.  I was treated with the upmost respect when I interviewed as well as my first day on the job. I was offered the position of Executive Assistant after my first day. I appreciate that they noticed my ability as a seasoned customer service rep. and treated me as though I could offer them something as well. I learned alot of new skills as a assistant manager, I was able to open and close the store, I learned all about merchandising products and how to use a plan-o-gram. I absolutely loved my temporary job I had at Halloween City in Livermore, Ca. of 2012. I treated it as if it were any other regular job and I was sad when it ended after Halloween. The manager was very on top of her game and has had eight plus years working for this company. She enjoys it and they keep bringing her back because she is a pro and does it right!"
good,"A typical day at work would include unstocking new merchandise and putting it in its proper place. You have to frequently place items in their correct places, because the children always put it other places, especially the toy and candy aisles. I have learned organization skills and also great explanation skills with informing customers what merchandise is where. I have learned hot to greet customers and make sure they are doing fine with their shopping. The management is AWESOME!!!!! Everyone is pretty welcoming and has a very welcoming personality. My co-workers are pretty cool too. They are very informative when I need them and because I am new I ask a lot of questions and they never get impatient with me. The hardest part of the job is doing the cleaning up of the store because everything is mostly misplaced. Also the pay is pretty low for the amount of work you put into keeping the store organized. But what is mostly out of place is the candy and little toys that are easy accessible to the children. The most enjoyable part is being able to directly interact with customers and see their happy faces when you successfully assist them."
good,"General store maintenance, stock, maintaining orderly well stocked shelves, customer service.  A typical day would include fronting items on shelving, mopping, sweeping, maintenance.  For the season I was hired for I was responsible for finding customers costumes accurately and efficiently and returning product to precise location.  Minor use of inventory equipment and brief register experience.  Also assisted with filling balloons and personalizing certain items for customers."
good,"A typical day was never typical. I always had things to do. If it wasn't cleaning and keeping up on tidyness of costumes, then it was maintaining the ""hot"" wall. I enjoyed the open atmosphere and fair treatment."
good,"While at Halloween City I learned how to operate a cash register, how to interact with customers and upsell products. A typical day at work involved restocking the shelves, pricing items, interacting with customers, upselling products and the operation of the cash register."
good,"It is a seasonal job, so there is not a lot of time to work there, but it is very fun to work there in the short time you have. Usually you are walking around asking people what they are being for Halloween and you get to help them pick out the perfect costume. It is so much fun. The workers are usually nice and fun, the management is very laid back and fun and you learn a lot about people. It is defiantly a fun place to work."
good,This was only a seasonal job for halloween. which is one of my favorite holidays. I felt t home and comfortable.
good,I loved this work environment and the people that I worked with. Being it was a seasonal store you truly felt involved because you assisted in putting the store together and taking it down.
good,It was a good experience. everything went smooth. I would recommend anyone looking for a fun and good time to apply to party city. It was colorful and busy every day of work.
good,Good place to work if teenager. Good attitudes. Not really much else to say it's a good job. Meet alot of people on different moods u may be speaking to someone that just lost someone or expecting.
good,"There was one employee who was negative, other than that it is a place to work at.  Getting to see children's faces when they see their ballots getting blown up and the satisfaction of putting together ideas customers want are really satisfying."
good,I would recommend working here for job experience and customer service experience because you really have to get to know the customers while you help them out and get them what they need in order to satisfy them before they walk out those doors.
good,"As a former employee I loved working there. They work with your schedule, they‚Äôre very personable and outgoing. Sometimes it gets stressful during the holiday seasons and graduation, but that is the busy time. Other than that I was very comfortable and enjoyed working for them."
good,meeting different customers in one day is exciting. But having more then one customer trying to talk at one time can get a little overwhelming and that's when you would have to take control of the situations
good,"It was an easy job that was fun because customers came to Halloween City for FUN. When the customers come in happy and you can discuss cosplay or halloween costumes, it's a fun day. It was frustrating when you'd finally get a section straightened out and organized, then some customers would come through and tear it apart to try everything on and just throw it all on the ground."
good,Fun place to work gets to see all different kinds of party theme to choose from. Fun atmosphere everythint is well kept nice and organized so that finding the the things you need is easy.
good,"fun, full of color. learned to work under pressure and a lot of math and multitasking work. free style independent work tasks, loved doing the balloon orders, hardest parts was dealing with aggressive customers"
good,Working at party city you have to stay  focused and busy . Make sure that the customer are happy when they walk in and when they walk out. Have fun while doing it makes the job better.
good,"a great place to work, every time i left to go to school they always allowed me to come back with out an issue. I've been working here for 4 years and i love it although the pay could be better."
good,I worked at party city around Halloween time for a temporary position . it was a very interactive energetic job that i loved . i enjoyed helping ppl make decisions on party decor or costume choices .
good,"its quick pace, you learn the store pretty fast. discount of 30%. the employees all work very well together and everyone that works there is very kind."
good,"It a cool place to work, just a lot to handle sometimes. It's not a place for someone who cannot work at a quick pace, and multi task. Still a fun place to work."
good,"Fun place to work. Friendly Co workers and management. Good atmosphere, looked forward to going to work everyday. I enjoyed the challenge of assisting customers with any questions they had. Assisted with locating items and if we were out of a item I would suggest an item close to what the were looking for."
good,I enjoyed my time working with co-workers and the customers were friendly as well. Rush hour was always fun. Running the cash register was my favorite job.
good,Best experience with amazing coworkers as well as customers. Was able to handle lines of customers down the 1st aisle in an orderly fashion. Always recounted money back twice due to the fact of being rushed.
good,will only work there seasonal for 2 years straight it was super fun everyone there is super nice you feel like home when your there .The customer are nice too you just get a good vibe because it so color fun and so open .
good,Halloween City was an enjoyable place to be employed during the Halloween season. Great co-workers and management. The position can vary greatly from fast paced customer service to sweeping the floor slowly.
good,"The sales associates we all super friendly and easy to get along with, although not the most reliable (which meant you could pick up an extra shift or two if wanted). The management was knowledgeable and helpful, and handled situations of all sorts in a professional manner. Managers from other locations would go help other stores when needed and able. The district manager was kind but did what needed to be done, and was friendly and informative. A typical workday was usually somewhat slow with bursts of busy, but easy to handle with the right amount of associates available. The hardest part of the job is right around Halloween, when customers try to get a discount on perfectly good costumes for minor reasons, but managers can handle that. The best part was easily the atmosphere and culture. You were encouraged to dress up and use makeup to enhance the customer's experience. It was overall a very enjoyable job."
good,"I was only there for the month of October because I was there as a seasonal job for Halloween, It was a bit stressful because lots of people were wanting costumes that we did not have because they would wait until the last minute to come to the store right before Halloween and expect us to have the costume they want in store and they would get mad and yell and it got really annoying, close to when I was done I started to get made fun of for I don't know why but that is the reason I did not go back"
good,"I was at Party City during Halloween season. It was a fun job to have. Basic stocking, cleaning, lifting is required, also customer service is very important."
good,I enjoyed working at Party City I 2as only hired for a seasonal position though and wasn't hired full time I applied myself every day I worked the floor
good,I loved working here for the holiday season it was such a fun fast paced environment. The managers are amazing here and I would recommend working foe this company to anyone that was interested.
good,Great store for any I mean any party's you have. They taught me how to mange a cashier.  They worked wit me while I was in school. Great people. Great place if you want to learn how to mange any party's to help people mange their party or theme or and idea.
good,Love my coworkers love the friendly work environment hate the limited room for promotions and limited available hours resulting in poor pay. I have worked there for 2 years have only been allowed to work part time and i barely reach 20hrs a week if im lucky. I would like them to show more concern for security and safety of their stores and product management. If theft wasn't so high the stores wouldn't be taking such financial losses and employees wouldn't have to take hour/pay cuts. I would like to see them show more appreciation for their employees by adding hours and possibly higher pay if hours can not be added.
good,It's a great place to work. Management team is very fun to work with but still get the job done professionally. I recommend working here as a part time job.
good,"The managers that were hired did well to do their jobs and help any way they could. They didn't just supervised, they helped on the floor, at the registers, cleaning up at the end of the night. Fast money and easy work if you've worked with registers before and have cleaned."
good,"I worked here through college, nothing exciting. Halloween is crazy around there but very paced and super happy place. My mangers was cool and co workers were cool."
good,"It was a fun atmosphere. The crew workers were very friendly but, they barely gave me any hours, there wasn't much customers..... The manager wasn't really there, and they never moved up my position, like he did for everybody else"
good,"This is mainly a first-job for kids."
good,"Working at Party City was the most difficult job I'd ever had, physically. You have to be MOVING and I mean moving! For about 9 hours depending on your schedule. But you completely forget the hard work you're doing because simply being there is like being at Six Flags! Super fun environment and great friendly people. I learned a lot while working here."
good,"Great place to work. Had no complaints, just wish I could've continued to work there. Early Starts was a challenge to begin but after a few days it was just a normal role. Its one of the more fun part time jobs I had."
good,"awesome place to work, couldn't keep working there because school was getting in the way with my work schedule. overall great bosses, great co-workers."
good,A very fun place to work during the Halloween season. Fast paced and entertaining. Co-workers and Management were all great to work with and very helpful.
good,"Party City is awesome for any event so when i was hired for a seasonal position i was excited . My work detail consisted of Setting up Halloween displays ,assisting customers with costumes ,sales on special items , answering phones, placing orders by phone to our sister store for items we may of sold out on .the downer of this employement was that it was seasonal there was only one position open for hire and it was decided by a sell off , i come in second congratulated the winner and saw it as room for growth."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at PartyCity in Rochester Hills. Seasons and holidays go by fast when you are working at PartyCity. Working here can be exciting and keep you on your toes because the shelves and aisles need constant change. "
good,"In party city I learned how to attend a costumer. with kindness and respect. Include multiple options as on which product's suits them the best, also greeting everyone when they entered the store."
good,"I absolutely loved working here, it was fun and i was mostly busy but never too busy. hopefully i can find another job here. the only downfall would be the management."
good,I so enjoyed working there as everyone is always excited especially around celebration time.  It was my absolute pleasure to help people.
good,"I never had a day while i worked there, you never knew what you were walking into that day or what the day was going to bring you , might have helped because it was a costume story and you were allowed to wear some of the costumes. Wish they decided to place on here in Saint John besides a tester store."
good,"Pros"
good,"Halloween City is an excellent temporary company to work for.  My Market Manager provided excellent resources, yet allowed me the leverage to run my store in the most effective way possible."
good,I was a general manager and I was able to use my strong communication skills to lead my employees during the fall season. I handled difficult situations and enjoyed the fast pace.
good,"I worked at Halloween City for 2 seasons now, I also worked at Party City and even though its owned by the same companies, they are so much different.  Halloween City is a fun filled environment.   I enjoyed it so much I hope to work there this year!  It was extremely slow at first but closer and closer to Halloween we were so packed, you didn't have time to take a break.  I was one of the managers both seasons so we had to relieve the staff and give them breaks.  Time flew by so fast.  Really fun."
good,"The job itself is a great place to work at. Everyone there is basically a family and is extremely understandable with each other. All it takes it great skills and a humorous personality, it will get you far in life."
good,"A typical day at work would depend on what the strongest skill one has. For example, if you know how to arrange merchandise according to instructions you work on the floor and if one is fast with money your place would be as a cashier. As you work there you learn how to inflate a balloon, be a cashier, and help customers with questions. The effort shown is the tool to get managers to teach you more skills. "
good,"The first thing I would do would be to get my vest and walkie talkie and clock in. From there I would see what station I was going to be at. After finding out My station I would do the assigned tasks for that station."

good,"I was the Executive Assistant for the season, I learned a lot. my management team was amazing, we learned a lot from each other and grew as a whole team. hardest part of my job was leaving at the end of season. co-workers were great, hard working and willing to do what it took to make the customer happy. I enjoyed helping kids find exactly what they were looking for and seeing how happy they were to be getting their costumes."
good,Management was well. We had food and snacks during the week leading up to Halloween for team members in the back. Some what drawn out due to not many customers before 12.
good,Work mostly standing for long period of time in a fast paced and challenging environment. Very supportive towards my co-workers and management in general. Used to have my own retail business so I understand customer service and sales goals.
good,"It's a once in a lifetime opportunity to experience an entire life cycle of a retail store, from set up, opening, hiring and training all new associates, getting through a busy season, and wrapping up and closing at the end of the season. Once open a typical day is you go and open the store, especially at the beginning of the season process new merchandise, continue to train and coach your associates, and of course you are taking care of the customers as well. I always found the management solid, especially since they had a proven system that worked."

good,"I was hired for Halloween season . The hours were great but the management was the problem . Every other manager was fine , but managers had their kids working there and they felt entitled to anything. Did not want to be involved with anything . Great company though ."

good,"As the operational manager, we discussed daily or goals and expectations. Divided the associate among the different daily task."

good,"(I was working this job at the same time as my eBay job so I could get more money so I could pay off the rest of my Hospital Bills) (And I worked it again this year at the same time as Vivint, for fun). My job was to make sure that Customers who were checking out, got rung up, and to restock the Halloween supplies, also to organize the store if I had to come in in the mornings so that it looked nice and presentable, and to be a watch at the Dressing Rooms to make sure customers were not stealing any merchandise.(This was only a Seasonal Job. Halloween City is only open during the Months of September and October, and then November they pack up the store. Due to my back injury, I was not able to stay and help pack the store up in November. They stated that I did a good enough job that they are willing to Rehire me every year During those two months should I need a small help/boost in money again)( and I've already taken them up on that offer to rehire as a fun temporary job when I was hired again for September and October earlier this year of 2018)."
good,"Everyone mostly, were very kind and helpful. Customers were kind for the most part. Had times where it was slow, had times when it was super busy. Super cool"
good,Expect to be called in last minute almost everyday or to come in early or stay late. Stores are often understaffed especially at Halloween. Also be aware of having shifts pulled if your email numbers drop even slightly. Not a lot of training but a really great team to work with
good,Had a lot of fun working at this location for seasonal. The staff was very nice and encouraging. The hours per week increased as it got closer to Halloween.
good,"On a regular day at work it was nice and easy most mornings i would open some days i would close but i enjoyed everyone there, only thing i didn't like was the pay rate i was receiving 7.75 and as it got closer for me to leave that's when the pay rate went up to 8.00."
good,Everything was great working for Party City I can honestly say that I really enjoyed working here over the holiday seasons. The management team was awesome.
good,"It is a really fun place to work here, I currently assist people getting costumes for them in the back of the store, the people are really nice to work with some of them are even really funny the manager is nice and is willing to work with your schedule the hardest part of the job is standing on my feet for 6 hours at a time also the most enjoyable thing I like about it there is the people and interacting with customers I would highly recommend this place to work especially as a first job management is a little goofy when it comes to the application problems but they got It fixed quickly"
good,"Fast pace,Friendly, amazing products, family friendly, Tons of this to do never the same day twice. I learned even the friendly people have sticky fingers."
good,"On a typical day it was pretty smooth but it was pretty busy on the weekends like saturday mornings were the worse because we had a lot of balloon orders to fill in such little time. The managers were trying to help as much as they can but they were busy too with all the online orders, The hardest part of my job is getting all the balloon orders filled on time."

good,"It's interesting to see how creative or lack there of, people can and cannot be. It's beneficial if the employees are creative and positive thinkers that get involved and actually assist in people's wants and needs to be unique and fun or scary for their personal needs, such as halloween time or other such ideas"
good,The work environment was fun. You are able to interact with the customers to find the right supplies for their events. It was also great working during the peak season (Halloween).
good,Very fast paced work environment but also very rewarding.Great coworkers and all of the mangers were nice and easy to deal with on a daily basis.starting is minimum wage part time but when you get into management you have more opportunities for growth
good,Great place to work.  Great upper management with good communication skills.  Organized with policy and procedure manuals.  Halloween is the most stressful time.
good,"I did not want to leave Party City, however I had another full time job and it was only meant for a part time to get some more money. "
good,"the management at Party City was not that great . The managers would sit on their phones and bark orders , and not pay attention to an employee if one of us needed help . I loved helping customers find the perfect costume tho for sure ! seeing a small child's face light up was priceless and made the job worth it ."
good,In my experience it was well managed with a wonderful work environment. I worked along side excellent co-workers and thoroughly enjoyed my time working there.

I worked part-time evenings and weekends. Management was great; may manager was easy to work for. I did not receive any benefits because I already had benefits with my full-time job. It was easy to get a day off and I was not interested in advancing."
good,"i was helping out a customer with her Halloween costume , and she was putting things together that would go good with it. no one in the store was willing to take care of her and have patietns with her but i did. she gave me a really good report to the manager."

good,To be honest some of the worker seem to had more free time then helping new workers learn there skills or help when other works wasn't around.. manager was to laid back
good,Learned customer service skills dealing with store guest on a daily basis at a variety of positions. Every day was new task or project to take on and it made the job fun.

good,"Very fun place to work."
good,"Working at Halloween City allowed me to be myself creatively and professionally. The location was close to home and the staff were amazing. We had difficult times, but it wasn't anything teamwork couldn't fix. I enjoyed working there."
good,flexible job nice work environment  manager was very understanding when I needed a day off for a doctor's appointment great to work during Halloween but after that hours start going way down but overall I like working here I get along very well with all my coworkers
good,"A typical day at Party City consisted of constant team work! every manager and, co-worker had one another's back. Even then, we made sure we'd get our assigned jobs well and finished on our own."
good,"I loved working at Party City (Halloween City). They worked around my school schedule all the time. I never had any real problems with my job. The only downfall is most of the time you get short breaks and short lunches. But, I was a sales associate and I would say working here was just the same as other retail, maybe even better."
good,Party City wasn't a bad working experience. My manager was cool and easy going. He always made sure we were comfortable with the schedule. The only problem i had was that some of the employees were lazy.
good,"Work is typically slow when the holidays are not around, and can be a tad boring. But when the holidays do come along our job becomes very fast paced, which is something I enjoy. "
good,easy going work days blowing up blowing was the most fun part i learned how to blow up balloons and the difference between them. my manager was an butt never let anyone have days off. co works were funny and easy going
good,"Halloween City, was the most fun job I have held so far. getting to help customer with their needs in costumes was a blast. everyone their was so nice and fun to be around. The environment of the workplace made it a joy to go to work. Management was honest and fair, always giving us new positions to keep things interesting, Came out of their with so many new and improved skills, and some new life long friends."
good,"I only worked seasonal for halloween, so there was always something to do. I had to be very attentive to detail while recovering the store. The management was great, very personable. Diversity among co-workers because they hired so many people during this time. The hardest part of the job was trying to not get bored of the same thing, constantly picking up after kids and adults that don't know how to put things back where they found them. It was enjoyable because there was never a dull moment."
good,Halloween city is a great seasonal job for anybody. You have tons of fun and love to go to work. You get to dress up and be a kid. The work is super easy and you enjoy doing it.
good,"A typical day at work started off slow in the morning and when child came in without parents items were broken and or stolen, by the child or the parent themselves. I learned even child pick up their parents bad habits. Management she had to work other locations, but came or called when needed. The hardest part is telling a customer they are stealing costumes, by shoving two costumes in one bag while they are in line denying the facts. The most enjoyable part of the job was wearing costumes on Halloween."
good,"I had a lot of fun at Party city. Managers were good and employees were nice. There really isnt much to say. Shipping and receiving was super easy, and i hear they dont have it anymore there."
good,This is one heck of a fun place to work. Everything is laid back. You wear whatever fun outfit you like. Management is very relaxed granted you do your job. Everyone is fun. Gets super busy at Halloween. Too bad their open a few times in a year.
good,"The job experience was very good for a temporary position.  They were very considerate of my work schedule.  I was working another job, so I really appreciated the accommodation.  My typical day would consist of helping customers and making sure that my area was clean and properly stocked.  The co-workers were pleasant and the management was very helpful.  I learned that I really like the sorting and stocking version of the job."
good,Party city was an excellent place to work at in the holidays. They also are very excellent in working with peoples schedules if some people where on the buses.
good,Cashier is usually where i am placed. My duties are usually welcoming costumers answering the phone making sure the front looks presentable and clean and also blowing up balloons
good,"Theirs always something new, you never stop learning. You may think you know it all one day then the next day you learn something new. I work best when I know what to do and management is always good at letting you know what needs to be done. The hardest part would have to be the customers at times. In the area we are in there are some very rude ones, but know matter what you have to be professional. The most enjoyable part is the employees, everyone gets alone and theirs never any drama. Its a family atmosphere."
good,Floor associates stock merchandise and assist customers with any questions. Front cashiers ring customers out and keep area tidy.
good,"Great place to learn a lot of customer service skills. Co-workers were awesome, management was great. Nothing was hard about this job you always had help with everything."

good,"A typical day at work involved assisting customers in selecting goods to buy on the floor, as well as on the telephone when customers would call in to ask about a specific product."
good,"Fun environment, only a temp store. Upper management shows you how to do things properly instead of complaining or demanding you redo things."
good,"A typical day at Halloween City wasn't like every day, the costumes kept me entertained and my attention up. I learned something everyday there almost including characters people admitted to being at parties and get-togethers'. The manager was a gal who had just as much work as the rest of us, though she was in charge of the money at the end of the day and other material duties. My co-workers were funny and had something new up their sleeve every day. The hardest part of the entire experience was the clean up after Halloween was over. The most enjoyable part was seeing the costumes and dark scary stuff that have been in shows and movies."
good,Party City was a great place to work.  Halloween gets a little tough but it is enjoyable.  Never a dull moment!
good,"Very relaxed and focus. Busy environment. Learned something new each day. Management was very conscious of work performance and production. Coworkers were very cooperative and inspirational. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the high volume of clients applying for variety of services. The most enjoyable part of the job was, at the end of the day, daily goals were met and clients were satisfied."
good,Typical day at Halloween City includes slow mornings and busy nights especially towards the middle of October. While I was working at Halloween City I learned how to count out cash drawers and merchandise products. The management and co-workers for this company were fantastic. The managers were willing to work around schedules and were understanding. I would say the hardest part of being a cashier at Halloween City was working two days before Halloween and the actual day of Halloween but that was the most enjoyable part of working for this company also.
good,"Where you get to be yourself."
good,"The people I worked with at Party City were AWESOME! they made it fun to go to work. When it was really really busy as you could imagine during Halloween time my co-workers and managers were really helpful & supportive. I would pull costumes for people, clean and restock the store, cashier, help customers, etc. I learned not to be nervous when working in retail. I learned to just be yourself and talk to the customer like you're talking to your buddy. There wasn't really anything hard about my job, I guess maybe blowing up balloons because I always popped them. The most enjoyable part of my job was my awesome team & getting good feedback from customers."
good,"It's always a busy day here and there's always something to do. Not a good job for those looking to stand around and chill because I'm always on the move. You're either out on the floor recovering the store, at the registers, or inflating balloons. Halloween is probably the hardest time of the year, and it gets really insane! I've always been good at working under pressure, but if that is not you than you might have a difficult time here. But I enjoy every minute of it. I enjoy the challenge, and I'm always learning something new."
good,"Learned to clean buildings inside and out. Managed to do repairs for most problems such as fixing doors, walls, ceilings, plumbing, and electrical."
good,"customer service, cashier, balloons, freight planograms, downstock, topstock, recovery, clean. i've leaned alot from here, how to do sets, freight, downstock, balloons. love my co workers. hardest part is halloween traffic, but its all fun. most enjoyable is planograms the sets, and frieght. just learning anything new there."
good,I learned how to come out of my comfort zone and help customers out with what they need. The hardest part of my job at Halloween City was cleaning up after a long busy day of work. I enjoyed being able to work with customers of all ages and being able to get to know them a little better. A typical day at work for me would be greeting and checking out customers.
good,"Great seasonal job! If your a big fan of Halloween then this place is awesome to work at during the Halloween season. Although very busy and hectic, if you have a strong work ethic you can get the job done and get it done well!"
good,"a typical day at work was really busy an it makes time fly"
good,"Amazing management team at Cdn HO."

good,I had lots of fun with customers helping them with their costumes.
good,A typical day at Party City is some what a crazy and hard working job.
good,Fun workplace
good,Security guard
good,Halloween City is a family friendly store which commits to making sure each customer is happy and they return. We have a very strong team which is lead by amazing staff. I would have to say working around so many unique personalities has been a lot of fun and has given me even more experience in the public
good,"Everyday at work, I would get so many questions that I loved to help out with because it was about planning parties. Being a busy place during holidays (halloween) I learned how to be a very fast cashier and to keep customers happy with helping out with everything that they needed. Management was strict, of course, with everything but they made work a fun place to be at. My co-workers made the day go by faster, being friendly and never had any conflicts with anyone. The hardest part of the job was stocking new shipments because a lot of things were moved around. The most enjoyable part of the job was being friends with everyone there because we knew we didn't have to be shy and feel awkward at work."
good,I loved working with the people that I did. Halloween is my favorite holiday if it was open all year round I would make it my career.
good,"Halloween City is a seasonal job where customer service really comes into play. Everyone gets along and rotates there positions on a daily basis. It can be very stressful as well at times, being a seasonal business it is only open a couple of months out of the years and can be very busy at times. The best part of the job is that when people come in there it is for fun and that's what they get."
good,moderate pace lively customers. management substantial. the hardest part is meeting deadlines for balloon orders on a busy day. but the easy of all we help make the occasion special.
good,Overall the job was enjoyable and fun. I learned some valueable management skills so that i could have a better opportunity for hire at other locations. Co-workers were friendly and productive.
good,"i had a great time working for this company, the location i worked at was always busy"
good,"I count the five+ years I spent at Party City among the most enjoyable and fulfilling work experiences of my life so far. The customer interactions at a place like this are always so positive: Party City is a place people shop when they want to, not when they have to, and this leads to an easygoing and carefree workplace environment. Highly recommended for anybody interested in a customer service position, without all the hassle of negative customer interactions."
good,It's a great place the employees and management make the ambience of the place lively. The managers are willing to work with your schedule if you go to college.
good,"I ran the back room and gave out costumes when needed."
good,"It was a fun place to work, the people there were fantastic to work with and it was never a dull day. The work did require a lot of climbing up and down ladders so it isn't for those who aren't comfortable with it but you get use to it pretty quick, the management is pretty laid back as long as you are doing your job and doing it right."
good,"Each day can be fast, medium, or slow paced depending on the day of the week and the season (i.e. Halloween, graduation). I have built up customer service skill sets, managerial functions, and technical skills. The management is encouraging, understanding with personalizing work hours and schedules, and willing to help. The hardest part of the job is probably multi-tasking and is something the employee will have to work at. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the team every day because everyone works well together and is a cohesive team."
good,I enjoyed working at party city and would not mind going back. The training was great because i understood what to do. the hardest part of the job is only when we are very busy and we want to take care of every guest in a timely matter. i love blowing up the balloons and putting smiles on the people's faces.
good,I enjoyed working at party city as a seasonal worker.  my job was to get costumes for customer's and keep store clean.  I liked helping people. I know i have a lot to bring back to this year.
good,"Working at party city isn‚Äôt a very hard task if you are good at speaking with customers, answering questions and dealing with multiple things at once."
good,Good Job for someone with little to no work experience as everyone is very patient and are willing to teach you what to do in a very relaxed environment.
good,"There was a good bit of fun, although stressful at times you become closer. I got it as a quick seasonal job to earn a buck but it turned out to be much more than that."
good,"Management always had something planned for every worker and provided adequate worktime for each associate so they'd never remain bored or lack things to do. Everybody worked together for restock and storage room, cleaning, cashiering, and more, and no position was ever left simply for 1 associate or manager to do. Understaffing was never a problem, nor was overstaffing, and tasks were, therefore, always possible and hardly stressful in the slightest."
good,I love working here.. It's a friendly working environment.. I love helping people making them feel at home..  Making sure they have a great experience...
good,"fun fast paced work but did not have a work life balance.  I was an hourly manager bur was expected to work off the clock many times because the salary manager was ""working off the clock"""
good,It was not only fun working with the little kids helping them pick costumes but my coworkers were fun to hang out with. My manager was a great boss because she'd help us get our work done then she was so laid back that when there was barely any costumers we'd dress up in costumes temporarily and scare each other  or twin in outfits or have a specific theme. This was my Favorite job of all.
good,Party City is a friendly environment to work in. There is plenty of training that you can choose from. I would recommend working at Party City........
good,"its a good place to be at and it is a very relaxed area when it comes to co workers and customers, everyone is very respectful without a doubt, i would come back if i could."
good,"There is never a ""typical"" day. In these positions I learned so much about leadership, being an effective presenter, and manage store operations. The culture is fast paced.  The most frustrating part of the job is investigating loss prevention issues and realizing that people you expected to be honest are not.The most enjoyable part of the job would be the level of growth and mentorship I achieved and received here."
good,"A typical day at work included having fun with staff members also having fun helping costumers find the perfect costume for them. "
good,it was a fast paced job where you get to connect with other people that you really do not know and collaborate with them. Everyone work together as a team and do there part of the job...
good,"I've learned how to correctly deal with customer's at this corporation. My manager's have taught me all of the up's and down's of working In retail which I endlessly thank them for. The hardest part  and also the best part of this job for me personally, was definitely blowing up balloons constantly."
good,Always Had GOOD days At party city did a lot of fun things always was rotating getting to work with others as a team learned how to do alot of in the store i enjoyed doing a lot of customer service things
good,"Truly, working there was so far my favorite place to work. My coworkers and supervisors were wonderful, my workdays sometimes could be hard and stressful, but even on those days, my job was fun. "
good,"The costumers were always pleased to be shopping, there was never any problems, well organized and calm. Helping people with ideas was I think the most enjoyable about it, also blowing up the balloons."
good,"The typical day at party city would be of course clocking in making sure you have on your walky talky because that was your way of communicating with your coworkers. Filling up balloons, making sure everything was in stock . figuring out which postion your going to be in for that day"
good,Some long days by worth it. I enjoyed hiring my own crew and having control over the sales possibilities. Dressing up in costumes is the best part of the job.  Love it even when it was busy and stressful.
good,I learned to work a register. I loved being in a fast paced environment. The hardest part of my job was remembering to drink water. I most loved being able to work around people.
good,A typical day at work included clocking in and starting my work as a cashier and sales associate. I learned how to restock aisles and how to maintain a clean work area in a retail store.
good,"I enjoyed helping customers, the management was wonderful and accepting. It helps to be persistent when you apply for employment with them. They were not very good with legal breaks."
good,"The manager i had was the best manager i have ever had in a work environment, they are very chilled but get work done, if you are looking for a lazy job this will not be the place for you."
good,I was a sales associate at a Halloween store  and a typical day at work was attending  to  the customers for what they needed in the store. Also was working at the cash register
good,"Party City was a seasonal job for me. the staff are always excited to work and the customers are very friendly (for the most part). Each employee has a station appointed to them. Whether they are a cashier, working on the costume wall, or given one or two aisles to help any customers who enter it. The employees got to know each other and the manager at the time was very cool and made sure we had fun but also that we were doing our job."
good,Working at Party City I started off as a seasonal employee for Halloween but quickly proved myself to the management team by going above and beyond. I was able to stay longer and was even offered the opportunity to grow in the company. The management team is very helpful and works hard to satisfy customer needs as well as to look after their employees.
good,"Working at such a well-known retail company allowed me to have lots of person-to-person interaction, along with being able to be in a comfortable environment. The workplace was completely organised because of the 'rules,' but nonetheless, the employees maintained the stores cleanliness which was the hardest part of the job, honestly. Having to return demos/cases of inventory from the store front back to display was only needed to be done so often. I mainly resided in Operations, though i did get to understand all departments and my experience was good considering how easy i picked up on the tasks that take place in a shift."
good,I learned many great skills and management enhancing tools in my time with Party City. It's a great work environment with great associates and  a stellar management team.
good,"Clocked In "
good,great experience to work with others and helping customers. Very easy to learn the basics of the store and its just a friendly environment to work in.
good,"A typical day of work at part city would be very fun and different. Tasks will be giving to you throughout the day. My time at party city I learned how to place costume orders through the mobile handheld device and placing orders on the phone for items. The management at party city was great and so respectful. In my opinion the hardest part of party city was the cleaning up at the end of the night and getting it ready for the next day,  it  wasn't that hard but it was much work. I enjoyed the customers and working as a team with my co-workers the best. Party city is a really fun environment to work in."
good,it was a good atmosphere at party city. everyone was nice I was just quite cause I'm naturally quite but can easily talk to people as well it was honestly a pretty good job
good,"Even though it was a serious job, the management made it very enjoyable to work there. You always wanted to be doing something and everybody was grateful for any type of work you did. The staff got along and were willing to cover shifts when something unexpected popped up. A super great place to work!"
good,Every year that I have worked with Halloween City has been fun and interesting. I was the GM this year and we had a great team. We worked hard and made upper management very impressed with how puts together the store was and how well the store operated
good,"I wish it would stay open all year round but unfortunately it's only seasonal for halloween. I worked with great employees we all got along and had a great time, my boss and assistant managers were also very down to earth and treat us fairly."
good,"It was decent.  The pay could be better for hours you work. But, the managers to the employees worked well as a team.  The manager over the store managers needs a bit of work though."
good,"A typical day at this job would be blowing up balloons for balloon orders or walk-ins, getting people in and out the line at the registers, putting back returns, zoning each aisle and making sure you can see the products easily and making sure they're in the right place. Management is really nice but never follows through with anything they tell you, or anything they want you to do. The hardest part of the job was down stocking aisles which it wasn't really that hard just tedious. The most enjoyable part was that all of the employee's were and are really friendly and there was never any real drama."
good,While working at Party city I was only a seasonal employee for two years in a row. Everyone was very friendly while I was there. I worked mainly in stocking and assisting customers.
good,"party city is very fast pace around the halloween time , saturday will be your most busy day, management is great, customer service is great, the job is very easy to understand"
good,"Working at Party City for Halloween as seasonal but fun my days went by fast, good hours were included.. A typical day at work was two weeks before Halloween it was stressful.. The aisle were messy, people would often steal.."
good,"It's usually pretty busy especially during September because it's close to Halloween, but time goes by fast since it's busy and it's really fun during those times."
good,"Party city has been my favorite job thus far. It is very laid back, and very easy. The managers are willing to work with you if you have a problem, and they are very patient with newcomers."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at party city. No hassle. Easy job, as long as you did your part. Definitely goal oriented and necessary to ensure that you complete your job properly"
good,fun working enviroment.friendly managment .good hours .flexible schedules.most enjoyable part is being able to complete customers purchases in a friendly manner
good,Love the enjoy and people that work there. I always looked forward to working whatever day they had me on. The weekends can get crazy but they are fun. I'd recommend to anyone.
good,Awesome part time job. Great customers! Awesome time during Halloween time. Have a lot of party supplies and great holiday set ups. Perfect place to get balloons.
good,I absolutely loved working at Party City. I started out as a stock worker and quickly advanced to a cashier and team lead ending up in becoming the assistant manager. It is a very fun environment with a lot of potential for advancement.
good,I love working in an environment that allows me to use my creativeness and attention to detail to help customers. Party City is a fun and fast paced place to work.
good,"Its a fun environment, very fast pace and steady work place. They listen to your ideas and develop a strategy around your ideas. The management team is awesome"
good,"A typical day for me would checking balloon orders, filling my candy, taking inventory, checking expiration dates, keeping up with the clearance candy, and attending to customers. Taking that this is my first job, i learned a lot. Everything a bigger worker could learn at a retail job. I can say though that i learned to have better organization skills. Working at party city, seeing people 3-5 times a week, spending 5-8 hours a day with them, we've become a family. The hardest part of my job was keeping up with filling the candy and checking the expiration dates."
good,I helped to stock the store and helped start up the new location. I was constantly doing things and moving things in the store to make it looking appealing to customers. I also helped customers as needed.
good,Working for party city was a great experience the people are fun and you get to have some fun with it. You get to meet a bunch of new people. It can get a little challenging but it is worth it.
good,Do your job the right way and you will be fine! You could be stocking shelves or running the register. The management is great and easy to get along wiht.
good,"I loved working here, nice job, with great people. Not too much to handle and not too little to be bored. Managers are good people, and the shifts are nice as well."
good,"Work on register help the costumers. "
good,"Greet all the people who walk in and assist them by finding what they're looking for. Learned to treat customers as someone special, like a friend. Managers were amazing and inspired me to work hard each day i walked in. The hardest part of the job for me was preparing balloons quickly. Meeting new people and helping them find everything they need."
good,"This company is a good place and the work is not hard at all. Cashiering, stocking, go backs, and doing balloons all part of typical day."
good,This job was easy. I was able to help people find what they wanted. Would rather have a job that you are always busy at. It was a great first job to have and I learned a lot of responsibility from it.
good,"great company to work for i enjoy the people who work and the people I work with. Overall this is a good company to work for, great managers also they are terrific"
good,In the beginning I thought oh this should be easy..oh boy was I wrong! I learned so many effective management styles and techniques. Being in such a laid back business environment taught me a lot about myself as well as how to delegate to my peers and people older than myself. I would have to say keeping a clear and calm head when things got crazy busy was a true test of character. In conclusion I enjoyed every bit of smiles and frowns and would do it again!
good,The people was nice and your legs will hurt at the beginning but you will get use to it. The hardest part about the job is people stealing the costumes out of the beg but the enjoyable part about the job is to help people.
good,Working at party City was fun and exciting. I worked well with my former employees and it was a fun job to go to. I worked during the Halloween season so it was busy most of the time.
good,Exciting and fun working with staff. Never a dull moment working in a party store. Halloween is the best time of the year for the store.
good,"A typical day includes helping customers find what they need, restocking merchandise, and setting up new displays. "
good,"It was only temp Halloween work. Fast paced, helping people get their desired costumes. Down stocking and cleaning up at the end of the night."
good,"great work enviornment, great managment. the store was very control and in place. good hours and flexible schedule. learned a lot for this job about people and how to interact with costumes."
good,"A typical day at work would be usually to go in on time and get started immediately,I'v not only learn to become more humble but learned great communication skills.Management was really professional, organized and about strictly business.Co-workers were very respectful and focus on their job providing great customer service. The hardest part would be the customers being rude, but for the most part i enjoyed everything about the job ."
good,I was a good job while my time was there. its a good company and a great place for someone to work.jnnmgkfkfjjfjivjionodsnvonovnsovbovnkvnsovnsdovnodfvn
good,Productive work days. Always had a task to complete. Friendly workers and managers. Generous with work hours and flexible with scheduling.
good,the season was great i loved helping people with their parties and events but my job was definitely not the safe place my property was stolen by customers and my managers didn't not have protection on site
good,The most enjoyable part is that everyone got along and that made working here so much fun. The manager is the sweetest person ever and handle his employees like family.
good,A typical day at work would be assisting customers with merchandise. I learned that communication makes the team work. My co workers were very nice and so were the managers.
good,"As a Front End Supervisor my job requires processing tax exempt, returns, and assiting costumers as needed. My job also requires me to assist associates in day to day task. Everthing at work is challenging but I wouldn't consider anything hard. The most enjoyable part of my job are making the costumers happy."
good,"Great place to work at. Co-workers are amazing and its a very fun environment. Decent amount of hours, and the managers are amazing and know how to treat their workers right."
good,"This was my first job after high school. I was only a ""Seasonal Employe."" In the few months i worked at Party City i had a great time. My Co-workers were really nice to me and showed me how to run the store and what needed to be done daily. I worked with everyone to try and learn as much as i could. I showed up clocked in early and would stay late every day. Around the halloween time it was amazing they would give you the hours to get what you needed done."
good,Even for working just for a seasonal it was all in one package with having Halloween the best time to anyone to be who they want to be and also how they want to be.
good,"Doesn't give many hours and minimum wage unless a manager. Fun working there, you learn a lot, and meet different people."
good,"Opening the store was great and easy, I learned that everyone place a big role, in the stores money flow. If every ones is helping customer we are going to sell merchandise. My co- workers were great, they like selling and are very friendly to customer which in sells that's great why because our Customers are our money. The hard part is reading customer minds. It hard when they have many ideas and don't pick one. Customers satisfaction of course. Feeling the joy of the Customer when he/she find what they were looking for or even better we give them ideas."
good,"its great place to work, a fun place to show how good your customer service is. the pay wasn't very good but the work days were fun and interesting ."
good,"Very relaxed, easy going environment. It is seasonal and not full-time and I am looking for full time. Job and home life are able to be balanced and maintained at this position."
good,"It was Part City, my first job, of course I loved it. Fun time with my co-workers, got  a better opportunity so I left. Most enjoyable was Halloween being able to deal with everyone in their costumes."
good,"Meet and greet customers help with costume fitting direct to custumers desired place of items tell customer about sales to increase sales, restocked shelves , what I enjoyed about my job  the most is the people the customers made the day , my co-workers were the best we worked as a team , the hardest part of th job was telling a customer that we did not have his/her we didnt have their desired item, ive learned how to make the job alittle easier for me and my employees by taking a pen and paper and writing down numerous  costumes at a time."
good,"Great for a holiday job, very flexible hours"
good,i love working with halloween store very fun and productive lots of work and learning new things everyday my favorite store
good,"a typical day of work I would start my shift with putting back a cart of all of the days returns, after that i would ask my manager what projects needed to be done that day. The projects included things such as setting up a display and putting the products on it, moving stock, restocking, moving item displays to different areas of the store. using ladders to store things high up. i would do these projects, but i was also responsible for making sure anything out of place was put back in place, I helped customers, any task that was needed to be done I did. The hardest part of my job was if i was a cashier on a slow day. Just like any other task i was assigned, cashier had more tasks than just cashier, which I loved, you always had something to do, but on a slow day while cashier there was not much to be done, I would go out of my way to do things that were others jobs, because I would already have completed my tasks and no customers would be there, I do not like having down time while at my job. I want constant work, which is why i mostly was assigned to the floor because I am a fast and efficient worker. The most enjoyable part of the job came at halloween time. i originally started as a temp for halloween but they decided to keep me full time. At halloween, it was constant chaos, but i loved it because i was always running back and forth for people that wanted costumes. not to mention all of the messes and things people knocked down, it was actually a lot of fun to try to keep up."
good,On a daily interaction with customers as well as with co workers was the most enjoyable part of the job
good,I enjoyed communicating with all the different customers and my other employees and helping customers decide which theme to go with or what balloons would make the perfect centerpiece. I enjoyed helping my customers the most.
good,"I would either run the cash register or work the floor. The basic duties when running the cash register were: Helping customers' check out, helping customers' find what they're looking for, and recovering the front half of the store. The basic duties when working the floor were: showing customers' where something was, cleaning, and recovering the back half of the store. I learned a lot of customer services working here. I loved the people I worked for and my fellow co-workers. The hardest part of the job was Halloween season. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to go to work and have a good time doing my job,"
good,"This job really taught me to pay attention to detail. The appearance of the store was very important.  Cleanliness and recovery was a daily function for myself and my staff. Customer service was the key to success for our store.  Having the proper staff in place was the key to our customer service. Maintaining the staff and the product on the shelves made our store a success. Making goals daily, monthly and on a yearly basis with bonuses showed our success."
good,I LOVED working at Halloween City. Especially since it's my favorite time of year. It was wonderful for me to use my creativity and give input on costumes and help everyone out.
good,I had a wonderful working experience at Party city and wouldn't mind working for the corporation again. It was however hard to move up the ladder to a high job title.
good,"I loved coming to work at Halloween city, it was a fun job and helping customers find costumes they'd enjoy wearing was a blast! My co-workers were absolutely great to work with."
good,"poor management and training, i personally thought manager was a little racist and very arrogant"
good,"Every day at Party City is different, which is why I loved it there!  One day you could be cashiering all day and the next day you could be setting planograms all day. I learned how to multi-task here.  You have to be on top of your game at all times here, especially when it is busy.  Customer service is a top priority so the standard is set very high."
good,Great place to work but little opportunity for advancement
good,"Typical day at work is usually fun playful"
good,"During halloween I was in the back picking out costumes co workers needed."
good,Managing associates and setting planograms and seasons and taking in freight and throwing it out on the sales floor. Hardest part is dealing with the general manager.
good,"Great management and co-workers. Fun enviroment, had fun assisting customers on a daily basis."
good,"It is a fun job,everyone is very friendly and willing to help me in any way;management is very helpful in problem solving;co-workers are really fun orientated;we always have a good time;i have learned to communicate with co-workers in code and collaborate with ease;there really is not a hard part when you love what you do!"
good,Party City was a very good Company to work for. There was good growth opportunity.

good,while working their it was really great i enjoyed going to work everyday. the manager was great the the team where extrodinary
good,Great environment to get to know new people. Everyone that worked there was very friendly and hardworking.
good,I mostly cleaned and helped customers find what they were looking for. I helped unpack items and put them where they were suppose to do. I always walked by the aisles to make sure things were organized and in their place.
good,"The environment is fun but can be fast paced. Management is great, however I would recommend better training. The pay sucks, and even if you are considered full time, you don't get benefits until you are considered management."
good,Working at Party City was enjoyable overall. The job duties were easy and the pay reflected that. Management cares about its employees and will work with your schedule.
good,I really enjoyed my time at Party City and the staff were super supportive through training and assistance. They were understanding and on average the pace was comfortable. Most of my days were on cash and blowing balloons. Making children happy and assisting customers plan their party and gather material were always interesting parts of my day.
good,It was a great experience which allowed me to develop new skills and build better communication skills with the customer and with my coworkers and also help me become more independent
good,You get an overview of what you'll be doing\need to do in different areas.There's people around to tell you what you need to know if you forget and it's all repetitive.
good,it was a good job for beginning retail experience the hours are the only issue i had  there just wasn't enough hours offered. Most days i would only work four hours every few days.
good,"Party city is a good store to work at you get to learn new things they do there."
good,"I enjoyed my over all exspirence, although I've already worked in this field, I just wish I've made the cut of a permanent position with the company because I enjoyed working with you all company. Thank you Party City for the Opportunity."
good,"fun and flexible hours"
good,"I loved working at party city, it was my first job and I loved it . The people made it fun and I was always excited to go there and work. The managers are very nice and understanding."
good,"It was my first job and I highly recommend. It's fun, face-paced and very easy, the customers are always in a good mood. The conditions are good and the pay is average."
good,Working with people has always been my strong point. I will always enjoy working with people and helping them because that‚Äôs what I am good @. And party city is always looking for hard working people with good customer service skills.
good,"Un ambiente de trabajo execlente, buenos compa√±eros, buenos gerentes. Una segunda familia. Ambiente de trabajo seguro y c√≥modo. Nos gusta trabajar , es un lugar al que quieres ir a trabajar."
good,"Although a typical day during the holiday season consisted of a very busy workplace, the environment was fun and enjoyable. Employers were extremely understanding with school schedules."
good,It was a good seasonal job. It gets extremely busy during the holiday season (Halloween being the peak of the season). It will bring good money and pay for the time.
good,"I made new friends, I was still shy at the time so it was a little hard for me to get used to meeting and talking to new people. They checked up on us sometimes to see if we were okay. On my first day a mean old lady came up to me and yelled at me for giving her the wrong amount of change, even though I gave her the exact amount. I was scared but my trainer came to make sure I was okay right after she left. They treat you like family."
good,"It was a really fun place to work at especially around Halloween time, lots of fun. And a great place to meet new people as well. You are able to help people out with their choice of party supplies or balloons or costumes."
good,"I miss working here so much I loved coming into work and being able to unleash my creativity, had so much fun pricing items,building plan O grams, assembling walls and styling costumes for display. I felt like a Halloween designert!(is that a thing? lol) while also getting to wear costume accessories and decorate my work table. I mainly worked in the fitting rooms which was awesome, I made a best friend there and really miss her and everyone else. we were all super close. I was able to  train another girl my second year and it was really cool. I also enjoyed being able to fix broken or damaged items in my downtime it made me feel crafty. I made quite a few big sales and was offered a position for the following year. All my Coworkers and managers were seriously awesome. even bought us lunch a few times. it never felt like work and was super easy. i'd do again in a heartbeat! the only downfall is when i tried to apply for the 3rd year they didn't hire me and claimed I had problems the previous year but it turned out to be someone else they were referring to!"
good,"I worked at Party City for a year and eight months and honestly I was promoted pretty quick, lack of management was the biggest issue and as well how drama guides that store. It‚Äôs nearly impossible and also the woman or vibe of at least two party city usually lays in a sexist domination. Honestly I can tell you party city was great but the hours can be cut, and so can you, depending. On how much you can handle"
good,Party City Corporation was a positive work environment; offered an opportunity to learn and expand customer service and sales skills. Followed company policies with respect towards all associates and customers.
good,"I enjoyed saturday mornings the most, that's when we had a large number of balloon orders and we'd have to get so many done before opening. Never a dull moment. Just an exciting workplace with great coworkers. Management was super encouraging and trained well. I learned to be more outspoken and creative at this job."
good,"I fully enjoy working at PArty cit, however, the pay is low and often gives little hours, this leads to small bi-weekly paychecks which are hard to manage as a college student"
good,I enjoyed my time at Party City and i‚Äôm glad i got a chance to work there with great management and coworkers. I worked there for a little under a year and it has been a journey that i‚Äôve learned a lot from and i‚Äôm grateful for that.
good,"The employees were extremely competent. Management and supervisors were professional, reliable and kind. "
good,Definitely my favorite job i have ever had. So sad my location closed and no full time positions were available to transfer to. The only time it‚Äôs hard is if you are in school or have a family to get home to during the month of October (for obvious reasons.)
good,"Great workplace .. fast paced and challenging.. fun exciting place to work "
good,"Working at party city was the best experience. The staff I worked with was very professional, fun, optomistic, encouraging and helpful. Working at party city really was a party. They knew how to keep the staffed entertained, but still hard working. They kept the atmosphere very fun and light"
good,Working at Halloween city was honestly the best job I have had so far. The environment was amazing everyone got along very well and hours were flexible and were enough to get a good paycheck. Working there was always the best because mostly everyone who walked in always left with a smile and a product they need.
good,The people were nice and friendly always so upbeat the manger was great i enjoyed working because we all had equal opportunity to do everything threw out the store the Coustmers were very pleasant to deal with
good,"Its a very fun place to work but can also be stressful as to how busy it is. You will be moving all over the place. Blowing up a lot of balloons, cashiering and customer service skills are a must. I loved being here and was sad a bit to leave but i had better opportunities else where. The store staff was amazing made many life long friends and just had a great time."
good,clock in receive instructions stock merchandise where necessary clean facilities and store aisles as needed restock merchandise where needed enjoyed working during halloween
good,"Everyone was super nice and helpful all the managers were respectful the jobs werent really hard and if there was something I didn‚Äôt know it was very to ask "
good,Fun and Productive work enviorment made it a enjoyable place to work. Although many times we may had upset customers unhappy with certain situations I do believe good yet strong customer service skills are much needed as well as plenty patience.
good,"This was a seasonal job for me. There was action everywhere because it was close to Halloween, but the managers are niec and they work with you. Not to many complaints here"
good,"A typical work day at party city would start off by me walking to the back getting my vest and clocking in.But i usualy would come in after school and would work from 3-12 and around that time is when they were the busiest. We would have people come in wanting to set up for parties, wanting candy or just to get stuff for a prank. But a days work at Party city would go by fast because ther was alwas something to do and the faculty mad working even better. every day that id come in id start sweeping and a co-worker wouldcome up and tell a jokejut to make the day go by."
good,"Everyone was so friendly, and all worked together. Overall, it was a great experience. It was pretty calm and sometimes empty. We were always busy doing something regardless of how many people were in the store."
good,"Learned alot advanced with help and hard work friendly coworkers great teamwork alot of hours great atmosphere"
good,This was honestly the most fun i have had at any location that i worked for. There was always a story to tell with a customer or some crazy situation that was fun to create a solution to. I remember a customer called and wanted pirate themed items for a family treasure hunt. He spent over 700 on items for his family. Sweet!
good,"A place where you could work and be yourself, making many new friends. Everyone seemed to get along great and having it end seemed to soon. I only wish i could of spent more time with the people their. The manager was great, always nice and cheerful. got her work done and promoting a positive attitude i believe helped the store more than just writing down our duties and leaving it at that."
good,"I had a great time working at Party City. "
good,Very flexible hours and understanding management. Always something to do but rarely stressful. Can be well paid. Would recommend as a workplace.  Very relaxed.
good,"Greeting all incoming customers with a warm hello "
good,"This job was my first job, and in my opinion it was great. My boss was the coolest, very nice and easygoing and always looking out for his employees. My coworkers were great as well, aside from one, but not everything can be perfect. The store didn‚Äôt get busy until about three or four days before Halloween, and it was a total nightmare. But we handled it. I honestly wish my Halloween City had made it to a Christmas store, I felt at home there."
good,"Work I good, its a seasonal job, cool employees, nice customers, great place to work for a seasonal job, you see a lot of different styles of costumes and interesting stuff"
good,"I actually worked at Halloween City, and it was one of the most fun experiences. The team their were always fun to work with. Management was awesome and everyone was always happy and upbeat."
good,"Fast paced environment , fine place to work, very upbeat customers."
good,great place to work for students. Usually very laid back. Only gets busy around Halloween time. Management was pretty good. Very flexible hours. Honestly pretty fun to work there.
good,Fun place to work. I worked there as a seasonal position around Halloween. The seasonal hours are later so some nights I was working until 11pm. I really liked working there
good,When I worked at party city I was happy it was a good job to start my career  it was friendly there no drama at all .. the place was clean Always self stalked it was a good place too work at..
good,This was a fun and fast paced job. We started two weeks before the store opened and built all the displays and stocked all merchandise. We did inventory and packaged all remaining merchandise after the store closed for the season.
good,The staff and management were excellent. I absolutely loved going to work. I laughed so much and I wish it wasn't just seasonal. The pay could've been better though.
good,My managers were great and my co-workers were enjoyable to be around. Party City is a great place for job experience. The environment is pleasant and comfortable.
good,"Party City gave me a chance while I was in HS, and the opportunity allowed me to learn about sales and customer service. I had flexible hours .  It‚Äôs a great place to start."
good,"The managers are great and extremely friendly to associates. The work environment is fun, especially if you have an enjoyment for the Halloween season! The people are friendly, and it's fun to get to know the customers style and preferences when helping to choose/create costumes and home decorations."
good,Great Co-workers and management make the atmosphere here great. Work here is fun and although the customers are never quite so you get a few that brighten up your day. From cleaning to ringing a customer through the till there will rarely be a dull moment until closing.
good,"Had a good experience, lot of activities to choose from, learned a lot more skills like balloons and making costumes. Enjoyed working with customers and new people. Also loved the environment and all the people I met and became friends with"
good,"A typical day at work for me, would consist of approaching guests, interacting with the as well as my team members, also checking over the store to see that things are getting done as needed."
good,"I loved working for Party City! While I was in the process of becoming a Party City employee, a sweet young man told me that ""We're a family here."" I felt so welcomed and appreciated by all. The manager, when I called the store to ask about if they had any openings, just told me to come into an interview. Without Submitting an application at first. Everyone's so kind I loved it!"
good,"I got hired for Halloween and it was very hectic, but the management made sure to keep it as organized as possible to make it easier on the employees and the customers. I learned how to use a cash register and how to work under stressful situations. Management was amazing. I enjoyed working for them. The most enjoyable part of the job were the employees and management. It felt like a little family there, even though I was there for a short period of time. They make everything easier and it makes working there fun."
good,"I would love too have the opportunity to work their part time or full time but only seasonal empoyment is ever needed. Fun environment too work at, especially at halloween."
good,"It was a fun place to work and I had a blast working there. The stores in Dallas were franchise stores and the owner was a blast to work with, but we did so good the company purchase the stores and then they lets all go for there managers"
good,"The employees are extremely welcoming and very understanding. It is a fun environment with respectful co-workers and hard workers. I was trained on cash register and the woman who trained me was very understanding to the many mistakes I made, and always told me that I will get the hang of it with time. The employees are very respectful and kind to their customers."
good,It was a very fast-paced job experience and a bit stressful. But it was very do-able. The managers were helpful too and the co-workers are usually young people but very helpful.
good,"I enjoyed my time working for this company.  They train well. They offer guidance.  They had a great culture, which inspired everyone to give their all."
good,It was fun seen a lot of different people all ages. Cool coworkers. Keeps you on your feet. The worse part was closing time we would have to organize the isles. The best part was getting to meet new people and the staff was awesome. Flexible hours.
good,"I started working at Party City just out of high school because I needed to find a job. When I first got there I was a Halloween Temp. I wasn't guaranteed a full position after the holiday since they already had so many people. But I worked as hard as I could to prove that I wanted to stay and work there. "
good,This is a great job to begin with especially if your working seasonal. you learn to work under pressure as well as learning to be organized. the coworkers are great and will make sure you work as a team
good,Hearing customers thank you for the look of store associate service. In out fast service.  My store team at like a team and not team individuals. Good/fun place to work at and associates to work with.
good,"Its a really great beginners job, but since theirs no room for promotions. The workers are very nice, most times you will be picking up the slack for other workers though."
good,A day working at Party City is cut-throat I worked on the costume wall most of the time and had to interact with customers all day. I also did stocking in store and in our backrooms. I handle fitting rooms sometimes to make sure nobody was stealing from the store. I enjoyed the stocking in backrooms and in store mostly. I learned how to move everything into our warehouse as well.
good,"The hiring process was very easy, management was a breeze to deal with. Co-workers were friendly, which allowed me to learn the job a lot faster. I would take orders over the phone, and place orders at the register, I would unpack merchandise and stock the shelves. Closing shift would clean the store. (Wipe counters, registers, sweep, mop, clean bathrooms, take the garbage out, etc.)"
good,"Often help customers plan birthday parties or any other party they have an idea for. Doing ballon orders could get stressful if you get them mixed up. Also, they tend to add up if you aren't on top of it."
good,"It was a clean and friendly workplace. I enjoyed pulling costumes and working as an associate. Especially during the Halloween season. I learned that you have to work as a team, even on the busiest days. The hardest part was to get all of the customers their items before the season is over. I'll recommend this job to anyone because of the atmosphere."
good,Halloween City was extremely fun because we were allowed to wear the costumes. The employees were all helpful we all worked as a team everyday. It is a seasonal job that a lot more people should tryout.

good,Yhe wasn't a day I didn't wanna come to work the customers are great and the employees are amazing . A lot of the merchandise we deal with are part supplies. It felt like every day I came to work to help plan party's. Having fun and being creative and providing the customers with great service.
good,the customers were always happy and the employees were so nice and the managers were so nice and its a lot of fun place to work at during the Halloween season.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was that I got to interact with customers. It was enjoyable helping others finding there needs and wants. Management was awesome!

good,I enjoyed working here because there was always something new going on. Each quarter brought new merchandise to promote. The staff was friendly and very polite. Great place to work.
good,"A typical day at work would involve clocking in at the start of your shift. Then going into the back office and grabbing a radio. Then you would immediately get to work and get whatever needed to be done, done all within a timely manner. I learned a lot about retail while working there. I learned how to handle money, stock shelves, down stock, how to greet customers in a friendly way. The management at Party City was great. They always worked well with their employees and were always so nice. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy boxes every time we got freight. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with all the other wonderful employees and creating life long friendships with your coworkers."
good,I have never enjoyed a job like I enjoyed working here. Such a friendly environment with flexible schedules and great management. The people at this corporation have all become such an impact on my life.
good,A seasonal worker day at work would be coming in and going directly to your post. I learn patience and how to work a register. Most of the managers were great people.
good,I did a temp for halloween. If you're good they keep you. Lots of fun if you have the right management and sales team support behind you. Dont be lazy and youll have a good time.
good,"I enjoyed working there nice people, and easy to catch on to things. The customers are friendly and nice to get along with."
good,"i loved every minute of this job. yes you were busy, however who doesnt love balloons, candy, party stuff?? its a great job. blew up balloons made different ways of arranging them. outcomes were awesome. made so many people happy.. who could be sad at a party store."
good,It is a very lively place to be and to do your job. It is a great experience as well being a team member being able to help those in need. The store was very easy to analyze and figure every spot of anything.
good,Excellent DM who was incredibly supportive and encouraging.   Management was understanding and flexible while efficient and adhered to company guidlines
good,It was pretty awesome working at party city for the Halloween season. I always wondered what it was like because I figured it was super busy...so getting a taste of that was a real treat. My co-workers were great and thru my time there truly memorable!
good,The work enviroment was fun and laid back. interacting with the costumers was great expirence. my co workers where easy to get along with and i love the fast pace of it all
good,Only thing that Party City Can Change is there hours and the rate of pay. It is a very grate place of employment. The hours are cut really bad after Halloween.
good,The employees are great and clean and respectful i loved working here had to stock and run cShier watch customers help customers and handle the fitting room and always be happy smile and be happy . fast work pace and keep store clean at all times
good,"This was a fast pace job with so much fun times. It allowed me to get creative with the customers (ie: helping them plan their big events, making balloon bouquets for birthdays, valentines day, grad parties and mothers day)"
good,I had a wonderful experience. They day was enjoyable and would go by quickly. my co-workers would make my day and enjoy the work hours.
good,I really enjoyed working there even though the seasonal job is over the second week of November. Overall I had a good time working there with friendly people and I learned alot in the short time I worked there.
good,Party City was a great place to work for. My first job it was fun!  I learned a lot from my co workers and how to conduct myself inside a work place. I grew fast in the time I worked at party City
good,"I only worked seasonal there during Halloween. During my time there, all the employees helped my perform my job more efficiently."
good,"Party City was my very first job, and I enjoyed every bit of my time working there. The managers were fun to be around and my co-workers consisted of people that I would grow to call my friends later on in life. Busy season was a blast. It's the perfect job for teenagers looking to take their first steps into the job life."
good,This was one of my first jobs and I had a excellent experience working here. The managers and supervisor was always helpful made sure you understand what u task was for the day and it was always a fast paced work place and met new customers and assisted them in any kind of way that you could
good,Party City was a nice place to work. The people I worked with are amazing. The store was always ready. The Company was a great company to work for. Over all its a food starting job for to learn.
good,"Working with party city has been a truly great experience. There is so much to know about stocking, customer service, and basic work place skills."
good,I loved working here. I started off as a sells associate an with in 2 weeks I was assistant manager. it was super easy to move up the ladder there. I enjoyed every day working there. I hope to some day live closer to another one so I can grab me a job working there again. I highly recommend this job to anyone looking for a temp job.
good,"Overall it was a whatever. The managers at the establishment only gossiped on the headphones, talked about other employees and did work when they knew the store was filled with customers and the associates were over worked for little compensation."
good,"Party City was probably the best job I ever had, it's a shame it was only seasonal. Management always kept track of when employees were to go on break even though I personally don't think that they had to do that for us. Management was always able to answer questions when employees were unsure about something. Not too difficult of a job, typical day was walking up and down aisles putting merchandise back in the right place and helping customers find what they needed. Overall very positive experience. The one small problem was that for some of the busier aisles merchandise would be moved around so sometimes it was a little harder to help customers find what they were looking for, but it didn't provide too much difficulty."
good,"Great store to work at. Managers are super helpful at all times. Theres always something to do, theres always a customers to help. Easy going job, co-workers are easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is cleaning and putting returns back. I enjoyed working here all together. I go back every season."
good,I worked for Party City for 7 Years. It truly is a party store. You have to keep up with the season. They change over to new Holladay with in 24 hours so if you like to move all the time it's is your job. Halloween is there big season. The planners come in weekly you have to keep up with that. Balloons count for 40% of sales. It can really be stressful if you do not plan a head. As for moving up in the company they mostly promote from with in. After a year I was training to be a Dist manager. I was a DM for 5 years then move to LP. Pay is avg with in retail but very good  bonuses.
good,I love working for Party City but it is a part time position.  The management has taught me all the aspects of working for the company so I can move to any position at any store.  This is a great environment and an outstanding 1st job for anyone looking to get off to a great start in the work force.
good,"I worked a seasonal job for Halloween City and loved every minute of it. The training is almost nonexistent but the work is pretty easy to catch onto, and the environment was pretty relaxed. I loved all of my managers, and they were the kind to TELL you that you were doing a good job. They also had great, constructive ways of telling you how you could improve. Hours were very flexible, and as it got closer to the holiday, you were welcome to stay for some extra hours. So if you're willing to put in the work, it's there! I'd work here again in a second."
good,"I loved my job at Halloween city. The managers were amazing and extremely comfortable and kind. They listened to my concerns and ideas and gave me the freedom and trust to advance in my career. "
good,In this job I get to be creative. Helping customers with costumes was the best part of this job. Especially working with children. They keep a very positive vibe at all times.
good,"Worked consisted of stocking shelves with merchandise each day and displaying the merchandise in a presentable, simplified layout  for the benefit of customers. I learned how to organize the merchandise into appropriate sections based on which target markets the store meant to sell to; I also learned how to use a cash register for the first time, which was much more simple than I expected. Management was pleasant on average except in times of store rushes. The co-workers were lively and responsible people who did their jobs as needed. The hardest part of the job was to deal with store rushes. The most enjoyable part of the job was walking down the isles and looking at the variety of costumes that the store had to sell."
good,"This company was great to work for, a lot of fun loving employees and awesome managers. every day i looked forward to going to work."
good,constantly had opportunities to advance in this job. Management was great at training employees and helping them to succeed. Coworkers was respectful and pleasant to work with
good,I loved working at party city because everyone functioned like a good team and we all got along. Working there was always easy going and i really enjoyed the work.
good,"Typical day is being constantly busy in a fun company culture."
good,"On any given shift I would fold napkins and polish silver wear."
good,A typical day at work is a normal work ethic day were responsibilities are taking care of. While working in an environment with customers their are always going to be a challenge that you experience at your  job all the time. Managers and co workers are people that you have to maintain on your everyday bases. Weather its working as a team or following directions. The hardest part of the job is not always striving for your goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that everyday I come to relish a challenge.
good,"When I worked at Petco, I would organize shelves, clean up the isles, sort through the stock room, and help out customers that needed help looking for something. I enjoyed working at Petco because it was my first job."
good,"This job does very outstanding work when it comes to customers. Provides excellent quality, awesome communication skills and great sales. A typical day at work would be calm and employees getting there work done as of a busy day would be during the holidays. Manager is always there when you need him if needed to be contact will answer on a call no matter what it is. The hardest part of the job will be if you didn't understand what you job you were suppose to do it and get things done late. The most enjoyable part of the job is most of the time everyone gets along so we have talks now and then and are happy to be a work."
good,I worked during the halloween season and just had to help people choose their costumes.
good,it was amazing and it as its days but awsome job. it was a great experioence the co-workers were very responsible and understandinmg and funny people.
good,"I love working for this company. I have been here for 2 years and I don't stay in one place. I am either cashiering, helping customers or cleaning the store. I've learned that teamwork, communication and having good employees makes the job more worthwhile. Management is excellent. They are understanding and are always willing to work with you. The hardest part of my job would be satisfying every customer even when you don't carry the product in the store or online. Then they don't get that great customer satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of my job would be when the employees and the customers are all happy with their day and that the day goes smoothly."
good,"Typical day at work consisted of helping shoppers out, being in the sales floor, and being at the cashier. Mondays are consisted of taking the items to the floor from the large freight that comes in. Saturdays are always the busiest day of the week. There were balloons needed to blown up with helium and that made the difficult to walk around back of the cashiers. Overall a god experience"
good,"i learned everything in KFC. how to became a good follower and a leader."
good,"You are expected to autonomously check in, grab your radio, and man your post at either the costume wall, or the back room, to ensure that everyone gets their costume in ten seconds or less.  Management was focused on keeping work moving and maintaining a fun environment for the employees and customers.  Co-workers were fun to work with.  The hardest part was the massive traffic approaching the holiday, and sending off orders in rapid succession.  The most enjoyable part was a 30% discount on everything in the store, and the laid back environment."
good,"I enjoyed working here, staff was great, management was even better. Only downside of management, was a little lack of communication here and there, however, I would definitely work for them again. Just with more hours and a higher pay."
good,"I managed this tempory store for 4 seasons, the company was great to work for the DMs and RMs where very helpful in everyway. I hired and trained the complete staff. The store didn't open in Hermitage in 2013 and there were no other opening in the area for this company."
good,It was very fun .we got to wear costumes. everyone was so friendly.
good,"A typical day includes being a cashier, blowing up balloons for different types of parties and cleaning the store. I've learned that you have to be able to work with others for certain projects to get finished. Also how important being nice to the customer is. Management is very helpful and laid back. The hardest part of the job is keeping all of the customers happy. The most enjoyable part is my co-workers; I try my best to have fun with anyone and everyone I have to work with."
good,"Learned mostly planograms, setting up floor displays with any type of product. Being able to flex out empty product for another type to fill in empty spaces in store. Stocking, up stocking, down stocking, new product to old."
good,"A typical day for me was cleaning up the stores and assisting customers with finding the right size costume or make up for the costume. One thing i did learn was a better level of customers service no matter what the situation. My manager is actually a friend of mine so most of the management was fine, however there were a couple of my coworkers that did absolutly nothing to help out around the store. The hardest part of my job was staying calm when i had a line around the store of customers waiting to check out. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing happy customers walk out of the store."
good,"working at halloween city was alot of fun it gave me a sense of what working in retail is like, and im thankful for the experience"
good,"Fun work environment. Always a chance to get more hours."
good,"Party City is an enjoyable company. Always welcoming you with smiles, and ideas for your next celebration."
good,"Started as a seasonal helper and was hired on permanently. Very fun place to work, we were allowed to dress up and and talk to customers. There were 2-3 managers working a single shift so it was hard to work with one manager asking for you to do one thing and another manager asking for you to do something different."
good,Party City is a very fun and professional place to work. Always good customer service. Nice and professional management and co-workers. I enjoyed being at work everyday.
good,"Party City is an enjoyable place to work because of all the party favors and being able to assist customers with there upcoming parties making sure they have the best of the best! I loved working here and learned many things such as teamwork, customer service skills, and cashier skills."
good,A typical day at party city is basicly bringing the new stock to the floor and inventory. I learned how to greet customers the proper way and how to stock products. Management was great taught me alot. Hardest part of the job is making sure you put the right product in the correct spot other then that it wasn't really challenging. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with customers.
good,Just a temporary job but a nice fun place to work at. I enjoyed it and wouldn't mind going back next Halloween! :)
good,"I love working for this company since I have almost worked for them now 3 years and going. The managers, assistant managers, team leads, and my co-workers are amazing to work with."
good,"This was my first job that was not related to education/teaching. I thought it was interesting to deal with children and their parents in that environment, understanding their needs as well as frustrations when trying to find costumes or other party items and just dealing with the demands of all the customers at the same time. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to make a child's 'dream come true' as far as creating the look or character they wanted to be for Halloween."
good,"however the job is only seasonal, I enjoyed my time there. I learned how to manage a staff quickly,and get my employee's comfortable working in the field. The hardest part of the job was cleaning up the mess customers made after we close down the store. Having only a few staff to help you vacuum and pick up the garbage left behind can be a real hassle. But is manageable."
good,very relaxed and chill. can wear costumes whenever you want. get to see all the new products that come in!
good,This job was always fun. this was my first job and it was so fun i always stayed busy and I always meet new people. the managers we so nice down to earth and the respected us as a person as did we. the hardest part of this job was holloween there are so many customers at one time. everyday i was there was enjoyable
good,It's a great additude place; where they teach you how to work in a certain area. You build the place together with the team u work with and this makes the team stronger. You have people u can rely on and new people u can meet.
good,Working here was a great expierence other then typical work problems everything was fine. I was alomost made a supervisor somethings got in the way. I could honestly say i loved it there
good,i worked there for the halloween season all the costums they had were great i liked it cause of helping the customers and the people and dressing up was fun to do all day every day fun and loveing job to have they have all ur party needs one stop shop at party city
good,"Excellent seasonal job , fun and productive place to work ,management team was very helpful to each other, would work there again , it was a very good learning experience"
good,"I have worked for Halloween city for two years....I love it.Alot of work,but sooo much fun,I had a great staff...I hope to do it this year.."
good,I used to love working for party city until I caught the GM of the stores talking bad about me to my co workers.
good,"This was my first job. They taught me how to be courteous and helpful to customers so that they will always return to buy from us again. The managment team was great, as were the associates. We always kept a friendly feel to the store."
good,Party City was my 1st job that I had. I learned alot balancing work and going to High School.
good,I worked at Halloween city will I was expecting a child. It was a great place to work while saving up for having a baby. It was great to learn and grow in the management part of the job. I had a great experience overall and continue to put what I learned into other management jobs.

good,"Fast pace and fun atmosphere to work in, flexible hours. Enjoyed working closely with customers, assisting them with their important party-planning needs."
good,"While working here at Party City, I enjoyed the atmosphere and the customers that came in, working with each one individually to figure out their needs. Management there worked with their associates and never discriminated, and the hardest part of the job there would probably be the cashiering and blowing up balloons. I learned how to manage my time effectively while working there."
good,working at party city was a blast.The teamwork was the best ive ever worked with.when i worked there i was expecting to be working full time but only ended up working seasonally.
good,"it‚Äôs not a bad job at all, you can get plenty of work done, and also you‚Äôll enjoy making balloons. Party City is a good working environment and you will be satisfied working there."
good,"Party City was a great starting job for me, It was a seasonal position but I learned a lot in the few months I was there. The managers communicated really well and the employees were very close together, The work wasn't hard at all and the hours were flexible."
good,Working there was really fun. Yes it was a comfortable setting but when you had to get serious you would. They pay good and give a fair amount of hours.
good,"Everybodys nice, calm and respectful.  It's easy to learn and everybodys willing to help if you get stuck. It can get hectic at times but it never stays that way long."
good,It‚Äôs a good place to work. Management is nice as well as the customers. There are two things you should know while working here. During the month of October as it got closer to Halloween the store stayed open longer. And the second is to check the schedule to make sure you know when you work.
good,Amazing management able to ask for help when needed if struggling ask for help and they will not hesitate and amazing team work together to accomplish things

good,"Always was kept busy, and the pay isn‚Äôt bad for a sales Associate. The only thing i wish i had was more hours. If i could have a lot more hours then i would be happy"
good,"The experience is what you expect of a retail gig, working the register, stocking the shelves, cleaning up messes and so on. This company does treat its workers right and if you don't mind dealing with customers over balloons then there's really nothing wrong with this job."
good,"I enjoyed working at party city but, it was classified of many different things from customer services, to working the registers, to being on the floor especially during the Halloween season. many times the bosses and employees had clicks like back in high school."
good,overall can't complain. it is a friendly work place and a great place to start in the work force. and they are willing to work with your schedule if you are in school have two jobs. its more or a family and a home other than co-workers and a job
good,"I go in Happy ready to work , ask or look for work that‚Äôs not completed , complete the work learn something new that day at work , the hardest part is climbing on ladder to top stock and organize it. The best part I love about the job is making friends and turning them into family and getting our job done."
good,I loved how flexible and understanding my team was. They boosted my resume and really gave me some great opportunities for advancement. I would love to continue to be a part of this team!
good,"Even though some pople do not learn alot on thier first day, you will eentually know where eveything is and how to properly work in the workplace. The manager is pretty chill and nice, even though you only have 30 minute breaks, they go by pretty quick so just watch the time close."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was everyone you work with was super nice and friendly so it wasn't hard to get along with people, and also it was an easy job to accomplish. They didn't ask to much of you and let you decide between 15 - 30 minute breaks. They'd also sometimes buy food/drinks for everyone to share. It was like a second home."
good,I would personally say myself that party city is the best part-time place to work. management was so nice the hours were so flexible and they really made sure that you were taken care of as a person
good,"Even though Halloween City was a small pop-up shop where I lived I had a great time working there. It was well managed, fun, interactive, and most of all it was great help learning on how to communicate with customers"
good,It was a really fun experience for a temporary job. All managers where really great and respectful. Does include alot of interactions with different types of customers.
good,Learned something new everyday and also got promoted to management very quick. Working there was great. It was a fine environment and a good experience.
good,"Honestly was a great fast paces environment however, some days could be slow busiest times were Halloween. I do recommend working here especially as a first job i only wish pay was allot better but i enjoyed it.  My tip for you work hard!!"
good,party city was an great place to work nothing about it was hard but there where some things that weren't easy but at the end all you need to know is focus on your money
good,"Amazing workplace, amazing environment. You learn all the basic retails skills like cashier, recovering, inventory and many more skills. Great for improving your communication and leadership skills."
good,This job was a lot of fun and we got to dress up in costumes particularly when it got closer to Halloween. I started as just a part time and advanced to a management position where I got many hours at two different stores. Both of the general managers loved me and scheduled me as much as I would work. It was a lot of work but there was also plenty of time for fun as well. Customers could be hard to deal with at times because there is a No Return Policy. A lot of kids will come in to play around also.
good,In the process of being an overnight stocker at Party City. It consist of variety procedures. Stocking fright at high rate pace. Label coordinating also sorting of fright.
good,I would recommend working here but it is a seasonal job. If you are looking to get some quick money for a month or 2 this is the job for you. Also you get paid in a Visa card form. So you receive a card in the mail and they reload money on to it. Its like a check but you swipe!
good,Working at Party city was a very easy job. It was a seasonal job aso they let me go once october was over i had fun working there for that month because I would help customers find costumes.
good,"Working at Party City was an amazing experience. The coworkers are really nice, as well as my managers. My managers understand that I have a personal life, so they are always happy to accommodate my needs. The hours aren't great, but it's good enough for a part time."
good,"the store ran beautifully, the staff and leadership worked and got along well. leadership taught me how to handle staff without being a tyrant. This job was a great learning experience."
good,"This was my very first job and it taught me so many things! I learned how to provide excellent customer service, how to work a cash register, and other basic work requirements. It was fun helping people make decoration plans for different occasions."
good,"I helped customers locate items, answered customer questions regarding Party City goods and services, use selling techniques to recommend products, and arrange merchandise on store shelves."
good,"this was a fun place to work, the hours were sometimes not scheduled correctly and the hours are scattered  but over all working with management and the team were a great experience."
good,It's was really a fun place to work it didn't feel like wotk when you love what you do in fact if they were still hiring I would love to work again I only wish it was more than just a seasonal or temp job but a permanent
good,"I liked working here. There were interesting people and it was a calm environment. It got a little crazy around Halloween but, nothing I couldn't handle."
good,"It was fun to work here during the Halloween season, and there are many different skills they teach you. Quickly and efficiently working tills as it is very busy and customer service."
good,This is a good starter job. the experience helped me improve my customer service and step outside my comfort zone. This job is the step and stone until you figure out your career.
good,"Working at Party City was great. When I would come in, I would be greeted by my associates and my manager. My manager would tell me what had to be done for the day and then leave me to complete the tasks, which I loved. The hardest part of the job would be the size of the staff. There were not many employees at any time, except the holidays, so completing some tasks did take some time, but nothing I could not handle. The best part working for Party City was being able to talk to customers about the things they were buying. They would tell me all about the awesome parties they were setting up for, some for birthdays others for companies."

good,Great and fun job. People there were kind and helpful. The hours given for fit for my schedule and good. Made many friends. Great job for beginners. It is seasonal and fun.
good,"Overall I had lots of fun working there, before working there I had no work experience. Not only were my managers and coworkers friendly, but they were willing to help me grow with them and obtain skills to help me help them. Everytime I walked in the store, I would always feel my stress and worries leave cause I knew a fun time was to be had not only cause it was party city but because I enjoyed helping those that needed help celebrating good and memorable times. Managers bend over backwards with work most of the time and that shouldn't unnoticed, they sacrifice so much to support the store. They gave me confidence to keep thriving even when I was done, they showed that they appreciated all I contributed and I do not regret working there one bit."
good,One of the best placed to work - its only temporary but I would return year after year! It was a great crowd of people.  Family owned and they made you feel like you were family also! I loved it.  Miss it every Halloween I am not back!

good,"I loved working at party city. The job is great for students and first-time jobs.They worked with my hours since I had doctors appointments and school schedules. I was always learning new information. On the job, you are always meeting new people, that you get to know from different backgrounds. This makes the job interesting if you ask and get to know the customers that come in. Once you on that level than they come back. Halloween is most definitely the hardest part of the job but also the most enjoyable. I say this because everyone is tired by the end of long hours. Once you see the children walking around in their costumes your heart melts. Sometimes it is also the adults that just make you laugh."
good,Really loved my time with the company. I gained many skills in retail and stock. Management was helpful and gave opportunity. Would definitely work here again. A+++

good,Was a temporary seasonal position. Was very rewarding during that short time. Had fun with all of the costumes helping customers find the right costume.
good,It was a hectic job being a halloween specialist. There were kids and parents everywhere choosing costumes and throwing things on floor. You have to be quick on your feet and there is always something to do. The fun thing is you get to wear a costume while doing it.
good,"Work for them for 10yrs, relaxed atmosphere to work in. The owner was outstanding, on hand with his employees and expected 100% form his workers.  Fast paced environment , but rewarding."
good,"Fun to work very colorful energetic friendly environment independent sometimes friendly customers. It's a fun environment to work in as far as retail goes. The pay is minimum wage, so if you're looking for a job to pay rent I would recommend looking elsewhere"
good,"First Job was here during Halloween, busiest time for them. Great atmosphere, wonderful coworkers/managers theyre like family to me. Only left because my husband is in the military. If you ever worked in retail its a really easy job. If you love helping people like I do you will enjoy planning events and birthdays with the customers."
good,A typical day at work was very easy and there was never much to do until the holiday Halloween came along. All I had to do was help the customers find whatever they needed and follow the manager's orders.

I meet a lot of fun people who shop for there party supplies and look forward to Halloween again this year!  Can't work for a happier place! If I had to do it all over again, I definitely would."

good,Typical work days have consistency and strong structure. Responsibilities are set and distributed day to day. It is very fast pace employment and must be eager to learn new way to do simple projects.
good,Everyday at Party City is a Party. It was a fun work environment. I learned a lot of social skills and learned how things were set up. Management was very understanding and the co-workers were very friendly. The hardest part of the job was leaving because I was a temp.

good,fun and enjoyable environment. everyone is very nice and its a good work area. the pay isnt half bad and the management is run very well.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of interacting with all sorts of people, being friendly, sweep and just convince people to buy different items. What I have learned working here would be to become more customer friendly and have more of an open mind when dealing with things. The management was pretty fair and easy going.

During our open hours, I assisted customers, rung them out on the cash register, straightened merchandise, and helped any employee who needed it. The hardest part of the job was telling customers we didn't have the costume they were looking for. I enjoyed hearing the intricate ideas of homemade costumes, and being around the excited people."
good,"fun job liked a lll of my employee, pay was minimum wage, and the hours wee not great"

good,Working at Halloween City was a blast! The days went by fast because there was always something to do.
good,"I really enjoyed working with co workers and my manager at Halloween City. I learned from my manager that working at Halloween City is the only place where you can dress up in a costume without getting in trouble. Co-workers I worked with were very friendly and very fun to be around with when we close. We always worked as a team during store hours and after closing when we clean. I never had a problem with any associates or managers while I worked there. The hardest part of the job is the fitting rooms at the time. It was hard to keep track of what costume the customer(s) were trying on because we had 6 fitting rooms and a long line. Asking the customer to leave their bags outside the fitting rooms was hard to do because most customers would be upset, change their mind, and leave."
good,Everyone LOVES halloween time even myself! Great place to work at espically if you are on the creative side. Because this is when your creative skills really come out helping a customer out when helping them find that perfect and awesome halloween costume!

good,This was my first job and it was the best job i have ever had. Working here is so fun and the staff is amazing.
good,Shame it was only seasonal. I really liked all my co-workers and bosses. Hours weren't THAT great. Most enjoyable part of the job was trying on costumes after all the costumers have left.
good,"At Halloween City we helped the customers find what they wanted for a party/ Halloween. All the coworkers got along, we never had someone complain about someone else."
good,the hardest part is when people havent had heir coffee they are very cranky.
good,i love working for the company. I was always on point on getting all the paperwork done.
good,"My typical day at work would be assisting customers to items that they cannot find in the store, explaining to customers about our different balloon options, working out boxes that came to our store. I have learned from Party City to communicate more efficiently to customers when they are confused about something and how to handle a not so pleasant customers, I have also learned how to set plan-o-grams for the different holidays throughout the year. All the management at Party City are wonderful to work with. The manager will work with my schedule for school very well. I also enjoy working with my co-workers they are all friendly and easy to work with. I would have to say the most enjoyable part about working at Party City would be making a customer who has had a bad day come in and smile because we have the product they have been looking for."
good,typical day at party city is friendly enviroment with great costumers and great co workers. the management was great they were very friendly and helpful and they also gave me the tools to better myself such as giving the challeges of figuring out how things worked around there without being told how to do them. my co workers were fantastic. the staff was great and always made me feel like i was part of the team and family it was a great job not only for the experience but also for the family within the company. i would ahve to say that was the best part of the job. honestly the hardest part of the job was taking a day off that was how comfortable to be there.

good,The job required to help customers and sale Halloween costumes. I learned how to approach people. I didn't like going outside and spinning the sign. I cant get a permanent position there because my brother is a manager there. It was a great experience!!

Immediately, my co-workers and I begin to work, always keeping an eye out for out of place merchandise but still maintaining an approachable demeanor and willingness to approach customers in need."

good,"I really enjoyed my experience working with Party City. It is exactly what the name implies. There are supplies & favors for everything. The staff is amazing to work with and you feel good being within its doors. Diversity is not a problem and if you have a flair for ""modeling"" the merchandise, it's smiled on instead of feeling silly or childish. It really is a pleasant place to work and still feel like an individual."

I enjoyed wearing a costume to greet and help customers find what costumes they might like to purchase as well as gaining a little working experience to edit my resume.

good,"A typical work day was either busy and fast-paced or calm and collected depending on the season. While on the job I learned a great deal of communication skills and teamwork among coworkers, everyone complied and got along well. Management was well formed and met all expectations. Workplace culture was greatly respected and handled delicately with caution. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the poor behaviors of unsatisfied costumers. The most enjoyable part of the job of the job was helping costumers with their requests and questions, by helping those who need it made my time there pleasant."
good,"This job teaches you the important foundations of team work, and patience. I highly recommend this fun environment to anyone just starting out or in need of a second part time job. "

good,some workers are friendly and some can be rude and distant. management is very uptight and are hard on their workers. but overall a good way to learn customer service.
good,"All of the staff at Halloween City knew what they were doing and always on top of everything making sure everything is done. Management cares about there employee's, we had alot of homeless people around are dumbsters and on top of the building at night. So we were not allowed to take the trash out alone or after 7."

good,"I enjoyed helping out in the Halloween season, learning new stocking strategies and sharing my existing stocking experience with others."
good,"A typical day at work would include watching the dressing rooms, pick up items that fell on the floor and put them in their right spot, look in the back for other costumes for customers, take phone calls and answer the customers questions, and do cash register. I learned how to work retail and interact with customers more. The hardest part of the job would be if several customers needed assistance and you had to help all of them at once. Another hard part would be to make sure nothing gets stolen. I really liked this job because to me i love working retail. I like face paced jobs that make me multitask in order to get everything done."
good,"In this high paced environment, customer satisfaction is a priority. Corrective action in customer recovery and retention, in the event that a customer is unsatisfied, is the highest of priorities."
good,"Pro: GREAT especially during the holidays, great people. There's never a dull!! Easy jobs like answering phones, filling orders, interacting with customers"
good,"As a Halloween City customer service associate I assisted customers making purchases, finding special orders, and selecting appropriate accessories.

good,This summer internship was filled with a variety of different projects that were very interesting. We had a group project that we worked half the week on and an individual project for the rest of the week. We were assigned a department supervisor who mentored us throughout the summer. Everyone was very accommodating and willing to help and answer questions. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a business related internship.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working at party city! The pay and hours could have been better but I had awesome coworkers and a fun environment to work in. Not to mention all the cool party stuff. It never gets boring.

good,"Extremely fun workplace! I loved the people and I picked up a lot of skills working here. I earned a lot and everyday never felt like work, it felt like doing something I enjoyed."
good,I love decorating and helping people make the party as fun and coordinated as possible. Helping down from invitations to what kind of plates and silverware and sometimes we would get baby reveals those are exciting. The pay was just not so great only reason I left unfortunately.
good,while working at party city its was very busy. i really don't have any problems with this place everybody works together and stays on top of everything and doesn't mind helping anyone in need of help. i had to quit because of lack of transportation.
good,It was temporary but the management was great! Always kept a very positive environment. Made sure you knew your work was appreciated. Overall a great experience.
good,"A typical day at work was pretty awesome for my first city job. I learned all the experiences I will need to have in the future, management was nice the environment was peaceful etc. The hardest part of the job was honestly, not that hard at all. Going back and forth through my assigned areas, making everything was tidy, was a breeze but, once you have finished that I would have to keep pretending like it is not so my manager would not fire me. The most enjoyable part of the job would be, seeing all the new faces of customers coming in asking me for help, and leaving satisfied will their help provided from me."
good,"I started here with no work experience. I worked during Halloween. It was fast paced but not overly difficult. I was in the back pulling costumes, which is great for someone who prefers to be more behind the scenes. All you have to do is listen to your in-ears for the people at the picture wall to read you the costume info, find it and set it out for the customer to pick up. The costume boxes are sorted so you get the hang of it pretty quickly. You take one customer's costume order at a time, so don't think they will be piling up while you're frantically trying to remember numbers and sizes. It is tiring during busy stretches but there will be an occasional lull where you are supposed to assist in cleaning up the store, sometimes during which customers will ask you questions. If you don't know the answer you can always ask for help in your walky talky. But generally customer interaction is pretty minimal. After you have this job (especially if it is your first job) you will probably be decent at anything else in retail."
good,I loved working at party city. My co workers were amazing and my store manager was a real sweet heart they were over all just great people. the job its self was easy it did get hectic when busy. But overall a great job id work there again!
good,"A typical work day included ringing up customers, filling up balloons, restocking shelves, and helping customers find what they were looking for.

good,"A typical day at work would be on and off. Some days it would be busy and other days it won't be busy.

The management staff I worked with were very fun and enjoyable strange people to work with. They knew how to have fun at work but also knew how to get their work done in a manor that made in enjoyable to do."

good,"As a Halloween temp, I most often worked the costume wall and in the back room, with radios. This taught me how to use a short range radio and the importance of communication between coworkers. As for management, my supervisors were very friendly and polite, not to mention fun to work with. My coworkers were the same for the most part, there was only one person I did not get along with and that person did not stay very long. The hardest part of the job was also the most enjoyable - the customers. Some were demanding and rude, but that just made it so much more rewarding when I saw the gratitude on their face when I helped them find what they were looking for."
good,This is a great store to work at the have a great environment they great workers i love the people that i am working with. when they come back next year i would love to work for them again. they are not like other Halloween stores they are family friendly.

good,My typical day at work was when the employee was schedule to come to work and he/she had no call no show. It would really mess up the schedule and especially 2 days before Halloween. This is when we are the busiest. We have lot's of fun when things are going well.
good,"a typical day at work for me was showing customers to what they needed i also put things back where they were suppose to go and various things in the back room "
good,"This was my first actual real job, and i loved the experience, i only wish that it could have been longer. I was introduced to new things, new jobs new people, new attitudes and i am thankful for that experience. There were quite a few people who the job didn't work out for and for me it just stuck for me. It was an amazing experience and i hope to do it again!"
good,"I loved the upper management staff and the employees that I was in charge of. It was such a fun place to work, everyone got along, and despite being a regular employee as well at one time, once I got promoted none of the employees had issues with that and treated me with respect. Its a very fast paced environment there is also something to do and running back and fourth to and from the back and front of the store. Job duties including a lot of heavy lifting, and patient interaction as it was a retail store, returns and questions were an everyday occurrence"
good,A typical day would be coming in and getting into our store gear. I would greet customers and assist with any help as well as try and sell items that seemed to fit them. The hardest part of the job would just be busy hectic hours and concentration was a must.
good,Work as cashier so deal with many different kind of people. A lot of people like to party and celebrate with family! Dealing with rude not helpful people. Working the register
good,"Depending on the day, it was always different. It was a consistent thing. You just knew what the day was going to be like depending on the day of the week. Daily tasks, those were the same. Clock in, throw freight, help customers, cashier duties, and cleaning. What I learned... I was bumped up to freight manager pretty quickly. This was a new thing for me; I learned the basic logistics of shipping, but most of that was still left to our receiver, and also product placement. Also, during certain times of the year, it was a very high pressure customer experience, which is something I preferred. I enjoy customers. A lot. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with my duties, but once I found a routine that worked for me, I was golden. The best part of the job was the fast pace. I love being busy, running around doing tasks, helping customers, what have you, It was great!"

I answer phone calls and fulfill their questions about an item, inflate balloons, do go-backs, recovery, down stock, and help customers find an item. Management is well-organized. My co-workers were great people to work with, not only that, but it was a diverse working place.

So many personalities and all of them blended together so well. It was definitely fun working there. I got my first experience at running a retail store on my own.

Management was great, they do their best to help you. The workplace environment was great, everyone enjoys helping each other out.

good,"Party City was one of the most fun and enjoyable places to work at. Although it is very fast paced, everyday is a different task so it doesn't get repetitive. The staff were very friendly and fun overall. The only negatives of this job are the short hours (usually always 4 or 5 hour shifts), and the customers complaining about things that you can't do anything about. This job also required a lot of attention to detail as the customers will do anything to not pay for what they have bought (because its too expensive). You really have to know what you are doing. Other than that, great job."

good,"i learned so much about this company how to do correct mistakes i've made, the management and the coworkers were so nice to me would work there again if had the chance"
good,"My typical day at Party City was busy due to store administrators constantly providing with various tasks to complete, such as move/fix products in the aisles, aid customers, and register new merchandise. I have received a valuable experience in providing exceptional customer service and in doing various merchandising work. The most difficult part of the job was the physical work I was assigned to, such as moving boxes of merchandise from one place to another. On the other hand, the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing happy customers finding what they are looking for with my aid."
good,"I often opened the store more than I closed it, which meant turning on all the lights, balancing and opening cash registers, checking all animatronics and inflating all inflatables and setting up all stations for the day. Upper management was very understand and flexible when need be and in return, I was the first to volunteer for extra hours that needed picked up or busy days where other were needed to come in early. I loved being able to help costumers either find their costume or put it together, and even did costume make-up for tips Halloween night after a certain employee promised multiple people of such and then quit and began threatening the store and everyone in it. This employee incident also lead to plenty of police contact that myself and main management handled often to keep our store and employee's safe. Crowds got CRAZY the closer it got to the holiday and there was often entire days in a row where I was literally running back and forth across the store non-stop making sure to help and and every customer. It was a lot of hard work but the best working experience I have ever had <3"

I learned to work with customers in a fast and timely manor enjoyed management, they where always polite to me. My co workers were very helpful right after I got done training. Any questions I had, they would answer. The hardest part of my job was getting 10-20 people costumes without anyone getting upset. The most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere. Its a very decorated store, you get different kinds of costumers all the time, and helping someone find exactly what they needed."
good,"A typical day of work at Party City, was keeping busy.  It was a energetic and positive atmosphere to work in.  I bonded with a couple co- workers who actually took the time to get to know me.  Sometimes the management was unprofressional and instead of being a boss more of a dictator.  The hardest part of the job was trying to make relationships with people who werent interested.  The most enjoyable part, was learning new things and getting to meet new people.  I enjoy when customers walked out satisfied and enjoying their time shopping with us!  There was more good then bad and now I am ready to learn more!!!"
good,Loved working there you have to be willing to get the job done and finish what you start the right way.
good,A day at party city to me was a blessing everyday.  i was surrounded by great people who gave me a chance and reacted to me as if we known each other since forever. Being there i learned that if you work hard together as a team you can conquer any problem that comes your way. My managers Carissa & Johnathan are very nice people and taught me a lot. The hardest part about the job was dealing with rude customers who seemed like they did want to be bothered but actually needed help.but i learned that sometimes you have to have thick skin (be tough) and wait until the wanted to stop being stubborn. I can say the part that i loved about that job is meeting new people and learning who they are and getting on a first name basis.People matter.
good,"I loved this job. I got to wear costumes to work, worked with my friends, met great people that loved Halloween. As a teenager this job was amazing"
good,During a regular day there are many customers and a constantly changing work environment. This can be very fun if you can keep up with a fast paced job and can finish tasks quickly yet still successfully.
good,"At Party City I was only hired as a seasonal employee and a typical day there consisted of a lot of big over seas sales. I learned how to handle big portions of cash at once, along with petty cash handling a cash register and merchandise. My management there was phi-nominal as well as my co-workers. The hardest part of my job there was the large transactions making sure that everything was rang up and rang up correctly. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers pick out the right costumes and party favors accordingly to what they were looking for."
good,"I worked a typical 8:30 to 5:00 shift Monday thru Friday. I would go in, do what work I had to do for my position, then I would help out with everything else. I learned pretty much everything there was to learn about Party City during the time I worked there. Which I liked because it gave me the ability to help out in multiple areas of the store. The co-workers were always fun to work with, it was like a small family. There wasn't anything that was hard about the job, just sometimes stressfull during the busy seasons. The job in full was enjoyable."
good,"The atmosphere is great and employees, for the most part, are personable yet professional. Although it can be demanding at times, especially in a managerial position, I found the work to be rewarding, fun and seldom boring."
good,"Well, you see Party City was a bit of a proper introduction on how it feels to have perspective on how a employee feels. Having to clean the aisles, restock according to barcode, dealing with persistent guests. Real eye opener if you ask me. Yet, its always a pleasure of coarse. Not only because if you truly say how one feels youll get fired or laid off, i did it because im naturally a good hearted person. Just need to place yourself in ones shoes and lead by example."
good,Party City always makes sure that the customer and the employee are being treated right and will do whatever it takes to make sure everyone is happy!!

What was the most difficult time was when things became rushed I was there for their version of black Friday which is the Saturday before Halloween and the day before in which it was so many people there that it was tough to keep up with orders but it also helped with hat sense of make sure it's done right otherwise now we are wasting time and effort. What was nice was that we were always trying to support the idea of hey it's a party and this is what we do even allowing us to dress up with some of the characters in the store.

It can become very fast paced, however, as Halloween approaches. More customers are coming in making a mess of the store. Nonetheless, this makes the job go by very quickly if you continuously pick up after messy customers. You don't even notice your shift is over until your replacement comes in or the doors are locked.

I learned tons about costumer service skills and how to work inventory systems as well as the cash registers. The management there was so great and so willing to work around busy schedules and they understood that sometimes life gets in the way. The hardest part of the job was probably during Halloween when you're just in awe by how many people wait until the last minute to buy costumes and supplies. The easiest park was probably baloon counter.
