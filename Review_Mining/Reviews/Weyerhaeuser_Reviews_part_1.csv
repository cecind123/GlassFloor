bad,No words no advance for blacks discrimination racist low down I wouldn't want no one to work there.......if it was the last job on earth I would not work
bad,"Wevco is in this mode of hiring and promoting  young engineers that have no experience and have read everything they no from a book. Trying to tell the experienced how things work. "
bad,"Many positions required to work in multiple locations without any assistance. doing one job and being called to perform task in other plant locations. While trying to complete the first task, personnel will be hollering at you to complete another task."
bad,I learned that management is awful. they don't work with you for any reasons and I mean any reasons. I would not ever work there again for no amount of money.
bad,The job is very stressful and they only care about production they do not care about the safety of the employees. The management is very poor and they are careless. The work place culture is like being in a prison. The best part of the day is leaving
bad,"Union combined with bad Management will ultimately cause the mill to close down."
bad,extremely fast paced. Under paid no appreciation for drivers. always stressed about HOS deliveries are maxed racing the clock. Working for free on their time taking mandatory company classes that should be getting paid for.
bad,"Good company, just not in Louisville anymore. Moved distribution center to the mid-west to better facilitate distribution of building materials.  This is still a thriving company with great products."
bad,"Let's start with that I have been with Weyerhaeuser for four years and have only received one raise, with over 95% ratings on my annual reviews. I had plenty of meetings explaining my intent on moving up with the company over the last few years. Yes, I took on many roles outside the scoop of my original job duties. Such as Safety, Training and Inventory Managment to name a few. I have in all of these cases excelled and either came up with new SOP's or saved our site hundreds of thousands in potential fines. Yep, our site was operating with no forklift certifications for two years...that's two years. "
bad,"If you like being yelled at by the plant manager everyday and feel bad about doing your job, this is the place for you. It is an awful dirty place to work and the head guy does his best to use threats to make you work. Good Luck."
bad,the worst place ever to work preach safety but in reality they do not care mgmt is uneducated liars best advise is stay away from new bern lumber saw mill in vanceboro nc
bad,They expect you to do your best with poor equipment. Every year they take away from our benefit package.
bad,"Very negative workers, manager stole money out of an employee purse and lied to the employee saying she had the police on the way so she could file a report but the police never arrived. Very rude to customers, no respect"
bad,Enjoyed going in everyday to do my job.Set-up machine. Ran a few boards.Did quality check.Let co-worker out for breaks.Continue checking quality the rest of shift. Most co-workers where understanding people.Hardest part of job was dealing with a co-worker who extremely bad. I received many treats for 3yrs. Continue to tell management about this problems. Nothing ever was done about it. Even got to the point where I was hit and nothing was never about it. Sad but true. Spent 25yrs. With company and I never thought management could be so bad.Just this type of behavior go on for long.It wasnt always like it my first 21yrs. New mangers came in and hired certain people they wanted.Even though they was not qualified.Could write a book about it but I will stop here.If anybody wants to no more papers to prove it.
bad,"The management doesn't know it's left arm from its right arm.  You can be fired for being hurt here.  Be prepared for bullying by management.  The head guy is a kid who hires his buddies.  Problems abound in this older, dirty mill.  Clean up just sits there.  Long hours and the overtime goes to taxes, so, not worth it.  Unless you are a total loner with no family and no friends, then this is place for you.  You will sign your life away to work long dirty days by yourself.  It takes someone to get  hurt before they put the proper signage up.  Then they act like its your fault you got hurt.  Cleaner uses Windex to clean everything.  They don't disinfect, so cold season is a nightmare here.  Weyerhaueser scabs out labor to contractors.  These lower paid scabs get no benefits and are always on call, they have been using scab labor for seven years straight now to save on costs and not pay benefits.  These scabs are well loved and will take a Weyerhaueser employees' job.  Typical non union American company that doesn't care about it's Canadian workers, only that it can get logging contracts for the cheap Canadian stumpage fees.  All American logging has to be paid for as its on private property.  Here in Canada, they just take advantage of the Crown Land.  Very corporate culture.  Just rude."
bad,Terrible company to work for managent doesnt care about you or your safety as long as youre doing 200% efficiency then they will tell you to go faster
bad,"If you don't fit in with the crew your wasting your time. If your not part of the ""click"" then you will be made to feel like you are trash and unwanted. Management is a joke as well. Safety is a joke. I wouldn't recommend working at this circus to my worst enemy."
bad,"New hires will not be offered a pension fund as of January 2020, and the decent health, dental and vision insurance will be replaced with an HSA with a terribly high deductible. The pay is extremely outdated, this is by no means a family supporting job. Salary / management is sneaky, will gaslight you and won’t hesitate backstabbing if it meant a shoe up for them. You will start on nights working split days off and most likely sundays for several years before you see a change up. Crew morality has been dead and gone for years with no sign of resurrection. Machines have polices set in place that result in you operating them with as little personal dedication making as possible, with consequences for deviating from them. The latest contract between the company and union has loopholes in place that more or less allow the company to change work policies when they desire. You will have high expectations on you at all times with no motivation, recognition or morality. You will be a nothing more than a number here."
bad,"I have been there for 3 years. The schedule is awful; 2 weeks of dayshift, then 2 weeks of nightshift; 12 hour shifts. In the summer time the temperatures in my work area reach 105 degrees and 100% humidity on a regular basis. The work is monotonous. We get laid off all of the time due to poor sells and low log inventory. Management is clueless. The only good thing is the pay."
bad,"Co-workers were terrible. Not helpful, selfish and mean. They were not willing to help new hires and I was even bullied constantly by one co-worker. I would never recomemend anyone to work here"
bad,"Weyerhaeuser has struggled operating this mill as well other mills in the south.  Stock price has hovered at $30 for many years under Weyerhaeuser's leadership.  The corporate office is too far disconnected from the mills and tend to expect unrealistic results.  The mill is old with much of the equipment heavily worn and in disrepair.  The pay for both hourly and salary are not competitive for the area.   The company intends to stay competitive on salaries in the ""industry"" instead of being competitive with local industry.  Salary positions are usually very long hours with no compensation for working late, or working weekends and holidays.  .  No much security in salary positions with current upper management.  The hourly ranks are cover under the local union.   The local union representatives are concerned for their other union ""pals"" instead of representing the entire workforce. If you like long hours for uncompetitive pay, this maybe a good place for you."
bad,Benefits ok.  Pay ok. Can work all you want but no advancement. No team work. Plant in poor condition. Management won't work with employees but blame employees for everything that goes wrong with equipment.
bad,"Headquarter region has been dinged by EEOC for discrimination of minorities. They overlooked them for advancement and promotions. Women are not treated as well as men. They like to push their political agendas on their employees. Overall, the worst experience ever!!!"
bad,Management is lacking and untrustworthy. You can be fired for many small technicalities. And they will look for them when they no longer want your services.
bad,"Pay and benefits were great, but work atmosphere was terrible. If you need a job in a pinch this is a great stepping stone. A word of advice: If you get the job continue to apply to other places if you value you life, happiness, and sanity."
bad,"they treat you like an idiot. safe hard work means very little, and only butt kissing gets you anywhere. the only way to stand the place for any length of time is to stop caring."
bad,"wouldn't recommend a job here. the work environment is fast paced, training the employees needs to be better. it's extremely hot in the summer and cold in the winter."
bad,"Poor culture. Tail wags the dog. Silence is Golden Rule. See nothing, say nothing.  Accepted rampant bullying of many employees by other employees.  Asbestos was in machine insulation."
bad,"If your looking for back stabbing than come here it's the best. They are always looking for a new scape goat."
bad,"Management is the worst, would never recommend this job to anyone. If you’re working at 110% they expect 220% out of you. Management never listens they’ll rather make your life miserable until you quit or you’re fired."
bad,"The new production manager enjoys bullying his subordinates. He is vindictive and holds grudges anytime you question or call him out on something he is doing that isnt proper. I was served a disciplinary letter for making a worksafe claim, a claim and return to work program that management, HR, and the adjuster all agreed to. When I came back fit for work i was told if I took another sick day I would be fired. There is no advancement here. They show favoritism for the people who.act buddy buddy with the manager or shift workers, even if they aren't good at their job. I was told by supervisors and shift workers that I was doing a very good job and excelling and showing promise, but after a review of my performance with the production manager, I was told i was not a team player and not working hard enough. Despite that year working more overtime then I could ever imagine. "
bad,"They say they like diversity but hire Mexicans as janitors, people from India for IT work and it took me at least 2 yrs to see one African Anerican working there. It was quite sterotypical to say the least."
bad,"Poor management is just the tip of the iceberg.  This place is easily the worst place I’ve ever worked, and I’ve had some bad jobs.  Rampant favoritism by managers, working schedules are terrible, you are either hardly working or working way too much, training is laughable, I could go on all day, constant threats by management about keeping your job and they have files on everybody like they are trying to find a way to fire you, mainly my advice is to stay far away."
bad,I have been with the company for over a decade and there is no people development and very few opportunities in different departments. The company as a whole is not cohesive and leaves a lot to be desired.
bad,"* A typical day at work generally had to do with fixing things that randomly broke as opposed to a planned system of maintenance to proactively prevent things from breaking."
bad,"If you like lazy people , they see you as a number , work hard they pay no attention ,youll never move up , theyll give a job to someone with no sense and no experience vs someone who has 20 years of experience if the boss likes them"
bad,I was injured very shortly into my employment. Ordered on light duty then let go 2 weeks after Dr.s release. Started off on the wrong foot sort on speak.
bad,"this company has done nothing but gone down hill every year for the last 7 years at least. every time we think it can't get worse, it does. we have worked less than 40 hrs a wk for more than half the year for the last 4-5 years. the cost of labor adjustment that we are supposed to get yearly we have only received twice in the past 7 years. management has ran this plant in the ground. it used to be a great place to work with competitive pay and benefits. now you don't work enough hours to be able to pay your bills.  when we are working our regular hours we have to save all that money to go with our tax return to make it through the slow times.  management only cares about corporate and their bonus. they do not pass the profits on to their employees.  they profited 40 million last year at this facility and the biggest cost of labor adjustment was like 30 cents. some of the managers go back and take time off your time card because they don't want you to have that many hours, even though they told you that you could get forty hours. seniority means absolutely nothing out here. supervisors that have been here for over 20 years get fired over personal differences, things that have nothing to do with work. very little chance for advancement."
bad,Don't run out of time taking care of your family. They won't help you at all. The main boss doesn't keep up with any employee issues or family situations.
bad,"I worked in a paper mill that no longer exists.  The employees went on strike asking for higher pay.  The company responded by demolishing the entire operation.  This mill had set world record production but the company didn't care.  To add to this, my father was part of the 70% of employees that were laid off all at once in the whole company.  They no longer make paper.  They are a REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) because that gets them better tax cuts."
bad,"I loved my time at Weyerhaeuser. Everyone treated me fairly, and they were extremely flexible with my schedule since I was still going to school."
bad,"Weyerhaeuser has been a great place to work until about 2008. The people are great. Flexible work situations. Since 2008, they have been regularly laying people off and now are starting to cut salaries in the corporate headquarters."
bad,"Hard to learn your job when no one in your group speaks English. Green houses we're ridiculously hot, heat strokes were expected. You work at your own pace."
bad,"Your job advancement is based on your ability to read and take tests on equipment that is not in the mill. In the past five years only one millright has gotten a raise. "
bad,Don't do it. Bad supervisors and horrible schedules. Advancement is based on favorites not hardwork. Underappreciated workers and rude environment. Regret is all that it gives you.
bad,"Most of the hourly employees were really good to supervise. The Production Manager that was there at the time was difficult to work for and with. The was very load, aggressive and did not respect anyone. Also, he like to micro manage which doesn't give you time to do your job correctly."
bad,Weyerhaeuser is a great company to work for. The benefits are exceptional and the pay is competitive. there is always something to learn!
bad,"a hole bunch of wood comes out and hits the table. as it spins in a circle, with not much help at all. a normal day is wood falling every couple of seconds. the management don't really lead much they just walk around and give orders. the culture is lacking moral and care. the hardest part is coming to a job where you don't feel wanted or cared about. the best part is driving forklifts."
bad,"Don't make any long term financial commitments when working for this company and save every dime you can is the best advice I can give you if you choose to work for this company because it will likely be shut down with out any notice to you."
bad,"Good coworkers overall, some good supervisors, others not so good. Had a good safety program, however that has changed. Possibly has improved since I left."
bad,"Loud and Filty environment, Union official all unethical as well as management. Everyone concerned with self. No opportunity to advance corporate more concerned with share holders than employees"
bad,Enjoyed going to work every day. Loved my job and people I worked with. Great teamwork environment. Pay was excellent. Benefits were great.
bad,"Swing shifts "
bad,I thought my employers would be there for me but they were not. I wish I never worked for them. Biggest regret of my life.............................
bad,Weyerhaeuser is overall a 5/10 place to work. seems to be a disconnect between management/production/maintenance with not everyone on the same page at the same time.
bad,Experienced such harrasement not only emotionally but thru mgt...many mgrs were fired...and us women were left to pay the consequences of that last effort on their part. (We have all since left) - the enviroment was Toxic.
bad,New CEO wants to cut operating costs (E.g.terminate people)   Company downsizing.  Closed Boise and now planning on sending logistics support from Fed Wy to Hot Springs AR.  Not a good time to work here.
bad,i was let go after 15 years in favor of someone that held the same position.  I was a product of the takeover and lost my long time position due to it.
bad,Most of the employees are great. The management is unprofessional at best. There is little to no communication between shifts and supervisors actively work against each other between departments for what seems like ego boosting. They are unwilling to listen to others ideas to improve processes or policies.
bad,We worked mandatory overtime 41 of the 52 weeks last year.  We got 11 Saturdays off to spend with our families and/or friends. I have seen our work schedule ruin multiple marriages and relationships because we don't get to spend time with our significant others.
bad,"Decent benefits, but I was never sure of the overall corporation strategy and what the future state being desired by the CEO and/or board of directors was."
bad,"Non loyal, have to know people to better yourself. Not about what you kno but who you know. Sometimes it can be an ok place to work"
bad,"HARD HOT & COLD Work."
bad,"There has been a downturn of employee moral in the more than a decade I have been here. Management is determined to belittle and dishearten anyone and everyone. No one works together and because of the questionable rules established it is us against them."
bad,"Work life balance is not balanced at all."
bad,Great place to polish and develop unorthodox leadership styles when dealing with union bargaining. The hardest part of the job was to define management goals.  Management did not support out-of-the-box decisions to meet production.
bad,Your typical union shop.  Manufacturing boxes is exactly what it sounds like.  Very repetitive and having to work with poorly maintained equipment was not fun
bad,"not that bad to work at ,good pay,dencent breaks,nice co-workers,the management not so good it's all about the numbers they don't really care about your personal life."
bad,"I have come to find myself wondering how it is that this company has managed to stay running for as long as it has. Management seems to lack any and every quality required to manage and otherwise lead others. I could go on, but I'm sure you get the idea."
bad,"They set unrealistic goals, threaten to fire or write you up when you don't complete the 20 different task they assign you.They preach team work but always assign you to do a task alone when the task requires 2-3 people.They have outsourced their hiring to a temp agency, so it's a constant process of firing for the smallest mistake, hiring, and training of new people.Which takes a toll on the full time employees and it creates problems in safety ,quality of products and quantity of products."
bad,"Come in, attend preshift. fill out all documentation before loading tools up. respond to all the Mechanical breakdown call out threw out entire plant (by myself). sign parts out. complete w.o. report everything. follow all safety procedures ."
bad,"No matter what's the  situation from clean up  to someone not showing up, jr. employees always always catch the bitter end, while other employees with 5yrs plus, never clean up and their opinions are the only ones that are considered."
bad,"I was a contractor there on a 6 month guaranteed mininum assignment. About 3 months after I was hired, I was told my contract would not be renewed and it was my last day on assignment. That was the day before Thanksgiving. I had to cancel my holidayplans and my manager never did bother to reply to an email I sent requesting info and feedback. I learned a few weeks later they released me because they hired too many people for the assignment."
bad,"Bad planning, no strategy on people development. HR is only a payroll department and works to protect company."
bad,"I have enjoyed my time with Weyerhaeuser.  I love the people I work with and the job itself, but Management at this time is very unreasonable.  Goals and Expectations are unreasonable and impossible to achieve.  Very high stress with an undertone of doom.  Employee moral is way down from previous years."
bad,"basic labor, I learned a lot about safety, I had good managers, and some that were not so pleasing, good co- workers, puling lumber from assembly line, enjoying my co-workers and when we worked as a team"
bad,"Excellent benefits, telecommute opportunities. Management inconsistent."
bad,The management makes last minute calls to add days onto the work week and never being able to provide a reliable schedule for families to make plans. Often times any schedule that is provided will be altered up to 24 hours in advance to run up to 6 11 hour shifts a week.
bad,"Upper management is overpaid, and justify existence by the amount of meetings attended, and oh boy are there a LOT of redundant meetings, so I guess that mean they're being productive...LOL. Huge disconnect, and often no clue what their subordinates job duties and skills actually are. Much worse after merger with Plum Creek."
bad,Loaded pulp products onto trailers/containers for delivery to customers.
bad,"drove a forklift most days"
bad,this job sucks. got paid pennies to risk my life with dangerous machinery daily. you dont have to do dangerous tasks but you wont last too long if you dont. long swing shifts and they will keep you temp forever
bad,"Great culture of integrity, diversity and respect for others. Absolutely amazing safety focus and this company means it. Increasingly focused on high performance and winning at everything it does."
bad,I do not care for factory work because it is tedious. Each day is the same thing day in and day out.
bad,"My recommendation is to not apply for the merchandising coordinator position listed at this company. To avoid a long and probably too detailed story, the management needs dire improvement. I can gurantee that you will most likely not be happy in this position for long since nothing you do will ever be good enough.Trust me. Also, it is a temp to hire position which means you may find yourself out of a job within a few months and left with zero explanation as to why. Again, trust me!"
bad,Management changed and my new manager was very difficult and harassed me on a daily basis.  Especially throughout my entire pregnancy.  HR did not go to bat for me even with my proof of email and the witness from other co-workers.
good,You go to work every day wondering who is going to try to fire you. You are expected to do 60 hours of work in 20. Everything is falling apart and the parts you do actually get are wrong 70% of the time. Any REAL Millwright with self esteem and pride in his work should avoid this place.
good,"12 hr days/nights, inconsistent following of policy, very hot, they hire obvious idiots and keep them around. Management lies, overworked, if you're on night shift it's very hard to speak to a higher manager because they are never there."
good,"Made interviewers aware of the situation prior to hire, domestic abuse and court. Assured me they would work with me. Ultimately did not. Was fired for a family emergency (kid wreck) and the stress made me pass out. Was then fired for “missing days.” Supervisors are not in sync, what one tells you to do, another writes you up for. What one line tender says don’t do, another says to do it."
good,"managment bullied hourly employees"
good,My particular job was quite painful. Extremely arduous and fatiguing I do not recommend anyone to work here as a laborer. This employer does not treat its blue collar workers as humans.
good,Busy during lunch not a dull moment dealing with the weyerhaeuser employees.team work was great and the catering were even more fun.
good,Typical day was providing accurate and timely orders filled with treated lumber and building material products to all the Home Depot stores in Michigan and Northern Ohio.  The hardest part of the job was learning all the material provided to the different lumber yards across Michigan.  Co-workers and Management had a good working relationship and good communication between each other.
good,"I would recommend this job to someone who is local and just beginning a career. Great starter job. No pay raises, everybody's paid the same with no room for growth"
good,"It was a decent place to work, but after 13 years, I finally figured out that there was nothing there that I wanted to do for the rest of my life."
good,"they push product over safety, if you do not rush production they will yell at you, and this cause a lot of injuries, which if you were injured while at work, you were fired."
good,Daily work was hard and long. Typically 12 hours per day. People were not placed in the correct positions.Too much uncertainty with daily tasks.  Management was poor and unprofessional.
good,Good job security but life balance is not well. Work too many days of the week and management needs to work on their people skills also favoritism! You do not realize how bad it is until you leave!
good,long and boring is a typical day at work . I became a better learner . my co-workers were pretty nice people to work with . Going home was the most enjoyable part of the job
good,I worked 10 hours nightshift. It was difficult with small children. I was the only woman on shift and was reminded of it on several occasions.
good,Loaded trls all night.
good,"The only thing upper management cares about is production. After working 27 consecutive days I was told by the mill manager that there are more important things than time off, as he returned from his normal weekend off to spend with his family. There is NO work/life balance. If you are in a supervisory role, you are expected to be on call 24/7, cancel planned vacations, pretty much devote every minute of your life to the mill."
good,"Weyerhaeuser is an amazing company. They have great benefits and a strong safety culture. "
good,A good place to work but very long hours. Management sometimes don't seem to be concerned about employees morale. Company offers good benefits and overall can earn a good living
good,No career advancement within my current position. Too far away from home for salary earned. Too little work ethics among associates I work with. Seems most don’t even want a job.
good,typical day at work is very mundane. when driving the forklift  your on you own to supply  production with the proper grades and amount of veneer and keep management apprised of inventory and problems with wet/ bad veneer. must also be very flexible and able to flow to work as needed.
good,I would not recommend anyone working for weyhaeuser if you can work somewhere else. Hot work and long hours. You get written up for the smallest thing. You also get treated liked a child from this company. Management knows nothing of the job that you do.
good,While I learned a lot as a millwright and met some really great people. The management sucks. they play favoritism and are out of touch with the people who actually make the place run .
good,Must be able to fit into a very formal culture.  New CEO is an alien from a different planet who only cares about the short term increase in value of his stock options.
good,Learned a lot.  They will help you get the education to be successful in the position your in.  Even though you perform your job safely and meet the goals that are set for you.  That doesn't matter if they are having cut backs.
good,"Company has great benefits offers to its employees. If everything runs as planned, your work  day normally runs smoothly. The hardest part of my job can sometimes be cleanup."
good,This company was good to work for in the sense they took care of their people.  The reason I left was a very long commute. I had two small children at home
good,"Long hours, no appreciation for job well done. Company does not care much about its employees. Supervisor created a poor working relationship with her immediate reports."
good,"A typical day work  include meeting with team members to go over job plan and schedule work for the day to learned about the different aspects of safety and how to handle any situation that may occur during the shift , I learned some thing new most every day because of the equipment from bearing to shaft to mobile equipment, crane and the list goes on .Management is some what  good ,but can used some improvement and have excellent co-workers ,the hardest part of my job is climbing into tight places and keeping clean and the most enjoyable part of the job what I do and learn from day to day."
good,New plant manager changed the culture in a negative way. Micro managed to the extreme with people making decisions who do not know the ins and outside or how to operate the processes or machines they are making decisions on. Left after 13+ years. Do not regret it.
good,"It was a good company to work as far as benefits go for, the management team was very poor a lot of stress and a lot of hours not a lot of room for advancement."
good,"Some of the coworkers are very nice, others are troublemakers who like to stir the pot for no reason.  Management wants to hire younger generation for less money."
good,"A fun to place to work at times, but not so much most of the time due to the manager assigned to the group that I was assigned to. There was a lot of micro management occurring with the manager of the group which caused a lot of in fighting and controversy within the team. There was a good bit of bias and rumor mill mixed in as well. However, I learned a lot and I was able to use this bad experience as a stepping stone to move on to even greater opportunities."
good,Worked with great team members that help each other out.  Lots of people you can go to for help.  Open door policy made it easy to discuss and learn.  Knowledgeable team members.  Lots of built in processes that help with efficiency.
good,"When I started at Weyerhauser the company appeared to have a long-term focus on the future, and developed businesses and technologies to ensure diversity during times when wood prices were low. Since then the culture shifted to short-term resource extraction, from the land it holds and from its employees. The company sold many of the diversified businesses to focus on wood products. I'm concerned about their sustainability when the price of wood drops. "
good,"job itself is retirement level and fairly easy, however the management doesn't have any respect for the staff whatsoever and disregards all  the staff experience and basically tells us we just don't understand how the process works. Unfortunately  with zero time in this plant and has yet to ask anyone here how the system works.Will not take advice from anyone but wants to make changes without understanding the process."
good,I worked for Weyerhaeuser when it was still a full forest products company. They have divested of all of their manufacturing and cannot speak of the culture of today as a real estate company.
good,"The H&IP division was a very small business group in the very large organizational whole.  As a result and as the economy weakened, less capital was expended for the business to be competitive and take advantage of market opportunities and potential for growth was lost."
good,"Claims safety is key but is more concerned with production then safety. Not very friendly environment, ask the wrong persona question and they will make your life miserable."
good,"The employees are great people. You may have some work life balance, when everything is working in g ood order. Management  is not good at understanding weekends off.  worked for over a year and half with one raise. Others that report to supervision and management often get raises on time. The job is not bad it's the people that are in competition for control."
good,"Slow to make decisions, have meeting after meeting but never solve or directly address the issues at hand. Weyco is too big to fail otherwise the already would have"
good,"Before considering working at Weyerhaeuser, consider that they are a REIT but act like a Corporation. They are shedding weight at a fast pace. There are rumors that the company headquarters is moving. Keep that in mind."
good,"After being at Weyerhaeuser for many years and through the administration of three CEOs, it has become apparent that with each successive CEO, the Senior Management Team has gone further and further away from those qualities and values that made Weyerhaeuser great.  Communication is becoming scarcer and scarcer, change for change sake is becoming more and more common and getting rid of extremely profitable businesses has become the norm instead of the exception.  Morale is tumbling and more people are waiting for the final death knell of the Weyerhaeuser Company to toll."
good,"I am an Administrative Assistant who handles filing of important documents, answering incoming calls and redirecting to the appropriate person, data entry, coordinating special lunches and business meetings, distributing faxes and incoming mail, and maintaining a clean and professions office."
good,Great place until it closed unexpectedly. Plant closed because it sat on prime real estate and was worth far more in sale than as a box plant.
good,"Weyerhaeuser has great benefits. Swing shift is hard to adjust to. The weather also  is an adjustment. The wages are fair, but they could be a lot better."
good,"When I started at Weyerhaeuser, it was a great place to work.  Very stable, good leaders with good vision, collaborative work environment.  All that changed when Weyerhaeuser decided to move their Federal Way headquarters up to Seattle--trying to fit into an environment that it was never suited for.  They also merged with a company called Plumcreek--unfortunately, this injected many new leaders into Weyerhaeuser that micro-managed and took away much autonomy for other senior employees and leaders that worked at Weyerhaeuser.  All in all, it's just not the same company it used to be with its great heritage and legacy.  Unfortunate really."
good,"My experience was from a long time ago 1993. Contracted to write a P/O A/P system, Very relaxed environment and very nice, professional people. Was a great contract."
good,"Great place to work and retire from if you are looking for mill work. Has everything from manual labor jobs, to heavy equipment, machine operators, and trade jobs."
good,graveyard with kids has put a lot of stress on myself. Wish I could balanc better but it has streesed me to wits end. I hope all the best. I just need more time with my family
good,"I started out as Admin Assistant to VP of IT Ops (see a pattern here).  But I loved working for him, we had a team of about 40 staff members (all technical, developers, QA, data center staff).  Was a fun job.  Same as before booking travel, meetings, events.  Track resources (headcount).  I was there for about 4 years and was promoted to an Admin Supervisor under the Marketing Dept."
good,"Like most large corporations, WY has gone to quarterly profit tracking which is fine except that the product takes 30-50 years to come to market.  Current management seems to lack strategic vision for the future and is driving quarterly profit at the cost of longer term strategic research.  Benefits are good and people are great, but environment and company culture is in constant state of flux."
good,"I was inside, so I worked 8-5 every day.  This was my first real job, so I learned to buy, sell, and manage things. Co workers were great to work with, managers, not so much."
good,I liked working there great safety program always feeding you work was done right just short handed and the union members were mostly production hands so maintenance got screwed.
good,"They have moved away from the paper industry and into the real estate, so their true colors are truly now showing. I would not ever consider going back to work for the."
good,Lay offs were often and unpredictable. Knowledgeable management.
good,Started my shift by meeting with all the machine men to discuss all problems and corrections..... I learned that Weyerhaeuser was a very  large and demanding company. Lots of good co-workers. The hardest part of the job was working rotation shift. They make safety meetings enjoyable. I like that they are very safety oriented. Good management.
good,Enjoyed the variety - interesting work - maintain offsite storage - benefits liaison - receivables - payables
good,"overall a decent job with good benefits. long hours at times, strick attendance program, bad if you have kids..."
good,"Weyerhaeuser is probably one of the best paying jobs for the area it's located and has good benefits. The management isn't the best, however, it's a paycheck."
good,long nights standing a machine for 10-12 hours dealing with wood and saw dust. sometimes you have to shovel the saw dust in the summer its hot and in the winter its cold
good,"I loved working for Weyerhaeuser. The crews are great. Working 16 hour days and no family time is hard to do, and it almost was like no one cared about your time."
good,Great place to work !The company had excellent management and great Maintenance team which made it an excellent place to work everyday. Whenever there were issues the management was quick to address them. This built employee confidence in the company.
good,Weyerhaeuser is a good company if you are the right fit. They do not appreciate individuality and have a tendency to micromanage. They expect you to fit a certain mold and act a certain way. Training is extensive and thorough. I should know since I wrote the majority of the job aids for my department and trained a number of associates in my position. It is a demanding place to work and they require a lot of flexibility and adaptability from their employees.
good,I worked for Plumcreek prior to the merger with Weyerhaeuser.  I enjoyed my time at Plumcreek and could not comment to much on Weyerhaeuser.  The job was tough but fare.
good,Great job but required a lot of driving to all of the different locations that were supported through the contract that I was assigned to throughout the length of the contract
good,Great place to work. They put family first and allow you to work in a relaxed enviromnent that creates a productive work force. Excellent co workers to be around daily.
good,Laid back safe place to work bosses were very helpful and cared about there crew  we had fun and got the job done  great compensation for the work we did
good,a nice place to work. got to make overtime. the environment was not always nice. cold in winter and hot in the summer. You worked on a line and team work was a must but not everyone carried their load.
good,"i enjoyed working there ,your coworkers are easy to get a long with. its a very fast paced job, sometimes u have to worked over if the plant has any down time."
good,"The atmosphere was very competitive, somewhat stressful yet fun. I was fortunate to have a great boss who was helpful with learning more about the products marketed and the customer base"
good,Enjoyed working with staff and employees.  Staff was accommodating and always willing to provide assistance and advice when needed. Duties assigned were not challenging enough for my experience.
good,International Paper Company bought Weyerhaeusers container division in 2008.  No longer in exsistence.  Fast paced high stress environment based on the commodity of forest products (paper).
good,Large corporate Company with the classic cubical environment. Other opportunities with in the company. largest engineered lumber company in north America.
good,"Job is close to home with good pay"
good,Worked here over 30 years ago.  The company is completely different today.  Reviewing this employer would be moot. I would be happy to discuss this further during an interview.  Please feel free to contact me if you would like to schedule an interview.  Thank you.
good,"I was an Associate Engineering. I thought the pay was reasonable, but I found myself committing most of my life to this stressful work environment (which I expected, so I wasn't too shocked). I normally would have no issue with this, but their was no sense of gratification that came along with it. The engineering and process managers were fantastic; they cared a significant amount about their employees and process. Though the bureaucratic structure of this large company seemed to always interfere with getting work done."
good,I had over twenty years with this company . Overall a good place to work.
good,As a company Weyerhaeuser is good to work for. It really depends on your position in the company as to whether or not they share information with you.
good,"I worked in Irving for this company about 13 yrs ago."
good,"•	a typical day at work"
good,"Excellent Work/Life balance, minimal overtime or night shift work, able to take off on holidays."
good,"Fair pay and benefits.  A fair company to work for.  Challenging work,"
good,A typical day was running the corrugator with 5 other guys. Had to label the product measure the product and do quality checks on each load. I was qualified to run everything on the press.
good,"Many hours of presentation work"
good,Good company previously but no knowledge of new companys value now.
good,"Work is sometimes dangerous, pay is good. too much overtime. Management is ok, some good, some bad"
good,Nice company to work for but was should to another firm. The new firm should little interest in people. It became a cut throat work environment
good,good paying job but really wont have a outside life beside holidays get good benefits and get vacations time after a year  job is easy and laid back but can become stressful if machine are not working like they supposed to
good,They had great working hours
good,Work was very hard and breaks were short and strictly enforced.  Co-workers were great to work with.  Pay was always very good and safety was taken very seriously.
good,Unless you have years in this is not the company to be with young children. You are faulted if the child gets sick or has a dr appointment when your not on FMLA and your not eligible for FMLA until you've been employed a full year .
good,"-A typical day at work was fast paced"
good,"Long hours all hours of day decent pay and decent benefits, good people to be around. Safety first environment. Benefit package day one. Must be self motivated due to mainly unsupervised work"
good,"It's a good place to work. They stay short handed. So you have to pick up the slack. They say they care about their employees, but they really don't. I like working there anyway"
good,My review is negative as I was part of a division that Weyerhaeuser sold off.  Little concern was given to the employees as the company management had decided to take the company in a radically new direction and was selling off pieces without regard to employees.
good,"During my 5 years working for Weyerhaeuser at the Natchitoches mill, I gained experience operations, working as an operator, lead, and supervisor.  This company is safety driven, operating with the highest standards and expectations.  During my time with the company, I received 3 safety awards under the Natchitoches Star Program.  Each day is similar on the production floor, starting with a pre-shift safety meeting and stretch, followed by a 12 hour shift. Daily goals were set high in expectations Conditions were cold in the winter and hot in the summer."
good,A typical day varies from day to day. The turn over rate can be an issue with that at times. I have learned how to drive another type of forklift and operate many different kinds of machinery. The management could use some improvement on handling various situations in the proper way. My co-workers were like family. The hardest part are the hours and having to switch from days to nights. I make decent money to provide for my family.
good,"Weyerhaueser Greenville "
good,"Good pay. A very fast pace and had to be responsible for all workers.  It was a very dangerous place, so we all had to safe and responsible for all."
good,"Challenging, productive, fast pace and rewarding. The work hours were very demanding."
good,Steady work with good benefits small crew could be difficult at times easy pace little supervision own boss worked swing shift steasy work for 10 years.
good,I recently started working for this company as a temporary employee contracted through Man Power. This company has many long term career opportunities.
good,The company as a whole is a decent company to work for. But at the management level it was in disarray. There has been a big turnover in the management depart lately maybe its better now.
good,"Although this was a temporary position, this was an AWESOME job/assignment. If I ever had written a script for dream job that you DIDNT have as a kid, this would be it. Ideal location and grounds . Did not meet another employee that I did not like. This is a sought after company in my opinion and after working here, I know why. I hated for my assignment to come to an end. I loved being here.Good people around me in my department too."
good,"hardest  part was long hours/lifting heavy boards"
good,"Management tried to promote with in.  They had a great mentor-ship program that helped advance hourly associates.  Tuition re-reimbursement program was an added benefit that helped many,"
good,This was factory work producing cardboard boxes which enabled me to learn additional skills as well as being a team worker.
good,It’s a job it has good benefits good people to work close to home many locations to transfer to if it’s possible 12 hour shift it’s not to bad unless it’s raining
good,"Worked with Weyerhaeuser over 10 years.  Overall a good company to work.  I've learned a lot working with this company and the management in my area were nothing less of impeccable.  They gave the best approach for advancement and left you with the sense that you work was appreciated.  Unfortunately, corporate leadership changed and most of what made the company great, slowly became of the past.  "
good,"I enjoyed working for Weyerhaeuser. The people on my crew were amazing for the most part. The shift was 4am-12pm, and it really took a toll on your body, but it was also nice to be done that early. The work environment was pretty good for the most part, some of the other crews didn't really acknowledge the crews around them. So we generally just stuck to ourselves."
good,When the position was in Boise we had wonderful management.
good,Weather determines your schedule. Great company to work for with excellent pay. Has been in business for years.
good,"Fora work day I would look at the schedule and see what we would have to run that day and get everything set up a head of time.And run the machine. I learned the Waxer, the Fleos, the Dye-cutters but there was different types of these machines but that had the same names. Management was really nice the plant manager would walk around everyday to see how everyone was doing, he even new all of our names by heart. Co-workers were alright, we were all kinda spaced out so we were never really side by side.The most hardest part of the job I would say would be keeping the ink a a constant thickness, because a lot of the time the ink would get either to thick or way to thin. We were treated in a fair way."
good,"Daily work environment was highly stressful.  Management promoted a highly stressful, competitive atmosphere between supervisors.  There was little or no help available on a daily basis. Quite often you were forced to work short handed and still meet timelines.  Maintenance did not have what they needed to keep equipment running.  They would have to make seals out of jelly jar lids on a regular basis."
good,"between management and union employees is a lot of conflict. makes it hard to just do your job."
good,Typical  day  was  repairing  the  saw  mill  for  the  next  week .Days were  long   and  lot  of  repairs  to  be  made . The hardest  part  of the job was to keep ever thing running saw mill are hard on the machines.
good,Safety is the #1 Priorty. My co-workers were like a big family and I enjoyed working with them. Management was always in the position to keep their employees frustrated. Like holding a carrot in front of your face that you could never reach. Their training program was a complete joke because there was none. Employees that had been with the company foe 10 years or more never was able to have a pay advancement because their so-called training program changed every year. Seemed like they wanted to keep their employees moral down.
good,good job for shift work. lots of overtime available. good overtime pay. after a couple month you feel the changes in day and night shift work. most of the team is great to work with. not the healthiest place to work tho.
good,"you can expect to work a lot of hours at this company, but that was because of the union protecting people who would show up late every  day for 3 years and not fire them, money was pretty good but they ran the stuff out of you, barely saw your family or kids"
good,"I answered a multi line phone system. Did payroll, accounts payable, accounts receivable, petty cash reconciliation, greeting public,worked with office machines, etc"
good,"plant hot in the summer cold in the winter, I learned a broad spectrum of the manufacturing industry while working with some great people and some not so great."
good,Started as a temp job but became a permanent employee and advanced to Environmental Compliance.  I learned the state and federal regulations required to do my job.  The hardest part of the job was leaving.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the independence I had as I had no peers.
good,"Good pay "
good,"There were so many senior employees at the time I joined the company.  However, all the business and workplace culture shifted and most of the employees lost their jobs."
good,"Good working conditions, and people. But when the work slowed down people got layed off."
good,Checking for defects in wood production. Also making sure everything is running correctly.  Housekeeping and cleaning on a regular basis. And staying focused.
good,Weyerhaeuser company was a great place to work at the time I worked for them. I was young and new to the work force and was lucky to get the job there when I did. After nineteen years I was heart broken to lose my job because of the economic down turn. I learned the hard way that there is life after Weyerhaeuser. Good bye Weyerhaeuser and Thank You.
good,A typical work day was fast paced and fulfilling. The continual quest for Improvement was life changing and engaging. The room for individual decision making was however restricted. Too much Micro Management.
good,"A place with communication, professionalism, courtesy, and was able to meet different people on a daily basis. Employment was relaxing and healthy environment."
good,"This company has some great qualities such as location to town, room for growth, training and advancement, as well as an average benefits program. However, it does turn a blind eye to health and safety when it comes to a few areas of the mill."
good,"Weyerhaeuser is a lumber mill located in Bruce, Mississippi.  It is a fast-paced work of life.  They have great benefits including dental and vision.  It is a great place to work."
good,"I truly enjoyed working as administrative support for this company.  The work was enjoyable and challenging with something new daily.  Adaptability is key working for this company.  Married to an operations technician/maintenance technician, I do have to say the shifts that they work are hard on the home life.  Divorces and a disruptive home life are ramped in the mill staff.  Management changes quite regularly making it difficult to become accustomed to any one priority.  However, if you like change and find it a challenge, this company could be a good fit."
good,Company is currently going through a restructure.  Strong capable work teams.
good,"standard helpdesk, imaged PC's, fixed End User issues. opened and closed tickets in a timely fashion"
good,"managed staff"
good,"good place to work, average work life and personal life balance, no room for advancement, great place to learn a trade, great co-workers, good time off"
good,I loved working at Weyerhaeuser really hated that I had to leave.  It's a great workplace with great supervisors and a great office staff they have a lot to offer and would be a great career
good,The job itself is pretty easy to learn. Operators do have some say in day to day operations. Switching from day shift to night shift each week can be difficult.
good,"Place was very inconsistent,  with sites being shut down left and right. Wanted us to relocate but would not give any kind of pay increase to compensate us to do so!"
good,It is a large company that has many opportunities.  They pay good salaries and benefits.  It was an enjoyable place to work with a cooperative work environment.
good,lot of pressure to get the volume for each week which was possible if no mechanical problems.management has not been good for 3yrs.but I did enjoy working for them for 36 yrs.
good,As a co-op this was a pretty good place to work. The only complaints are that benefits were limited. No paid sick days and no paid time off. Overall this made me a better engineering student.
good,"factory working environments aren't always the best but, management made a effort to make work and life safe as possible.  usually worked 6 to 7 days a week which left you with out a life but most people enjoyed the overtime"
good,learned to work with your work parteners. work together to solve problems. establish a good work enviroment. help the company advance in the work industry. make money to help take care of my family and finances.
good,"Siempre ocupada y aprendiendo muchas cosas, en mi caso hasta a planear y  dirigir un programa de producción, fué un excelente lugar de trabajo, si había gente muy dificil con la que se tenía que convivir pero eran pocos. Me gustó que el cliente era lo mas importante y la razón real del ser de la empresa."
good,"typical day there was fast pace, learned how to work different machinery and the hardest part is working in extreme temperatures  at times. the most enjoyable part is knowing i have a great team to work with with"
good,"I worked here during a difficult time, when the company was being pushed by investors to break apart. Then the housing crash happened and thousands upon thousands of layoffs and facility closures followed. It's now just a REIT as opposed to the Fortune 100 multi-national corp it once was. But at the time, very normal, buttoned-up but solid work culture."
good,"Weyerhaeuser has been a pretty good job for the most part the  jobs can be complex but after learning and getting into the routines and being safe everything becomes 2nd nature, but here recently they have been working on a new mill to get started up and ive been worried about job security so im job searching!"
good,Weyerhaeuser was an extremely safe environment to work in with a never ending opportunity for growth within the company. The management was very accommodating and helpful. Their salary and benefits package were exceptional.
good,"Maintenance is good if you enjoy maintenance and the position. Management is absolutely horrible. Their are too many people trying to make decisions that don't get made. Their is also lack of communication between them, and they don't know what's going on half of the time. The involvement with the employees needs to be increased and just more involvement overall."
good,Days go by pretty quickly. Constant steady work pace. Very understandable hours and shift. Lots of veteran knowledge and experience.
good,"This company allows opportunity for growth, Typical day consist of working with various machines to package different products.  Only cons of this company is that it can get very hot while working."
good,"This was a great company to work for.  They are very family oriented and compassionate when it came to emergencies with children or other family members.  The coworkers were fun yet hardworking.  The environment was casual and although we all worked very hard, we made it fun to come to work everyday."
good,"A good company to work for. Very safety conscious, and great benefits for the family. The pay is satisfactory as well. I've learned how to manage with a short crew, during stressful times, and have succeeded in all that has been in front of me."
good,"Good people to work with, especially in lower management.  Excellent support, great locations."
good,Was a great learning experience. Products I have never deal with. Always wondered when they would lay you off
good,"Enjoyed the outside, cutting rebarb, using the forklift throught the property"
good,"Teaching art to eager minds is a rewarding profession."
good,A typical day at Weyerhaeuser is always a learning experience
good,"The company  lives by SOP's . There is a job to be done , lets do it attitude. Pay was very fair"
good,"This was a great place to earn, but the hours could be brutal. The Cerritos plant shut down a few years ago."
good,"Although I've worked for Weyerhaeuser before, I am fairly new to this site. So far my new position is very enjoyable. I am responsible for the safe and efficient operation of heavy equipment (Portal Rail Crane, Loaders & Excavators)"
good,"A good company to work for, but they lack in employee development"
good,Received my basic training in credit and collections. Good management.
good,It provided a good learning environment to establish a good foundation
good,"The work environment was great, so was the managment. My supervisor was always willing to teach and help."
good,operate machine and make sure its was running to spec and the product what to customers desire
good,"Great pay and benefits. Security, that's what they gave me so I can raise my kids. I like weyerhaeuser bc they gave me a chance to belong to something and make a good living for me and my family."
good,They brought in a new maintenance and plant manager recently. They are bean counters and have cut the workforce in half in just a couple of months. Management is constantly looking to fire people. Most employees are in constant fear of termination.
good,Really enjoyed my time there. Management was fair and treated everyone respectfully. Workforce was friendly and helpful to each other and new employees.
good,"I started there as a kid and worked for 25 years, from clean up to management. I worked in all departments and put in a lot of hours."
good,I would look up and dispense parts to the mechanics as needed. I would check stock and take inventory.  we rotated 2 weeks day shift and 2 weeks night shift.
good,"I like my job but there is no room for advancement. The most enjoyable part of this job is the people and team that i work with, i like the work from home option."
good,"Job responsibilities were diverse - made it more interesting and fun."
good,"The work environment was small and not the best. The only great benefit was the health insurance I got for my family. Management at the location I worked at was poor and did show ""favoritism"" to certain workers."
good,"High energy, a lot of motivation & pride in producing newsprint at world record production rates. Export market good but domestic market issues. Newsprint is a declining market"
good,"Had a 30+ career with Weyerhaeuser and fortunately was able to retire before the company relocated to Seattle.  Thank Goodness!"
good,"Clock in, get coffee, picked up orders and hurried to job location. Half of the day was pulling orders, boxing them and palletizing. for pet store deliveries. Then restocking shelves in pet department."
good,Weyerhuaeser is not s great place to work but it is not a bad place to work.  The hours are hard but the pay is good. Some times I would have messages from family and they would not tell me I would find out when I got home my girl was sick in school and needed to be picked up. It happened more than one time too.
good,"Would run a Flexo machine working with cardboard and to tare down and set up machines. "
good,The job was a productive job with excellent benefits. The graveyard shift was all that I didn't like about the company
good,It was hard working with a company that had managers that weren't comfortable making important decisions pertaining to the company's IT well being.
good,I gained a lot of management knowledge and I'm happy with that.
good,Safety minded employer.  Provides a decent living wage.  Weekends and holidays off.  Busy industrial environments.  Management is like everywhere else  good bad and ugly
good,My team members helped me a lot to learn new technical things and helped me in handling resolving new issues that used to occur daily. We had daily and weekly meetings also.
good,Weyerhaeuser is a solid company to work for.  I recommend it.  There are serveral arees to work in as it is a huge employer in the timber industry. Working in HQ in downtown Seattle is really nice.
good,"Weyerhaeuser is an exciting and productive Company to work for. The company provides a welcoming atmosphere for all employees and customers. Management also provides training to help better understand the background/history of the company and products. A day working for Weyerhaeuser would be covering multiple external accounts, taking multiple calls from customer to provide product knowledge, pricing,  availability, and transportation options.  Building relationships with customers to land contracts to increase sales revenue."
good,"Until such time as they sold off the division I was supporting it was a good place to work.  If you see the words ""strategic review"" BEWARE!  That means your job may be on the chopping block."
good,Ups and downs. Lots of work to do. Mill management expects more work hours than you would think. Fair pay. Some really good people. Chances to learn abound.
good,"Work schedule sucks, two weeks day shift then rotate to two weeks night shift. 7:30 - 7:30"
good,"fast paced, good environment, good people to work with.  supervisor very helpful on training and implementation.  good company to work for.  benefits good, salary good."
good,This was a great working opportunity to become aware of the way businesses operate. This job gave me an understanding of how to keep track of inventory and how much time can be wasted if shipments are not accurate.
good,"In 2012 I started as the Safety Manager at Foster Veneer and picked up some very valuable skills which included OSHA compliance rules, safety auditing and intervention techniques with employees. The employees at Foster are a safe and productive group. The future of Foster Veneer is uncertain as it is currently up for sale. While I enjoy working at Foster Veneer, I'm not too sure what the future holds after the new owner takes over. I'm at a point where, after 25 years with this company, I'm ready to explore other options."
good,Had an employee that I couldn't work with that cost me my job. I didn't handle the situation correctly and could only move forward and learn from it. I greatly enjoyed my time there.
good,"Good Place to work, great benefits and management is strong. Normal day to day business, room for growth, challenging positions.  Only con is they tend to sell off divisions so there is always that chance of being bought out by a different company."
good,"The job itself is a factory job, however, the employees are wonderful, always looking for a pot-luck or something fun to do. Most employees are great at their profession and love to share their knowledge"
good,Job lost its luster in the later year . CEO changed the mind set and made the employees uneasy. Plant closure was going to happen with the CEO at the helm .
good,i run the dry kilns which means i dried the lumber that was to be used in buliding anything that was built with lumber also drove a cat 938g cat  loader for 17 years
good,I worked for Weyerhaeuser in the years before safety was the main concern. It was easy to get hooked on the money and find myself stuck in a job I really didn't enjoy. Weyerhaeuser Paper Division has since been sold to International Paper.
good,"Working at a plant, the work life balance is hard for my family and I. As I am currently the graveyard supervisor, the overnight hours do not work with my family and I."
good,"layoffs occur every couple of years.  my manager has been wonderful to work with over the years.  changing culture, out with the old and in with the new."
good,work on break downs when they happen. Work on PM's rest of the day
good,"Hardworking environment to work, very fast pace & the staff are good people to work with."
good,Great place to work. We were sad to see it close. Very heavy on leadership development and customer service.
good,The company is very safety oriented. They are concerned for there workers and the union helps in most circumstances. They try to provide a work/life balance but can come off as company minded at times.
good,good place to work  just bad timing for me. was going through a divorce at the time. we were married 24 years and I never seen it coming. overall a good place to work
good,"Safety is key, if you keep a safe work space your job will always run smoothly. Communication is very important out here, whether it be personal or business. Management is alright."
good,"you will work a lot of hours"
good,It’s was a great experience I only worked for the summer it paid well to only be a temp just I stacked wood at what they call the round table it’s hard work
good,The work I performed at Weyerhaeuser was quick paced and dead line based.  It was stressful but enjoyable to be able to help people.  I worked with some strong and intelligent people.
good,Really learn a lot about the industry and a great environment to work in. The workplace culture was very family oriented. the management team really cared about the employee.
good,The pay and benefits were not bad. Most of the managers were fair. The hardest job in the facility was clean up. The people at the facility made the place.
good,"busy summer work, co-workers were help full and friendly.  most of the day you are on forklift building orders to ship for the next.  hardest part was the hours."
good,At the distribution site I learned production and shipping planning as well as how to manage high volumes of on site inventory. The people were great to work with and the leadership was in the organization was complimentary.
good,If you are proactive and willing to put the effort in you can move up the ladder very fast. Everyone is willing to help if there are questions that arise.
good,My typical day consist but not limited to maintaining the right oil temperature to supply heat to the drying kilns. Constantly doing visual check on hot Thermal Oil Units looking for any type of spills or leaks.
good,"Weyerhaeuser is a good company to work for.  Due to technology, downsizing, and restructuring of the company, I lost my job.  We were ahead of many companies in our records practices. I worked and teamed with wonderful people throughout the company in different departments."
good,The most enjoyable part of job is the people I worked around they were very helpful and easy to get along with. Weyerhaueser is the type of company that is real big on safe if you couldn't work safe you wasn't working at all.
good,Work is repetitive with lots of good people to work with.  Benefits are good with limited opportunity for advancement.  No one is looking over your shoulder and you get the chance to create your own work day.
good,"The employees there are fun to work with, you have the opportunity to move up in entry levels. Its a production company that deals with lumber."
good,This was my first job out of college and it taught me a great deal. the leadership preached safety first and i can truly say thats culture that we cultivated. the only con was that the salary didnt equal time amount of time that I was spending there each week.
good,working there was great you are always moving always busy and the safety is number one  the air quality could be better  people with breathing issues shouldn't work there. but if your looking for good people  good teachers and well payed then its great
good,"Some of my day to day duties included,	assisting maintenance and purchasing, issued parts at the tool crib window,used gauges, rulers, micrometers as needed, assisted with the unloading of vending and lumber trucks with a forklift, used computer based programs to order, ship, and receive parts and cycle count every day. My co-workers were excellent people to work with. There was not a hard part of my job. I enjoyed my job very much. I love interacting with people face to face on a daily basis."
good,"I have worked here for 2 years and it have been a rollercoaster ride with layoffs and moving to Seattle but I enjoyed it.You will learn so much about trees it is amazing but quite interesting. The compensation is average, pay is good for the area but benefits and vacation are not great. The company tries to do things throughout the year to keep employees involved such as a yearly picnic and a diaper drive. Good place to work but it is unfortunately they will be leaving the beautiful campus and building behind in Federal Way and moving to the crowded area of Seattle."
good,Weyerhaeuser was a great company to work for.  They are in the process of changing their culture - which is both difficult and exciting.
good,Working a I2 hour day was common but the people I worked with made it easier.
good,Weyerhaeuser provided support via management and education opportunities which enabled me to advance throughout my career
good,Running the drafting department and responding to work request and building needs among the Weyerhaeuser community.
good,"Fresh out of the service, so everything was interesting"
good,"Company has high ethical standards, is well-managed and has alot of great employees, but not as many as it did just a few years ago."
good,This was my first actual supervision job - learned alot of employees personalities. Worked on job approvals and lay outs
good,Liason between Weyerhauser production and Kodak production. Working out requirements and planning production.
good,"This was the best job I've had. Far and away, the best coworkers and management I've had. Management that actually listens to its employees and will implement their ideas to create a smoother work process (if positively reviewed by a committee consisting of maintenance, one worker from each shift, management, and HR). Supervisors that would trust their employees' abilities to do their jobs and not hover all over or spy on you."
good,This company is very big on the Safety of all it's employees. It's the number one priority there. It's always been more like working in a family environment here with this company because they have a genuine concern for it's employees and fellow co-workers. The down side of working here  at times is poor leadership.
good,Great place to work. Just have to be careful to know that some grown men act like children and others union brothers will stab you in the back. As long as you do your job you should be alright. Managers are always watching to write you up.
good,I belive in the Recycling movement and was excited to be a part of it.  I felt a part of the movement and enjoyed the company.  I was a victem of the market and when the market went down it kicked me out.  I hold Weyerhaeuser is hi regard and thank them for the opportunity to work there.
good,Work schedule is 4 on 4 off you work 4 days on then you are off 4 then you go back and work 4 nights then it just flip flops. Other then that it’s a good place to work.
good,"Professional run organization with emphasis on safety first"
good,"Good people to work with, training is great but the work can be hard if you have a strong work ethic, if your lazy its not bad. Pay is extremely low especially if you come from the oil patch to the mill, very hard to make a living unless you have absolutely no payments and maybe a wife working. It was nice to have a beard but they make you trim it after 4 inches lol but the best thing about working there is you're home every day and once you leave the mill there's no phone calls or Emails about your shift you just punched. It was hard getting use to 30 minute lunch break and two 15 minute breaks over a 12 hour shift because you stand most of the day and throw around green lumber. Great starting career for someone just out of high school because they have a great retirement plan, I wouldn't recommend starting there if you are in your 40's or 50's. Very safety sensitive place to work, lots of saws and moving equipment, no exceptions to lock out tag out when doing maintenance. If you don't follow rules the mill is not for you."
good,"Good job, pretty good pay if you put in the overtime and benefits are diminishing.  Will be not good at all in 2020. Health insurance deductibles are going sky high in a yr. Good vacation accrual and paid holidays..home everyday. Lots of overtime available usually if you want it"
good,"I rate my training a 10, and it was continuous.  I learned a lot from Sales and Operations Dept. Operations employees complained about raises, they were minimal, at the same time Weyerhaeuser took care of everyone's needs. "
good,had potential for promotion and upward mobility; hardworking environment though. Was a joy to work there had very motivating managers and what could be considered a family environment.
good,"Work was good there, just needed a change of scenery,got along with all of my co workers, management could have been a little better in the auto shop.. not so one sided"
good,This is a great job for people looking to do some physical labor with opportunities to move around to different job stations. Lots of great people there.
good,I began there immediately after graduating and only left because I was relocating to the Lower Mainland.  It was a great experience and thoroughly enjoyed the co-workers.
good,"Worked with a great team of employees and learned a lot about the practical use of SAP for shipping, inventory and maintenance planning. Learned a lot about safety and safety compliance when working at the Albany ELP site. Really enjoyed my time there."
good,fast pace environment has to meet some expected numbers for production safety is priority number one but at the time time everything it's so fast you have to pay attention to everything
good,"I really enjoyed working for the company. The atmosphere and management was really good. Eventhough, I worked for a temporary company, thought that I would be brought on fulltime for the company. I was laid off, but they wanted to bring me back after the layoff as temporary. No job security."
good,"I respect the team I manage for their dedication and hard work.  It is very cyclical work load and very difficult at times, but they all are professional and hard workers."
good,Supervisors were promoted with-in. I really liked working here. The hours were good. We worked some weekends. I enjoyed the cross training so i wasn't on the same machine all the time.
good,Weyerhaeuser is a good company to work for. They are very safety oriented and work to keep a good mill. They are a driving force in the wood products industry.
good,"Each day was different. While tasks were consistent, the process in which the tasks were completed was varied.  Flexible work schedule permitted in most departments. Department supervisor did not micro-manage and was readily available to discuss concerns. Most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers, who  did not mind assisting in other areas if needed."
good,A great place to work. Open minded management. Employees are friendly. They promote from within. I learned the process of making different length boards.Hardest part of the job was being at work for 5am.
good,"Constant churning of whether we are growing, shrinking, centralizing, de-centralizing by upper management is just plain tiring. For employees that have been here for awhile, they just roll their eyes. Each change is just what previous senior manager tried before - its just another turn of the wheel. Hopefully, this current SMT will stay focused on their current approach."
good,"Typical day includes dealing with prospective buyers, map work, updating data base. I learned to manage multiple transaction effectively and how to leverage positions. We were given freedom to do the job and meet goals. Co-workers are very good to  work with everyone assist one another. Hardest job is dealing with changing conditions that come down from corporate. Most enjoyable part of job is making good sales and making good acquisitions."
good,"Trouble shoot hydraulic and mechanical systems, daily checks, work orders and PM's, fabricating guarding, etc"
good,"Love the people and the flexibility of work schedules, but seems a never-ending carousel of divestitures and layoffs. Not the most secure work environment anymore."
good,"this is a good place to work. great benefits, nice people to work with. It is difficult to move up or around with in the company."
good,"very boring job, not challenging enough. Great coworkers, good pay and benefits. Long hours but had 3 day weekends. supplied everything to do my job."
good,Great company to work for.  Plenty of opportunity to move up and take on new challenges.  Always willing to teach people new skills and promote them
good,With the trucks always coming and going it was never dull. Everybody knew what needed to be done and you did it. If you needed a hand there was always help.
good,"Weyerhaeuser is a safety driven company which is always looking to improve efficiency and profitability through Lean tools and employee involvement. Over the past 5 years I have been able to acquire a vast amount of knowledge in respect to management, profitability, and product distribution through company mentoring sessions and real time decision making situations."
good,"A typical day at work includes socializing and collaborating with coworkers.  I learned much about collaboration, leadership styles, and how to do more with less resources.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with good people."
good,"Decentralization and downsizing are key cultural focus right now with many people being laid off in the process."
good,"I worked 8-10 hours a day and loved my job, benefit, my co-workers, and customers I worked with. I believed in the company and the products, innovation, and  professionalism found at all levels. The company had a long time, solid foundation in supporting the work life balance of it's employees, until the recent change in leadership which has shifted it's philosophy on the topic drastically."
good,"No fixed workday as long as it's 8 hours. Many opportunities to educate yourself in other positions. Everyone seems happy to be there and is focused on working for the common good. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job is the variety of work one is required to do, sometimes other work takes priority over what you were just doing and you need to set it down and shift gears quickly."
good,"Had a great time, great team to work with! Learned a great deal from co-workers and management that can be carried over to a new position."
good,"very long hours, learned how to process lumber ,team work crucial .Company had production incentives, safety incentives"
good,Every day was a typical day.hardest part of the job was to meet quota but found it challenging.
good,This company believed in balancing work and family. Always encouraged furturing education.
good,"I spent each work day visiting different manufacturing sites to analysis business practices, primarily in the maintenance organizations.  I created improvement plans and initiated training for site leadership.  I implemented measurable goals to encourage success."
good,One of the best places I have ever worked. They make family first then work. They are very customer focused and will go the extra mile to keep their customers satisfied!
good,I enjoyed going to work everyday. It was a safe and friendly environment.
good,"Excellent upper management, poor plant level management. advancement potential is available."
good,Flexibility is provided if needed.  Collegiate atmosphere.  Supportive although exact performance metrics are generated and expected to be accomplished
good,Working there was a very great learning experience. You get all the training  you need and will help you out in the long run. I do think they just need to change rotation shift. I think it is bad for your health switching from days and nights.
good,"As a trainee in the operations management role, I was able to work with various leaders on projects around the site which in turn allowed me to learn and grow greatly in my time there."
good,There is always room for improvement.  I believe more diversity and inclusion needs to be seated at the table. Management needs to understand the various stresses at the employee level.
good,"This was my first job, and it was a good place to get work experience. The pay was great for the time. Required me to work out of town for  a week at a time."
good,"Typical day at work is to clean area, cut lumber, unload and load trucks. I learned how to work with people as a team. Strong safety culture. Good management. Hardest part of job is time management."
good,"As a Utility Relief employee you would operate all the machines and off bear multiple machine areas. Therefore you could work wherever needed or bid on opposite shifts, if you wanted overtime."
good,This was a great place to work during the time. There was no room for advancement. I need something more challenging and needed a place to use my experience of Machine operation.
good,A good company that treats people well.  A company that takes care of it's people and supports the growth of their staff.  A good supplier of corrugated products across the United States.
good,The work environemt was fast pced but all in all it was a great learning experience. I learned how important teamwork was to properly ensure that production was at its hoghest level possible.
good,"this was awesome job , I really felt empowered to make my own decisions also I ran the safety program there and I felt the truly believed in the union stance"
good,Great place to work. Great benifits great enviroment good pay fast paced dirty wood logs hot surfaces great leadership vacation would recomend to anyone
good,Care about their people and the environment.  Focused on making a great product while keeping employees happy. Great benefits. Management would bend over backwards for hard workers.
good,Weyerhaeuser is okay for the most parts. I am not too fun of working 16 hours (when I am expecting to only work 12 hours); all because my release did not come to work.
good,"The culture of treating customers, vendors and employees with the greatest respect and care created a great workplace environment. Managers were genuinely interested in your success."
good,nice place to work really enjoyed co workers. opportunity for over time working as a maintenance helper. also lots of cross training on other machinery available.
good,"While Weyerhaeuser expects you to complete your job and add value, you receive recognition for doing a good job. Poor people principles do not seem to be tolerated. Excellent management team."
good,"Weyerhaeuser is an old company that has gone through many changes and iterations during its 100+ years.  It is undergoing a contraction phase and focusing their energy on forests and land management.  This has caused many organizational changes and layoffs. Prior to this phase, it has been an great company to work for, with high-quality employees.  I've enjoyed the many challenges presented during my employment with Weyerhaeuser."
good,High paced work place in which everyone communicates and helps one another with intent that everyone shall help everyone succeed and maintain daily business functions.
good,"Great Development. They strived to development employees, provided opportunities for advancement, cross training and temporary assignments. Good benefits."
good,EVERYTHING there is very fast paced with a whole lot to do. Sometimes you have to push your breaks/lunch back just to get your required production done. No one wants to help when its needed because it will set them back. NO TEAMWORK AT ALL
good,Great safe place to work. Flexible work schedule and good pay. It is a family ordinate place that allows you to put family 1st. Also VET friendly an National Guard friendly.
good,"Fast paced, high stress, relatively dangerous work but it is indoors with fans blowing. Hard manual labor with required breaks. Safety is stressed and you are trained to put it first."
good,was geat to work for positive people and great environment management was great they supported you and helped ou out  whenever u needed also a safe place to work
good,"was great working their good pay, and benefits, union job people willing to teach you and are good for safety. the only reason I left was allergies good rotation of night and days"
good,"the employees were very good at their job and stayed a long time,  Management pushed safety and profits.  Very good to work for and lots of benefits.  Enjoyed."
good,"The company overall was large and with many resources.  The plant I supported was small enough to maintain a family environment.  Promoted team activities, and support on all levels."
good,I worked here during a two week shut down and therefore it is hard to give a truthfull opinion of what it is reallly like to work there full time as a regular employee.
good,"A typical day at work started with a morning management meeting, safety review, daily instruction activities review, shift meeting, safety review, daily instruction activities review, control room and floor activities check. I learned all stages of the process and management skills."
good,"Weyerhaeuser purchased the smaller company I worked for in 1999.  Weyerhaeuser was a huge company and we transitioned thru many changes that were mostly positive.  I had to learn how to turn a big ship as opposed to a row boat.  I found the ""new to me"" co-workers very helpful. "
good,"Great team work ,everyone pulls there own weight, Good job/life balance. Structured so that an employee can flourish and improve for career advancement."
good,"The business I worked in was grounded in TQM and high performance work systems.  Great team work and camaraderie with innovation coming from all areas of the business: manufacturing floor, engineering, technical service, sales, and of course product development.  Highly export sensitive and sells into some very competitive commodity markets."
good,"If consistency and continuity is something people are looking for, the mill life is the choice. Simple work, nothing too strenuous. An overall good job, however management and supervisors as well as HR were so misguided and corrupt that it ultimately lead to my decision to leave."
good,"safety is their number 1 priority and not just words but adhered to by all. team concept is a reason for their success. I would and have recommended to many that if they had the opportunity  to work there, go for it."
good,Weyerhaeuser is a good company to work for.  The work is interesting and the compensation is good.  Longview is a large manufacturing complex.
good,"Management good with this company, only worked short time for rebuild."
good,"A typical day for me was 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 pm. except on Friday which was usually a 10 hr. day. I learned over the years that every person is important and has a contributtion to make for the company success. All phases of management trusted me to do the job. I scheduled all production, finishing and shipping for the mill. Sales dept. depended on me to see that these things happened. Of all jobs this one was surely one that depended on great communication. This was done by phone, e-mails, computer programs, faxes , logs and other means. The hardeset part of my job was when I had to see someone get terminated. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing employees blossom and get promoted."
good,"Well established company"
good,A typical day would involve setting up various jobs at my machine center and preparing for upcoming jobs. I learned a lot about the corrugated industry in general. I also learned many things about corrugated board conversion and printing specifically. The management was hands-on and knowledgeable. The co-workers were professional and very nice people. The hardest part of the job was the extreme heat in the plant in the summer time. The most enjoyable part of the job was troubleshooting specific problems and fixing them during a job run.
good,Amazing culture of caring that encourages employees to grow and advance.
good,"I grew up there.  Spent 35 years of my life there.  Worked in the ""Timberlands"" section, where we planted, managed, and protected the forests from insects, fire, and so much more.  I moved from Jacksonville to New Bern, NC, where I trained and grew in education, computer uses, created and maintained many, MANY statistics, etc.  It used to be a good place to learn and grow, but I've been away for many years, and am not familiar with the inner-workings now..."

good,high moral and great people i loved working for this company
good,"At Weyerhaeuser people are treated as adults, management recognizes that everyone works as hard as possible but also have personal lives. I have learned so much during my 33 yrs experience with this company because I was able to have so many opportunities with different departments. The people I worked with were the best, not just co-workers but also became good friends."
good,"This company was the second best placed that I worked. But, things changed when they downsized."
good,Will never give anything for the intense training in terms of total quality management and an understanding of what it meant to be an HR Change Agent in a manufacturing environment.
good,"excellant place of employment ,company closed doors without telling anybody until about a week before it happened,bad management"
good,Checked quality on products before shipped to distributors.Placed departmental labels on products.

good,"Enjoyed working at Plum Creek Timber.  The Risk Management position was responsible for all operations, including Mills, land management, oil and gas and timber.  My manager was great to work for and I learned a tremendous amount.   Sadly the company was purchased and they removed all of the administration people."
good,"A typical work day consisted of completing log sheets every two hours and other required reports. Shutting down/starting equipment as necessary for maintenance, responding to process upsets (ex. a boiler trip) and managing all utility requirements for the continuous operation of the pulp mill. Also assist operators on my shift with operation of various auxiliary equipment (helping/managing crew of about 8 persons), attend shift safety and operational meetings, answer radio, phone and computer messages."
good,Enjoyed working at Weyerhauser. I learned alot and was allowed to advance while using the skills that I currently and learn new ones at the same time.

good,"Weyerhaeuser was a great place to work. The company pays you extremely well, you are offered 2 weeks paid vacation whenever you want at the beginning of the year, and the benefits are high-coverage. The shiftwork as an associate was very difficult to adjust to, however."
good,"The workplace was very good. Almost all the managers were good and handled things in a professional way. Usually people who are bullies do nt last long. The union here is amazing and very strong. The great atmosphere this workplace has is almost entirely due to all the great hourly workers and the union. However, they have some amazing managers too. Production work is not too labour intensive and interesting."
good,Your job depends on how the mill is running. Some days it is great the next its wide open from start to finish. Working here is great due to the team/ work family here. This is a special place in that regard.
good,This was one of the best companies I have worked for.  Huge company with excellent compensation and benefits.  Management was good.  Really liked almost everything about this company.
good,Daily tasks consisted of the trimming and cutting of lumber for the consumers. I learned to work with various types of devices to ensure precision on lumber.

good,I moved out of state and was never able to work for this company permanent.  The atmosphere was always good and people were always willing to help you when you needed it.
good,"Weyerhaeuser has been a very good company to work for over the years.  As with most other companies, they have downsized and changed into a leaner organization. They are also re-inventing themselves.  I have worked with a lot of fantastic people here over the 15 years I have been here.  When you work in the voice/data field, you should always have the desire to learn new technology.  Weyerhaeuser has afforded this opportunity to me."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the culture that is built by the company. "
good,I was an employee at Weyerhaeuser for over 35 years. I had good supervisors and not so good supervisors and co workers. We had 3 shifts and at one time or another I worked all of them. Overall it was a positive experience.

good,"Supervise staff of 12 (Goals,Reviews, and day to day duties.)"
good,A typical day started at 5:00 am and ended at 5 pm working with an amazing shipping crew of 8. What I learned as I grew in the company was to treat people like you want to be treated. My co-workers in shipping and I were together for 18 years and worked like a well oiled machine. The hardest part of the job was when my company downsized their salaried staff and my job was eliminated. I was an employee who loved what I did and valued the people I worked with. together we grew not only in years but in the way we accomplished our daily tasks and learned to respect the differences in all of us and move forward.
good,"Working at this location will help just about any carrier. Keep in mind the work load can be tough, but through helpful team members all tasks are possible."
good,This company is a great company to work for. Pay is good and the benefits you receive here are top of the line. Some of the downfall to this job is it’s always hot and you work long hours and it’s a rotating schedule. Have to work a lot of days off also.

good,"Real cool job relaxing and not that much you have to worry about other then your work and you can learn a lot from working at this job. "
good,Management is awful.  Wrong people in high positions who got there because of friendships instead of earning the position. Supervisors are not trust worthy and will not stand up for workers. If they do they are immediately fired
good,Great work teams within the company.  Co-workers were easy to work with in all departments.  Able to work remotely on occasion.  Workloads manageable.
good,"I loved working for Weyerhaeuser but our IT department was out sourced to another company and we had no choice. We did the same job, sat in the same chair but got our pay from a different company."
good,"I Worked as a consultant, not a employee.  While I had access to vital information and resources, I was not eligible for many of the companies programs."
good,"Team, Company working environment is good and also manager co-operation of fine."
good,People are great. fast paced and helpful employees. good mentors. great environment. The workplace is on-top of everything and is efficient to repair and maintain the work place.
good,Challenging work environment with plenty of opportunity. Allowed me to learn from many other established leaders. The company culture is supportive in promoting reaching out across the company for resources.
good,Pay is competitive and the environment is welcoming and enjoyable. If this is your thing you will be happy here for a long time. Job is pretty specific though and will not provide a plethora of transferable skills.
good,Good pay. I would recommend Weyerhaeuser to anyone looking for work. The pay was really good for the area with a good benefit package. It was a shame to see the mill sell in Sweet Home.
good,Weyerhouser is a very relaxed enviroment slow pace. Not a hard job but one of those that time moves slow. easy money staff is welcoming would recommend to friends
good,"Trabajo sobre presión porque la fábrica no debe detenerse salvo en los mantenimientos programados como preventivos, el perfil del comprador es organizado, ordenado y anticipado para que los materiales e insumos que se necesitan para la producción se encuentren siempre disponibles; el control del almacén se llevaba estandarizado para no tener inconvenientes que afectaran el proceso. "

good,"Perfect place for work part time on summer, winter, and spring. Leasy to apply and no far from home ."
good,"lot of responsibility"
good,"Rarely ever early mornings except for meetings.  This is because in those days most all my appointments were done in peoples homes in the evenings.  Usually in the office around 11 or so at that point setting up and turning in loans from the night before.  Then it would be follow up with my processor on my existing loans and perhaps meetings with underwriters or funders on pipeline issues.  The balance of the afternoon would be setting up appointments for the evening or following days.  Usually out of the office around 3 or so to visit with some Real Estate offices before the dinner hour, Then hopefully I had 1 or 2 loan appointments scheduled for the evening."
good,well when you are in maintenance you work every week end there not much time for family the company has great benefits and pay for a job in this town
good,"Standard office routines, weekly reports, and incoming call volumes that had a volume of 500-600 per day.  The hardest part of the job was understanding the switchboard to send out the calls to the proper offices in a quick and efficient manner."
good,It's a very good learning curve for me to understand Federal Government and Private sector organization work style.
good,Weyerhauser is a great place to work if you enjoy working in high stress conditions and night shift. They pay very well and ensure safety before production attitude. Don't recommend it as a life career because of night shift but very good to quickly get ahead with little or no school.
good,I enjoyed working here but I was not able to move up in the company. I enjoyed the work and was able to move to maintenance after being there for 5 years.
