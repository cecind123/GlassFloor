bad,customers are stupid and mean; management are bullies - they do not let you use the restroom unless you have a medical note and no absence is ever excused! they refused to give out raises and pulled our bonuses even though a number of us are consistently 100% qa and early to work and late to leave. we also no longer are paid for the 6 holidays we were paid for each year and its mandatory that we take off 12 - all without pay.  they then wonder why theres a high turnover and overwhelming mistakes
bad,"Beware of HR jobs... not a good place to work.  Cameras in the company vehicles to monitor your driving.  Pre-employment and random drug screens, different hours everyday, a lot of travel, no mentorship, and little appreciation.  There exists a lot of politics, games, gossip, blaming others... it’s not a good environment.  Not a place to develop or grow in HR for sure.  But good for field workers, it’s good. They get regular raises and decent time off.  Health Insurance is expensive but They have really good disability plans and pension."
bad,"The company has a lot of turnover in their HR dept in Phoenix.  Obviously there are issues with the management team when people don’t stay more than 3 years.  They won’t address employee concerns but keep people around that are frauds."
bad,"This company is extremely top-heavy.  There are many, many managers that are put in place to coordinate the use of web-based application systems and contractor agencies.  Half of the staff are contractors which means no benefits (health or otherwise) are offered by this company that I considered at one time to be a staple to the community.  There was no formal training; the supervisor has no idea how the department runs; it was TABOO to reach out to the supervisor for help but now I know why; and management tend to use the concept of hiring contractors as a way to overshadow their lack of involvement and engagement within the company.  I suppose it is easier to get rid of a contractor than a permanent employee - the messy and tedious requirement to justify the termination with HR is taken away.  Overall, as a utility company servicing three western states it was appalling to see how much money is arbitrarily tossed around by way of insignificant supplier contracts and consulting - there is a massive amount of ""consulting"" happening in this company that's been around forever which begs the question: why would a company doing business in the same region for over 40-50 years require consultants to run their daily operations?  Overall, there is zero managerial support for the people who keep things moving which begs the question of why those supervisors and managers are on kept in place to begin with.  Supervisors and managers should be available to guide and direct the employees but if the supervisor has no idea how the department functions then ... ?  Overall, with the amount"
bad,Caution! Ask questions.  Some people are nice and work with you.
bad,"I used to love my job until i was forced out of my job with Southwest due to management. Some if not all of the managers discriminate against minorities, and its sad that it’s not a secret amongst several different departments. Do not be fooled by some of the benefits, yes they are nice, and the people you work with are great. However, management and HR are suspicious in their tactics and this company will forever leave a bad taste in my mouth. Good Luck especially if your a minority and you get hired there."
bad,"I had to go straight to my desk, and start work; I was told by management that I am not to talk to anyone, and they were told not to talk to me. My coworkers were great, and were not under the same restrictions. They didn't understand why I was treated like that."
bad,Southwest Gas is a good company who is well established in the community.  They are very busy and you be able to handle a large work load.  They have good benefits and discounts available to employees.
bad,"Clickish. Don't get sick, as they will throw you out like yesterdays newspaper (mine was cancer). Demanding, inept management. People sleep on the job without consequence. Very poor safety culture. No longer a family-oriented workplace. Production is king. Greed is God. 40 hours is now the bare minimum, more is expected."
bad,"Typical Utility Work "
good,"My boss was a micro-manager, additionally, he was a untrustworthy individual.  One never knew which way the wind would blow from day to day.  He is gone now, following being caught in an affair with one of the staff.  I did not like the position."
good,"Pros: Pension plan, more focus on employee health and better living"
good,"The work day was from 7am-5pm, normally.  I learned mechanical s skills and time management. My co-workers were great and always willing to help.  The hardest part of the job was remembering all rules and procedures.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working independently and meeting and talking with people."
good,Don’t care to write a review. My separation from southwest Gas was not voluntary so I care to expand. Not going to say anything else here. The money was good.
good,"As is what is expected from utility company jobs, they are low paying, but they are very stable.  I met some people that had been working with the company for over 30 years."
good,Automotive service writer. Helped with automotive needs and tire services and oversee work was completed.
good,"Southwest Gas corporation is a great company to work with. The only con that I have with the company is that they are not receptive to new ideas, which I believe is sad."
good,"Very solid company that does.care.about people.  "
good,"Each district varies, and each department of that district varies. From my perspective, however, a running theme is that most of upper management tends to be baby-boomers, a generation which usually tends to come with an authoritarian-style of thinking. Many of them have worked nearly thirty years with this company and many of them are still left in the workforce and are soon approaching retirement.  The Company has put its management through lots of training to include personality training and trust training, but it seems like some of the older management resist change. I feel this generation of management needs to retire and make way for generations after them that value having a voice, work-life balance, transparency, and trust. I feel this is one of hardest parts of the job to deal with. Also, the workload can be heavy. Many projects can be going on and the workload can increase, and it is unlikely the company will hire more help. If you catch on quick and are good at what you do, do not expect a pat on the back - instead, expect a larger workload. This can quickly lead to burn-out. Additionally, some departments and managements are on-call for emergency responses, however, for non-salary employees, the overtime is good. Other than that, you can learn many valuable and transferable skills no matter what department or position you are hired for. No two days are the same, and there is often something new to learn. I feel the most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you make with other team members in your district and in other districts. Corporate headquarters is"

good,"They pay very well for their job descriptions. You have to have very tough skin to deal with the work environment, especially if you are a minority. They have a lot of perc working for the company. You get to travel to different places while working there."
good,"Typical corporate utility job.  Not terribly fast paced, and fairly structured as it is regulated.  But, did get a chance to do some interesting stuff, and was left on my own to do it."
good,"To work in a manor along with other employees"
good,"Great benefits, great hours.  But such a typical bureaucracy that it wears you down week after week, month after month, year after year."
good,"If you were in the in crowd, you are golden, if not, you are not treated the same."
good,Staying out of hierachy drama and games. It is a good place to work with a lot of room for advancement and relocation. The company is located in three states which is a plus.

good,I was happy there at first but the nature of the work is stressful. They don't open new positions often.
good,"I worked in different positions"
good,"Southwest Gas was an awesome internship and gave some background into the regulated gas utility industry.  I personally found the work a little monotonous at times but it was to be expected as it was an internship position, not a paid full time engineering position"

good,"Arrive to work, review emails retrieve invoices from a shared file to  begin the process of invoicing. "
good,This is a great company with awesome employees however their Management/Supervisor positions have to be desired as to how upper management allows lower management to do things not all the same way there for things across the board are not all the same for all employees.
good,"They treated me well. Its a utility, heavily invested in safety.  They keep employees and avoid turnover as best possible."
good,To work at Southwest Gas is a great opportunity. The benefits are great and the work environment is very positive. However when the work load is heavy shifts are very long and the end of a shift is never predetermined. The work itself if very satisfying in every aspect. Having the opportunity to work with customers and outside agencies is a great experience. The knowledge and skill gained through this position is immeasurable.

good,very productive with a wonderful atmosphere. the people are so friendly and always eager to help when needed. everyday i continue to learn about all the different departments that make this place so wonderful
good,Great company that values its employees and is one of the few that still offers a pension. The workplace offers quiet and privacy that is perfect for me and allows me to focus without distractions.
good,Everyday was a new challenge. it was a family atmosphere. You are expected to be professional at all times. Given a lot of trust to make your own decisions. Moral was great. There where times were you are mentally challenged.
good,"Start early and leave late, unless prior arrangements were made. Fun and stressful at the same time. New management may need a little more training when it comes to handling employees.  Hardest part of the job is dedicating your life to knowing that you will be working hard and a lot every day.  The reward is definitely there however. Best part of the job was dealing with customers, both residential and commercial."

good,A typical day at work would be getting straight to task at hand. Doing my job with little or no supervision. What  I learned was how to work in a dangerous work environment. Co-worker were team players and excellent to work with.The hardest part of the job was working and hazardous environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was working the companies trucks.
