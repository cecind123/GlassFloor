rating,review
bad,A reason why this place closed. AWFUL company to work for. CEO took millions before jumping ship because he knew this place was closing. No respect for it's employees.
bad,"Management was a joke, the company bankrupted and closed our store and all others with not much notice. No severance was given to long-time employees. Overall a not great time."
bad,Company closed due to lack of forward movement with on-line and store pick-up services.  Did not stay up to customer demands and confused customers with excessive coupon combinations.
bad,"Company no longer in business, but was great to work for.  Unfortunately, the company was unable to sustain itself during the retail downturn.  Learned valuable skills."
bad,Lack of understanding 4 people who work differently then other people. Disapprove of those who work slower then most people. There were no free lunches or snack vendors.
bad,My review does not matter because the company is gone. They went through bankruptcy like many other retailers in recent years. competition is tough in the market
bad,"Bonton was a typical retailer geared more towards an older crowd."
bad,BonTon has closed their doors after many years of struggling.  The main issue was BonTon did not keep up with the trends.  The clothes were made for the elderly.
bad,I worked at Bonton for two years and never received a raise or benefits or full time status.  The hours were very inconsistent and my expectations were high.
bad,"Not a good place to work. Managers were not helpful to their employees. I did like working with customers, and I enjoyed the customer experience. Bon-Ton has since went out of business."
bad,The company was not well kept. No wonder why it went under. The sales that associates are expected to get per day is very unrealistic. No one wanted to open a credit card because the interest was ridiculous.
bad,I was able to work from home.  The company has since filed bankruptcy and I was laid off.  I did not rate the company with a very high score because they are no longer in business.
bad,"The hardest part of the job was the realization of the bankruptcy."
bad,Bad management.. upper management is worse ...they lie and hover  employees ...worst place I've ever worked in my life..I advise you to look elsewhere for job ..they like lazy people and they protect lazy workers ..they have favorites
bad,Going out of business.  This company didn't do well and is being liquidated so there is no point in giving a review because the company essentially no longer exists
bad,The customers are really nice people.  They tell us how much they will miss the store now that it is closing and sympathize with associates becoming unemployed displaced workers.
bad,"Worked there about a year. That was my only goal to make it one full year to get the experience for future jobs. Just doing that was so very difficult. All the managers besides two of the five, would give you attitude on literally everything. You ask for help they huff and puff and cry a river because they actually had to get off their butts. Granted they worked their butts off when HR or district manager was there, but the second they left the managers all ganged up and you never seen them on the floor again. Pathetic. They judge you for all mistakes you make and don't teach you to fix it for future reference, instead they roll their eyes in disgust and fix it themselves and you stand there like you're nothing. They talked about all the employees and all the employees talked so much about each other. Absolutely no guidance, no motivation. What so ever. Wouldn't have stayed there a month if I didn't promise myself to gain a year experience. And to be honest it was worthless experience. I would not recommend working here to anyone. And don't even get me started on the coupons."
bad,Bankruptcy due to lack of Senior  management skills and overpaid senior management. Company is closing doors and leaving associates go without severance
bad,"This company no longer exists.  It was bought out.  It was okay."
bad,"If you're friends with upper management, then your experience is great. If you're not friends with them then that's a completely different story. The only way to get a raise is to threaten to quit, only then is the raise a few cents. Upper management does not respect hard working employees, they take advantage of them. If you're willing to work extra hours once they will continue to schedule you for more and more hours."
bad,I liked working there.Knew what had to been done.The hardest part of the job was when the truck was late they still want to get out at the same time.I would still be working there if the store was not closing.
bad,"Terrible benefits, terrible management, terrible pay, over worked, barely a break, if you get hurt at work you don’t get time off or paid time off. Worst job ever."
bad,"Bon Ton was by far the worst place I ever worked. The assistant manager needs to be fired, and the person in charge of HR needs to retire!"
bad,Ok company to start out a sales career. Good people and discount just be sure to move out of retail and into a more rewarding sales field.  Great for high-school of college students.
bad,"Was told by management that we would never be paid competitive wages as other warehouses, brought in temporary's and paid them more than their full time employees.  Had people using drugs inside the warehouse and did nothing about it, management treated employees with no respect"
bad,"Not a good place to work.  No effort to help with employees, Pay rate not enough for the hard work employees need to do.  Management is organized.  Warehouse is cold in the winter and very hot in summer."
bad,"Bonton is by far the most unorganized unprofessional place I have ever worked. The management is the worst. And there beyond rude. "
bad,"I have heard other locations aren't as bad as the one I am working at. However, the one I am at is absolutely a miserable place to work. Don't count on getting your schedule in time or them taking the days you need off into account. Also, don't count on staying in the department you were hired to work in. I work in cosmetics and they still try to get me to go help out in the other departments. I see people getting tossed around their first week on the floor.. handbags, jewelry, dresses, home goods. It doesn't matter. They don't train you on the floor, you get register training and your done. Managers stalk you, make up rules as they go and treat you like peasants. This is a horrible place to work. (Also they pay less than any other department store)"
bad,"they didn't give me my bonus for working the holiday, keep us way past time and couldn't have my phone just in case my babysitter needed something or if something happened to my child."
bad,the job is extremely slow and at time really tedious. worked here while in high school and I way there for over a year and never saw a raise which is unbelievable
bad,"the store manager and h.r manager is horrible, they will not support train or lead you in any way. Take advice and look somewhere else if you want a career or advancement or even job stability. "
bad,"My supervisors were very catty. The company does not value long term employees. Our office director told our office manager that I was ignorant. I have a southern accent, that's why she said I was ignorant. Of coarse, the office manager had to run and tell me. Very unprofessional."
bad,"Typical day at work was normal day, I learned how to open and close cash register, Scan customers, Straighten the racks, Scanning checks and payments on card. The hardest was learning how to use the cash register. I enjoyed working with my co workers."
bad,All I can say is that I have met some really great co workers who are just a dissatisfied as myself. Walking into a startup company they seemed to have a lot to offer but in the end has been nothing but lies. This company has been around for many years and I know that a lot of money has been made but they want you to go above and beyond and pay us so little that all you are working for is to pay bills. It's such a miserable place to work.
bad,"under payed for the amount of work asked to be done, no hours given, and doesn't give more even if asked. hard to schedule anything for upcoming weeks as to they do weekly schedules that are never out on time."
bad,Little to No training except a few video. Placed in low volume store and was expected to produce and decrease the shrink from external theft. which was 10% of the other stores.
bad,"If you want to never know how many hours you'll have to pay your bills, if you'll get any breaks, or who is going to yell at you next, then the Bon Ton is right for you! There aren't really any benefits for part time employees,and  they don't hire anyone full time. They continue to raise the expectations for sales and credit goals, while sales keep going down and there is less and less business. Management, aside from one person in HR from my experience, is completely unreasonable and not understanding at all of personal illness or hardship. Overall, you don't want to work here, so apply somewhere else."
bad,Everything about this company was bad except the people. The store sells expensive brand products but only pays employees $7.35 with a $0.10 annual raise. not to mention the schedule is demanding and so is the job. I have dont more work here than any other job and got paid less than any other job
bad,"Giving make-overs and explaining how our product can make a difference in their appearance.   Good Skin Care."
bad,Typical day involved routine dress room cleaning. Management didn't have a specific schedule of what needed to be done. I would often find things to do yet would be called to the register to just stand there. I don't like just standing around.
bad,Schedule interferes with school. Flexible hours but not convenient.
bad,"Fast pace. Lots to complete in a very short time. "
bad,"Co-workers were great, management not so great. Best part about job was working with the public."
bad,"The job was temporary, the pay was low, you need to dress up everyday . did not like being responsible for the money."
bad,"Only work there if starving to death is the only alternative. It was chaotic, and everything was always broken. There was too little oversight for new employees."
bad,"CLOSED due to bankruptcy. Not much more to say, good discounts, bad hours and it felt like they owned you in comparison to the time you had off. Time off in advance was bad."
bad,Company has the same problem as congress. They all know what the problems are but there are too many clowns in high places to mitigate/ratify the issues
bad,A supervisor thats running a store that lacks employees but pushing through the day and putting a smile on customers faces. I have learned that hard work does pay off.
bad,Company had a serious problem with lying! I even saw one of my coworkers to pay roll check bounced! The company lost a lot of money in advertising. Why
bad,"Depressing atmosphere. Grey walls, no daylight, gross old beat up carpet, etc. Some departments are so under staffed if you do not work OT there is no way you will get your work done. Management feels the pressure too but there is nothing they can do. Just have to figure it out and get it done. What I learned after working at Bonton: find a company that cares about their employees. Somewhere you are not just a number or a robot."
bad,"Working here is like slamming your head into a wall over and over again. The management changes constantly and if you finish the day and get to come back the next, that's a good day. The people in charge are inexperienced and refuse to listen to the employees that have the experience to help. Bonton has been in financial trouble for awhile and when they built the dc in WestJeff they just added to that. The building was constructed as cheaply as possible. Anywhere you work you can see nuts and bolts laying around and all you can do is hope they're extras and not just falling out of things. Upper management is starting to give people larger job classifications but not paying them more. Most of the people that work here are pretty nice, hardworking people that are just trying to keep their jobs but some do less because they are tired of getting treated badly. I would say 80% of the workforce here is looking for another job."
bad,"I worked in the early morning stocker/receiving department, the receiving manager was a great manager to work for, but the general manager is a people person, very rude, even coworkers were unhappy to work with too, apply at your own risk."
bad,"I worked there as their LP Supervisor for about 9 months. It was brutal. Pay was decent, but the expectations were impossible. Poor management that would always screw over their supervisors. The one thing I liked was the guy who worked under me. I understand loss prevention is all about results, but when the store is dead, not really much you can do with shoplifters. Not to mention, they change their LP Supervisors like underwear. So, in my opinion, find something else."
bad,Bon Ton just cared about getting product  out. Didn't care how over worked staff was. Didn't get full 30 minute lunch breaks. Micro management. Didn't ask employees for their opinions.
bad,"customers are rude and demanding, unreasonable demands from management, unreasonable sales goals for the hourly they pay you. they literally do not care about their employees at all. counted multiple “late warnings” from me for things that were entirely not my fault, IE schedule changing without notice, no way to check schedule from home."
bad,"They pay barely over minimum wage and pressure you to open store credit cards and get people's personal emails for their marketing campaigns. I worked in several of their locations and rude, over-bearing managers were a common denominator."
bad,"My experience at Bon-ton was short for numerous reasons, one being an excess number of coupons, that (excludes) basically everything in the store, then having to continuously explain why the coupons don't work. When the customer was upset about coupons or incorrect signs, you were supposed to give it to them, Another being the Reward Cards (credit cards), it was expected everytime you worked, you needed to open a Rewards card but the problem was either the customer already had one or didn't want one. They also called you constantly to come in and work. Didn't matter if you were at school or busy or working another job. Also, management rarely helped you especially when the customer wanted to speak to them or when you were by yourself with a line. The only thing good that came out of this job was the co-workers because they understood and actually made the stressful days less stressful."
bad,it is so slow that i think a layoff is on the way you have very high number to get you run all day to try to get them its hard on your feet every week they tell you 20 hours or less i thought this was fuu time
bad,"In this position I would assist customers with credit card payments, returns, sales transactions and locating merchandise on the sales floor."
bad,Management poor and work with you only when they want or need something from you. They constantly mess up payroll them when you tell them they don't fix it and they constantly cut hours
bad,PT - Very lack of pay & it’s biweekly & the hours were terrible not enough to even pay 2 bills .. constantly cutting hours .. it’s like if you weren’t even employed long story short ... does NOT help pay the bills at all & there’s no teamwork. Not worth it
bad,Work/life balance is not good. Not much room for advancement. Workplace culture is poor. They are trying to make the culture better but keep missing the mark.
bad,"We would start out with printing the internet orders, then we would have to find the items. we would either confirm if we had the item or not and go from there, if the item was there we could pack and ship the item(s). I learned a new software and a good bit of its kinks. the management did a good job at attempting to answer questions right away, if they didn't know they would either find out for you so they knew as well or they would point you in the direction to look for your answer. the coworkers were very easy to get along and work with. the hardest part of the job was on holidays it was a lot of paperwork and packages, it wasn't the workload it was finding the flow. the most enjoyable part was finding the items and sending them on their way. you had a chance to learn a lot of the stock and where it was and easy ways to find them."
bad,"good place to work when i started. great co-worker, good discounts, good schedule, meanest worst big boss i ever had. best department boss. good products and sales. was laid off when they could have easily moved me to another department"
bad,I worked as a sales associate in the Mankato mn store.  Awful experience. Store director two faced. Management does not care about their employees or their questions.  Don't even shop at that store anymore.  I would at a different town one.
bad,Gave me Experience in Customer service and learned how to deal with todays Customer's
bad,The employees were excellent and dedicated. very receptive and I was one to reward all my employees in the department. Management was poor and lacked communication.
bad,"If you don't open multiple credit cards per week you are publicly shamed and will be passed over for advancement.  The employees are all lovely, however and that is reason enough for many people to stay"
bad,Benton had been struggling for years. Very unstable work environment.  Very bad morale. Despite that I did enjoy my position and the duties it came with. Very fast paced and always changing.
bad,As Bon-Ton has filed bankruptcy there was a significant lack of ability to move forward or progress.  I believe the management team that was in place here really tried to turn everything around.  Unfortunately it was too little too late.
bad,"It was a friendly place to work but they had to many problems with trying to figure out the schedule. There was a point in time were I wasn't on schedule for two weeks, and other times were on schedule didn't match up with the main schedule. I typically helped customer and picked up the store. I loved helping the customers and I enjoyed the people I worked with."
bad,"The job itself was fun. I loved the customers and a few co-workers. However, manager was horrible, had no respect for employees and very judgmental. Bon-Ton could be a good place to work if they would get better Manager and Supervisors and hire more store associates to cover shifts."
bad,"I applied to this job because it was clerical, then the day after I started the person training me said it was fulfillment , which was not on the job listing, it just said cash office and still does when they list it. I have a leg disability and was just coming back to work after being very sick and I was upfront with this."
bad,"I worked there for four months, love customers, management and co-workers, not all but most were terrible to me, call for manager wouldn't answer phone, not enough employees to cover areas, not given breaks, they deliberately would not answer phone, when you needed a break, can see, what department is calling, when you needed assistance for customer, you get sighed at, clickish work environment, few very nice co-workers the rest nasty, mean and useless. I wouldn't advise anyone to work here!!!"
bad,I worked for this company for a few weeks. Awful experience. The management was awful and extremely unprofessional. Minimum wage. Clothes every where. I'd pick clothes up turn around and their back on the floor. The customers were never a problem but the mangers and other employees were awful. I had to teach myself how to do everything and never had any help
bad,Nothing good to say right now. Possible Liquidation 1000 or more people can possible loss there jobs. I love my job I love the people I work with but due to bad decisions for the higher ups we are in this predicament. Not only I am a hard worker but I am also loyal.
bad,"The job is super easy, Mangers are really cool. I really enjoy upper Management I followed them from my last job. If you work 10 hours a day you get 45 min lunch and 2 breaks. No CELL PHONES on the floor,"
bad,"Company went bankrupt due to inept upper management.  Otherwise it was a good place to work.  Pay was OK, benefits were good and there was a good balance between work life and family life.  It was a shame it closed."
bad,"Worked with a lot of great people above and below my job level. "
bad,Company liquidated following takeover bid by liquidation firm during chapter 11 bankruptcy auction process. Workplace culture deteriorated leading up to bankruptcy.
bad,"I have no comment about this company"
bad,The drama in the department was too much and the management was horrible.
bad,"The coupon policy is really awful. The customers complain if you dont let them  use their coupons. They swear and yell and throw fits. Then you let them use their coupons, youre an excellent employee but get accused of stealing because you changed the price for a person with a coupon when told it was okay to do so."
bad,Would have continued to be a great place to work had they managed the business correctly and not been forced to liquidate and lay everyone off. Fun face and paced environment until the end.
bad,"Management is beyond clueless, you might as well fend for yourself. Human Resources needs to retire. Literally will get a ten hour shift on a Saturday. Will never get the days you ask off. Both are forgetful. You're always being demanded to open charges and now they're doing the pettyiest thing and announcing it on the loud speakers that we have no credits open as if that's going to help anything. Sales are plummeting!! Everything is literally 50% off so if you're on a draw you're literally making nothing. Let's not forget the hourly wage, for a department store that's always bragging on how much it makes you get next to nothing. And absolutely no one gets fired unless you steal. So yes harrass all the coworkers you want because you will get away with it. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU, ONLY THESE CREDITS. Good luck though."
bad,Was not treated fairly compared to others. Management was not well balanced and had favorites. Managers sometime had contests for who could get the most credit accounts open.
bad,I only worked for them for a short period of time and all I can say is that it was definitely a learning experience. I was the hired to be in a training program which never really happen. I actually ended up running the entire men's floor. Which in the long run turned out great because I knew a lot about men's clothing for when I started at Brooks Brothers.
bad,"Poor management that’s why company failed, way to much inventory, they would over buy and never enough room on the floor to present it all neatly. Customers hated the coupons, to many restrictions."
bad,"This is a vary frustrating place of employment. Management acts like they care about their employees but fails to execute on this. Its more important for them to hit there many goals than it is about making sure their staff is properly trained, taken care of, happy. There was only 2 managers that truly cared out of 6(including GM)."
bad,I do not feel this was a place with good work ethices and bad Communication with employees as dell as Customer I Would not recommand this job to any one
bad,"They promise a good job, but never seem able to really offer any good reasons to stay at DC jobs. Lack strong management and never say Thank you for doing a good job."
bad,"daily routine work"
bad,They lie to cover each other they don’t fallow  policies communication between Managers is not good overall I was heartbroken when I left the company.
bad,Very busy work environment.  Ability to solving issues for customers.  Expectations  required by management for sales.  Workplace environment can be hectic and very fast paced.  Ability to Multi-task and direct other co-workers so time became efficient.  Training new staff I found to be enjoyable.
bad,unload truck stock clean stockrooms general maintence housekeeping painting moving fixtures around process stock to the floor load truck process damages
bad,"Management was ridiculous.  Sales pushes were not realistic, and also extremely invasive and intrusive to the customers. No benefits for hours that were less than certain amount.  The benefits they did* have were terrible and covered almost nothing."
bad,They state they meet your 401k but they haven't done that for the past two years.  Raises are next to nothing your lucky to get.10cents raise.  Not the place to go to for a retirement future.
bad,"Once you navigate through the countless policies, and their exceptions, you are confronted with more politics than Washington DC."
bad,The management took their personal affairs out on associates and there was no room for raises or improvement.
bad,"Learned many things on Marketing and administration, from the MD of the company. Each meeting with the MD was a fresh learnings for me."
bad,"As much as I loved what I did, the culture and the people changed which is why I left in the first place. Had the people not changed and things stayed relatively calm it might have been different. There were a lot of expectations that were unreasonable coming from management. Given that only 40 hours a week could be worked, some tasks could not be completed."
bad,the customers are awful and the management is lackluster. The time that I worked there I can ensure that the raises are not much and not often. The most i received was $0.18
bad,"If you like Fast Pace in busy work this would be a great job, but right now there is much uncertainty and job security and more time being laid off then working. Yearly raises are very very low and yearly evaluations are intentionally underscored for the purpose of giving out very low raises. Management and leads can be quite unprofessional and there seems to be no resolution going through human resources or 2 higher up management."
bad,This store closed down. However when I worked there some coworkers and management were very petty. I was not happy there however I did learn that I have a love for retail work.
bad,I was taken advantage of as an old employee. I was not treated well by management and the other associates. The job was easy but the people that worked there and management is why I quit. I saw no advancement in the job and pay was very poor with the work load I had. I give Bonton a two star overall rating.
bad,They hire ex-felons but only to seasonal jobs. The ethnicity is not diverse in the Fairborn Distribution Center in full time workers but it is for the seasonal worker.
bad,Worked my way up to receiving manager and hit a brick wall. At the time I was there Bon Ton eliminated all full time hourly positions and the store had 50% turn over.
bad,"This was my first time working for a small business. Good experience, i was able to learn how to assist in running a small company."
bad,"The job seemed good enough for minimum wage, but during my employment I found myself injured. My employer refused to allow me the accommodations my doctor prescribed me, and I ended up needing surgery to fix the problem. I was then fired because management deemed me ""not important enough to the company"" to be worth saving my job until my recovery. "
bad,it is a one sided story when it comes to working here.  Management is always right even if they are wrong.  They say they have an open door policy but I think its open just so that they can slam it in your face.
bad,"The only good thing that came out of working here is I met my husband.  The place is poorly managed with constant mandatory overtime that they swing on you sometime during the day.  I am a mother and this is very difficult when they change my schedule during the day.  The team leaders are wonderful and for the most part very supportive, however, the rest of the management is difficult to get a long with."
bad,Retail is not a particularly pleasant environment.  The work is unsatisfactory and mindless.  There is NO appreciation at all from management and the pay is very poor with little to no opportunity for advancement.  You are on your feet for hours and hours.
bad,The head manager seemed to be completely disconnected from the real issues of the store. If she spent less time gossiping about other employees and managers then maybe the store would be more successful. Customer traffic is usually slow which makes for a lot of down time. There is not a lot to do around a store with no customers. The scheduling was very inconsistent. I would be scheduled every night of the week and then twice the next week. It's hard to plan things around such a random schedule. This job gave me more motivation to go out and find a new job.
bad,I was given three departments and expected to work 12+ hour days in heals. The management team was not very supportive because they were overwhelmed in their own work. Sometimes we were told that we needed to get our work done before we could take a quick lunch. I would often find the store manager crying in her office. The pay was salary but required too many hours that didn't justify it. I was happy to leave my position and find something better
bad,I have worked at herbergers for 2 years and it is honestly the worst place i have ever could have chosen to work. They give you terrible hours and they are very rude around you. If you put you cannot work because of something such as church they change your availability and refuse to give it to you. If you are n school and have school activities and they schedule you on a activity day they have to give it off to you and when i was in this situation my manager yelled at me for being uncompetent and not coming to them sooner and that it was my fault that she was going to ave to cover for me. The hardest part of the job id dealing with the terrible management staff. I have had to miss so many school and family activities because my managers refuse to give it off to me. They are the worst people you could ever work with. The most enjoyable part is talking eitht the customers.
bad,"Doesn't really have much room for advancement, the benefits were ok as long as you were full time, the pay increase took forever. I was there 7 years and my pay went from 7.30 to 10.55 the only way my pay increased was i went from part time to full time then to selling supervisor which took 7 years."
bad,"In my position, i am given the brunt of the work with minimal pay and almost no room for advancement. Functions for day to day processes are extremely out dated and upper level does not listen to suggestions for adjustments to better systems or routine."
bad,very fast paced online department store DC. Good management - peak seasons are stressful. only 3 years since start up. needs more experienced online management
bad,it was a part time position that held little advancement opportunity.
bad,Slow traffic but very nice clientel.  Management did not know anything for this dept.  Just a part time job.
bad,Coworkers were not always friendly or helpful; lack of work-ethic of fellow coworkers made job unnecessarily challenging
bad,"A typical retail environment, with rotating schedules including nights and weekends and holidays."
bad,Overworked toward the end due to massive lay offs in the HR department. It was a great working environment in the beginning before the lay offs. The discounts were great.
bad,Co-workers were nice and friendly. No room to grow. Some of the customers were full of themselves and you were just suppose to let them just act like that.
bad,"Managers did not care to be flexible accordingly. Between school hours and family emergencies, they were not  accommodating whatsoever. Also, with every ad that went out, it was always intense and competitive with other employees. Very unsanitary and poorly taken care of, clothes all over the floor left for the last person working to try and fix before it was closing time. Working there I found alcohol beverages and cigarettes in dressing rooms, etc. would not recommend working at a Bon-Ton unless good words were mentioned."
bad,"This company when through financial issues. "
bad,"While working here, I made many friends. Unfortunately, the hours were never consistent and many times I was unable to attend my children's activities. There were no benefits for part time employees and the pay was not good."
bad,The company did not invest in developing its talent in the stores.  They always looked for the least expensive way to support the stores rather than the most productive or what would serve both the associates and customers best.
bad,"The company is in bankruptcy and was purchased by a liquidation company. although the region I worked in was profitable, there are other stores that were not."
bad,Management         wanted        apprehensions        every      day     Management    staff  lack  professionalism    Management staff  un.    trustworthy pay sucks    five cents every year
bad,"Was drained on a daily basis from the environment.  Most of management was ok to work for but a few didn't do anything, expected everyone else to help them with their tasks, and talked behind everyone's backs. Negative, negative, negative."
bad,"The people themselves were great but policy sucked. We didn't help the customers much,  managers weren't able to help the customer or really assist you till after the call was over. They rarely almost never checked with fed-ex top actually check on a missing package so customer a lot of times were just screwed out their money."
bad,"Miserable place to spend your day.  Slow-paced so you can't make any money.  Some managers were great although overworked (again, only some).  Not a fun place to be."
bad,typical day is busy because it is understaffed and busy with customers. Its hard to keep the store presentable and shop able because there isn't enough employees
bad,The company was new and very unorganized. There were a lot of people that tried to play boss and things would get confusing. I was told would eventually be full time but never did
bad,there is a lack of communication going up and no one wants to make decisions in middle management in fear of mistakes. As a result their has been a number of problems building up over the years. Overall the work place is relaxed with people taking breaks (smoke and meals) as they like but it isn't regulated fairly. The pay is lower than average for some positions and one can feel overworked or underworked depending on the weekly schedule
bad,"its a very nice place to work for a second job, or a student in school. its not a retiring job so the pay is not all good. I'd recommend it for teens."
bad,"At the time I worked there, the juniors department had great/trendy clothes which I loved and shopped there all the time. The employees that I worked with were considered friends and I still keep in touch with a couple of them 12 years later."
bad,"This company is plagued by poor upper management decisions, low pay, and less-than-ideal lower level employees. There are problems with attendance and poor productivity."
bad,"Piece rate was set at 600 per hour, which left little room for error. Plenty of product got damaged in movement by other workers claiming to make their goals. Expected to move a half pound box at the same rate as a 70lb box. Sometimes was able to move product with forklift, but was mostly hand moved."
bad,I worked in the Washington store. Store #37 it was a nice place. I was able to keep myself busy and enjoyed everything. But trust me managers not the supervisors but managers will screw you over. They will also throw you into whatever dept they want. I didn't mind that but still. Be very careful what you do and be very observant to your job.
bad,"Product focused, exciting atmosphere, but unorganized environment."
bad,Same as Above- Planning atmosphere more structured and organized.  Fabulous staff and management in planning.
bad,The review summary is good enough. Nothing more to elaborate.
bad,"I'm only a seasonal worker but my time at Bon-Ton was horrible. One manager says one thing and then the other tells you to do another. I went one whole month ( November) without a check because they didn't have my ""associates number"" ready in time. I was supposed to get paid Friday January 10, 2014 and i have yet to receive that check. you give them the days you cant work and they schedule you for those days anyways. They don't care if it interferes with your personal life. I would not reccomand this a place to work."
bad,I worked in logistic I systematized manual operation to accurately distribute incoming product.
bad,"A typical day at work involved personnel management, inventory control, facilities management, and customer service all on top of receiving management duties, all for two locations. The company cut corners on personnel at all possible avenues. The receiving manager was responsible for changing the 500 light bulbs in the store, for example. I was also given 40% of the prior years man-hours to complete the same amount of work with a team of the same size. When performance faltered, I was faulted for it, despite individual productivity being up by the companies own performance metrics."
bad,"Th pay and work environment and requirements are a great fit for a high school student, but it is not adequate for an adult trying to make a living."
bad,Typical retail job. Left there in order to continue tutoring at college.
bad,"Very stressful especially towards the closing of the store"
bad,Company was unorganized and poor management.  Poor communication and high turnover of employees.  Not enough pay for the amount of work expected out of employees.
bad,I worked alone in a women's department and put to be in charge of opening and closing three registers by myself with 1 and a half days of training. It was stressful and tiring.
bad,"My last two years at Bon-Ton were had some good things going - I finally had a good manager and pyramid head that fought for our department and they encouraged us to explore and execute on new ideas. I generally enjoyed my position however, that wasn't enough. The company was on the way to bankruptcy, had went through numerous layoffs and restructures with the workload increasing every time. There wasn't training and monetary incentives were slim. The work culture was non-existent - no team-building outings and only a daytime holiday party. It was pretty clear there was no budget to pay employees properly."
bad,"Bon-Ton was fast paced and equipment was defective half of the time. because of the poor tools used to process cartons, it was difficult to make rate. the standards were very tough to accomplish. most of the co-workers were decent people"
bad,Poor senior manager leadership with a lack of focus and direction.  Inability to drive top line sales has resulted in ever increasing pressure on expense reductions.  No work/personal life balance with no signs of improving.
bad,Management constantly on the docks wanting to know why the boxes wouldnt run when the equipment would break down
bad,"Unfortunately, BonTon is one of those companies that just wants you to work and work and never say anything. If you're a person ready for rigorous work then you may fit but if physical jobs are not for you then you will hate this place. You're on your feet the entire shift doing various tasks within the warehouse. Nobody likes upper management so you'll find that middle management runs the show when the bosses are off in their offices. The company wants you to value them and never leave without a two weeks notice(said in orientation) but they will terminate you quicker than raid on a bug. They don't drug test because i'm sure they can't find clean people to actually slave here. You get a small production bonus but don't go working super hard because you will be disappointed. One good thing I can say is the people around you will make the job somewhat enjoyable. They do try to incorporate some fun things in at lunch time on fridays throughout the month, but in my mind it was only to keep us appeased before we went back into the warehouse to break out backs for little pay."
bad,Compensation wasn't the best but the other employees were amazing. Could be a fun and challenging place to work. It was fun while it lasted but unfortunately the company is closed.
bad,I often had to be pulled aside from whatever I was doing at the moment to be put on another project because of the lack of employees.  The manager did not complete the paperwork needed to officially put me on their payroll until 2-3 weeks after I worked my first shift.
bad,"niente di particolare di cui lamentarsi, contratti a parte."
bad,Only applies to Cedar Falls location. Job is very enjoyable in and of itself but the employee morale is very low. Management is extremely poor and inexperienced.
bad,"Enjoyed my Cosmetics management Position for Clinique Cosmetics,as well as the other positions i worked at the store."
bad,"I left Younkers in my town because of the new HR manager. I had worked there for two months, and when I showed my HR Manager my college schedule for my first term, she comes up to me two days after and tells me WHILE I'M WORKING I'm being let go in two weeks because my college schedule doesn't work for Younkers."
bad,"work you and get rid of you. wasn't what I was expecting at all, I felt used."
bad,During the holiday shopping season this is a great place to work. If you want lost of overtime. There is plenty of money to be made.  But during the holiday season it is 7 days a week mandatory 8 to 10 hours A-day. So if you're not into overtime don't work there during the holiday season. But in the 9 holiday season it is hard to get your 40 hours. Everyday there's not enough orders to pick for everyone that works there. And on average you get 5 to 6 hours A-day if you're lucky.
bad,"I have been spoken to about someone that I spoke with and that person twisted or eliminated things that I said.  I feel that I am under a microscope and others want me to be fired for things that I never said.  others stand around and do nothing and others do not do what is required of them.  I am tired working in a place that does this.  I need to move on to a more mature atmosphere, otherwise things are fine and managers are ok."
bad,Typical Day for me was data analysis and projections.  Working with Senior mangagement was a regular task.  Hardest part of the job was accuracy.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the friendliness of the co-workers.
bad,Management...Best part all the benefits...employee discount.
bad,Working at Bon Ton was a new experience.  I interacted with all the departments and worked with a god team.  This was my first fulltime job which taughtme a lot of responsibility.
bad,I learned how to quickly and efficiently put away deliveries of products ranging from clothing to shoes and furniture. I also learned several organizational habits as well
bad,The review of this company is truly of no importance as the company no longer exists. Company went through ch11 bankruptcy and the courts decided liquidation as our fate.
bad,"I currently work at Bergner's, which is a store apart of the Bon Ton franchise. The job is not good. It may be better in other stores, but at mine it has not been a good experience. "
bad,"There was a lack of communication within the company and the store.  There was also inconsistency in dealing with policy violations, etc. from one employee to another."
bad,"I did learn some valuable skills such as time management, however the culture didn't feel too welcoming. Employees had a difficult time communicating, and each manager had their own agenda. This made it hard to do any significant progress."
bad,I really do not have any opinion about Bon-Ton the the current moment. I think the company may be going out of business. They filed for bankruptcy but are failing to share all the info with their employees.
bad,I will not say anything wrong they gave me a chance to work and thAt all you can ask for once you get that what more do you want I thank the company for my chance
bad,Pay does not match the amount of work you are expected to complete. Also a good ole boys/girls club environment. Only a handful of people with a willingness to work.
bad,"good place to start your career. high stress, fast pace, good benefits events and sale all the time. very high turnover, need structure"
bad,"I did not enjoy working for Bon Ton, it was very high stress, a lot of work and stress put on the cashiers."
bad,"I enjoyed working retail, especially at the Bon-ton. It was pretty laid back because the mall that it's in is usually quite dead. For the most part everyone was pretty friendly. But unfortunately the management was not so friendly."
bad,For the reason I rated it a 2 star I would rather not discuss the review I had with working at the Bon-Ton.
bad,"Poor upper management, schedule never out on time, low wages, employees not promoted within."
bad,"The employees are very friendly and welcoming. The work itself is decent and at times can be very rewarding. The majority of the managers are friendly and helpful. However, they can also act very unprofessionally towards the employees. At times they allow personal issues affect their work as well as the way they treat both the employees and the customers. There is also a miscommunication, at least it has been stated, between the store and corporate. The store is to overhire for the departments but are to cut back on hours. They promise the employee upon first hire that they will receive at least 20 hours per week but in reality because of the amount of employees per department the average hours per week is around 8. If it weren't for the lack of hours and unprofessional management this store would be a great place to work and I would surely be working there still."
good,"find your match, you will be good when it comes to getting along with managers."
good,Typical retail environment - stressful especially around holidays when you are required to work until closing the day before a holiday and then open up first thing the day after.
good,I tried my best there but I cannot and will not work for peanuts I like my co workers and that’s it.. but you be the judge don’t take my word for it to each it’s own
good,"Terrible place to work, only give at most 10 cent raise a year. Expect too much work from employees, like vacuuming floors when customers need help. Hired a person who worked in retail for the same duration as me and she started at a dollar more. Bon-Ton does not care about their employees at all. Will also only get scheduled to work not even four hours for a whole week and management doesn't care."
good,"My day started off good in the morning but by 12:00 noon it was hectic and I often worked alone in my department because of lack of help. The benefits (health insurance) was not that gret and the deductible was high. "
good,"typical day includes cashing, putting clothes away, and other tasks. management was not great."
good,Human resources works with my schedule as I work another job. However they understaff which causes the associates to have to work under stressful situatations.
good,I did so mach in my department and the managers were never supportive. I cried so much leaving there and all they wanted us to do was open credit charges.
good,"I worked as a sales associate and the job started off good, nice managers and co-workers. However, as people left and got replaced, the whole environment of the store turned negative. Some managers were very unprofessional at times, employees are unprofessional and behaved petty. The whole store is an unorganized mess. There is insufficient training. The main manager would hire just whoever not actually caring if that individual was adequate for the job. You are not treated fairly and do not get paid enough for the amount of work."
good,Productivity requirements at $8hr !!!  Yelled at by managers without being.told beforehand of expectations.  HR nice. Overworked for the pay. Managers unapproachable and unfriendly.
good,"company was great until new  management took over, would cut full time employees hrs to pay temps, only felt appreciated during holiday season"
good,"It was very exciting working at BonTon in the beginning and I loved it.  As the years went by they began cutting hours and I couldn't stay there with hardly any hours. I loved helping customers,that was my favorite part of my job. I learned alot of different things and I'm happy for that."
good,This retail store was very disorganized from a managerial stand point and it carried over into the staff.  Loved my co-workers.  Compensation and benefits were almost non-existent.
good,working the the public was lots of fun working as a cashier and sales
good,"Well overall the company wasn’t performing well financially. Each day was different, company was very indecisive about new processes. Other employees were helpful and trained was great. She was later promoted. The company was very risk adverse. Enjoyed the potlucks and food days."
good,"Did not like having to push charge cards onto customers."
good,"company went out of business on August 31, 2018.  I cannot  comment on them at this point in time. The liquidation was too long and created an unusual atmosphere."
good,"Company had good benefits, and I enjoyed the people that I worked with.  Buyers were expected to work unreasonable hours, and work/life balance for salaried people was bad.  Hourly people had pretty flexible schedules."
good,Bon-Ton is a fast past retail store that is not my first recommendation to a friends. If you would have asked me a year ago if you wanted to work there I would have said yeah sure if you some money the management was okay and the workers and people were great but recently new management has made it a challenge to be able to do my job. There are so many take they give you and the supervisors mean well but seem to be moving that they can’t be around to help an associate or work with them on a one to one basis. The hours are working as much as possible and there are no vocation days unless your full-time. Holidays you HAVE to work which is a bummer and if you are older than 18  then you will be there till 10-11:30 at night which sucks since they extended the hours they’re open and when associates are allowed to leave with the exception of the shoe and jewelry department.
good,"Since I’ve worked at bon-ton, you are not allowed to use your 20% employee discount with a debit card/credit card. Paid minimum wage is not enough (9.70) Especially when fast food workers in my state get paid $10.75. The systems in the computer are outdated and coupons are a huge complaint from customers. Work could be a fun environment if you work with the right people. My managers are very very uptight and get mad even when you go to the bathroom (even when having someone to cover your department) they do not give you freedom or trust you except their favorite employees. Company is short staffed and schedules too few people. My store opened last year at 6pm on thanksgiving so people could actually have dinner with their families, this year we open at 11 and it’s a mandatory 12 hr work day so you cannot schedule off on special sale days and holidays."
good,"Having to be connected 24-7 to your email is more than any associate should have to do. We are expected to be on the selling floor a minimum of 7 hours of our day, yet the emails and office work required cannot be done in less that 4 hour per day.  This makes for a very long work week,"
good,A typical day would include walking to customers seeing if they need help and cashing them out. paying their bill (credit/store card bill). putting out and marking new stock. I learned retail experience. cash handling experience.
good,"When BonTon purchased Carson's a few years ago, many employees thought they bit off more than they could chew, and it still looks like it sometimes. The biggest elephant in the room that often gets ignored is the complaints that come from customers 1.the coupons are too confusing and have too many exclusions 2. some of the signing is mis-leading 3. there is never enough help."
good,"At my store, people were not properly trained. I was put out on the floor to shadow an older worker but he was not clear of what to do. I would show up, not being told which station I was assigned to until I got there and had to bother a manager to tell me since it was never clear. The store was in shambles all the time, whether it was not having reshop done or merchandise being stolen, our store seldom looked presentable to customers. Eventually the store was closed well after I left due to the hours cutting into school and school work and I was unable to balance the two and was not receiving help from management"
good,Going out of business last months of business. Bad choices poor magement and bad business dealings  cause the company to fold. To much dets and not paying attention to detail and there bills. The co-workers are fun and the  only good thing about working there.
good,"This review is mute, as the company as gone bankrupt.  Retail can be a stressful environment, but my coworkers made my experience at Bon-Ton a pleasant memory."
good,"I was hired by Bon Ton a year ago and am sad to say the current retail atmosphere has finally taken it's toll on us.   On-line sales have basically replaced the ""department store"" model and lack of sales along with high prices created the decision by upper management to closed down several of our stores this year.  I truly did enjoy my job and most of the employees that worked there.   The demographic of people who shopped at our store was mostly the adult, middle-age to older clients who wanted a nicer cut of clothing with some style as well as taking advantage of our many sales and discounts that were available each week.   We were located in a dying mall which will be gone within the next two years as we were a substantial anchor store for them and many other shops have left,  as well as the mall having no real food court any longer - just a pizza place and a small bakery type shop left.   It is a sad but inevitable ending which we all saw coming."
good,Never back you up and don't care if you drive a distance only scheduled you 4 hour shifts the other employees are nice and caring . Managers only look out for themselves
good,"Company is highly reactive, rather than proactive.  Focuses are constantly shifting, and management is being constantly expected to pick up the hours that are being cut from hourly payroll.  "
good,"Our store did not have a single male supervisor, suggestions were ignored, input was shunned, and young attractive person's like myself were underutilized if not outright exploited with no hope of any monetary or career advancement. Serious written business proposals were ignored. They were unusually hostile toward guys and there was no real rational explanation to it, Never have I felt discriminated against as a guy, a gender not normally lumped as a minority and honestly I don't use those terms seeing them to be divisive and lame. But in full sobriety, there was this hostile take over where the younger men were cut in hours to the point of inducing all of their joint resignations. Their stock has dropped locally, they lied about the closing of stores in our radius to customers and they harbored and attitude of elitism as if they were pulling margins of AMAZON. It was a dead end in all directions."
good,"New warehouse but all the petty bickering and politics."
good,"This store expects you to jump in and know everything without training. They don't want to spend time showing you how to do something properly. It takes more than 5 minutes for a manager to help you when you call one.  If you need to request a day off you have to put in the request a month in advance. Overall, not a good place to work."
good,working here for almost 3 years i can say i didn't see a lot change in my time. some employees came and went but the store itself still was run down and ragged with no sight of it ever being fixed. the management never even thought to consider fixing or remodeling it.
good,"A typical day working at Bon-Ton was just like working at any other department store. I worked with helping out the customers, and putting new stock out and/or putting away clothing from the fitting rooms/tidying up the sales floor. One thing i definitely learned from this job is that, the customer is ALWAYS right, no matter what. The higher up management was never really around, esp. when needed, very unprofessional. The workplace culture had its drama, but if you stayed out of it and kept your opinions to yourself then you were fine. I would say the hardest part about this job was having to deal with those really rude customers about an issue that you (the associate) had no control over. The most enjoyable part about this job was that this was a really fun first job, and it taught me a lot."
good,This is a medium to fast paced mid level retailer that provides a wonderful learning experience for someone who seeks experience in retail management.
good,Lot of standing around without any work to do. Management does not know how to run a company.Managers and Leads stand around looking at you like you are stupid most of the time
good,"Too much drama,pettiness, hard to go to work place."
good,"Although the staff there is very friendly and engaging, the management there is something to be desired.  The supervisors are not given the ability to perform their jobs, and the leaders are lacking in knowledge of business and management."
good,"unreasonable expectations, terrible management, pay is not so great. all kinds of weird people."
good,"I would come into my shift ( day or night) and assess my numbers from the previous day and calculate my daily goal as that. If we were in our gift with purchase event I would make sure to include the previous days makeup or stretch goal numbers into todays number. I have learned to work at a fast pace, to apply makeup beautifully and correctly. My counter manager has been there for 7 years and not going anywhere. I am looking for room for growth. I am stuck in a part time not going anywhere position. The hardest part of my job is the stress on charge card accounts and numbers (a.k.a dollars). My favorite part about my job is making women/men feel good about themselves inside and out."
good,Present management proved to be unaccommodating and unprofessional. Management when i began there was very easy to work with. There were many lay-offs and the employees were left with the present management.
good,Short sighted leaders and a failure to adapt to retail trends were large contributing factors to the shut down of Bonton. High performing stores were rarely recognized for their performance while company did not do what was required to stay relevant among competitors.
good,"Bon-Ton has/had many store names. I worked for Herbergers located in Rapid City, SD. The work was easy, the pace was depending on the day. Regardless I learned something new about my duties every other day. My fellow associates were very friendly, it felt like a family. New people were always easily welcomed. The managers were nice."
good,Our store was very nice. Was part of the Carsons / Bergners group. Too much debt and not enough action to close non producing stores let to its downfall.
good,"Providing Customer service itself was very rewarding.  BonTon is out of business now due to mis-management from top to bottom.  Customers were treated poorly during so-called sales, online orders, returns, cheap products.  "
good,"the hardest part of the job was management. the best part of the job was some of the people i worked with."
good,The mornings started with a morning huddle and letting us know what  needed to be done and what sales and coupons that were on going. Management were helpful when you could find one. The co workers sometimes helped but not enough to make a difference in your department. After working there 6 months I was overlooked and someone was promoted above me when they were hired for holiday work and did not even work their 2 months. They do not promote from within and they lie if they say they do.
good,"Great company to work for 5 years ago. Deterioration was apparant as profit steadily decreased year by year. Employees overworked, understaffed. Last year was BRUTAL. Skeleton crews multitasked to point of ridiculous. Lost merchandising teams and markdown teams towards the ends. One fulltimer per depts if we cared at all about our depts did freight, markdowns, sale set, and had to watch till on any and every given day. Great team members who became our family. Management harried by corporate frantic demands,forced to cut our hours,deny requests for fulltimers steady and needed hours while piling on credit and customer service demands. VERY STRESSFUL IF YOU TOOK PRIDE IN YOUR DEPT(S).AND YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE. Felt pushed to the limits if you wanted to uphold standards you took pride in to the point of exhaustion,"
good,Fine place to work. Pay isn't great but it's a relaxed environment. Really no advancement opportunities unless you are there for years. Hours could have been better
good,Mi sono trovato bene con la maggior parte delle persone
good,I learned how important sales was in retail. There was a fair amount of competition for sales and people hogged the cashier register because the more you used it the more credit you received.
good,"A typical day was open up cash register in the morning, look over goals for the day, unload new merchandise in boxes, assist customers, and inventory."
good,They offer a good discount for their employees.  pay is not good at all for the amount of work you need to do each shift.  Short- Staffed except around holidays.  Very hard to find break coverage when you are supposed to take your break.
good,A typical day was fast paced and hands on all the time. Keeping up with order demands assuring all orders are completed in a timely manner and the receiving of new merchandise is received and put away to be available to sell was on going .I learned to predict sales and to schedule associates as needed on a daily basis. Keeping track of 160 associates between two shifts was a challenge but to know each associate and react to needs was fulfilling to me.
good,"Operation of sales register , Using working  knowledge to find items on ""Let US Find It "". Greeting customers with a friendly personality. Filling in product to the working floor"
good,"a typical day at work is not bad at all, consist of helping the customer find what they are looking for size color etc. straightening the department up. putting stock out. either opening or closing registers. i have learned to have patience for my elders, learned the new order management . also running cash register,place new charge accounts,make payments. the management is very respectful and thankful for the hard work we do for the store. my co workers are like one big happy family we all work together are there for one another. the hardest part of the job is not getting paid enough. the most enjoyable is my coworkers and the customers you learn to know their names. im a people person"
good,"A new speciality department that was brought to the store,previously was a leased area. A ongoing learning position that was self taught online to acquire knowledge to sell the products. A client list was kept as to the customers who bought, and clients who wished to be notified when a sales event was upcoming.Hired,train,review a friendly sales staff.A daily sales quota was logged to reach goals.This area was a counter within a department store,all areas of management was the Fine Jewelry managers responsibility. A high level of loss prevention, including showcase counts,a piece at one time to be brought out,diamond testing,and receiving merchandise.A great job to meet,have customers return and be happy with their purchases."
good,"nice place to work if you need work for a few months, no real advancement, also no job security."
good,"I enjoyed my time working there. They pretended all was well and store would remain open, however they lied and business went belly up. The entire chain closed up."
good,"A great group of people to work with - however, the company filed for bankruptcy and is in liquidation.  Very sad to see so many years of great customer service disappear for good."
good,It was a fine place to work and I enjoyed my time there.  The culture was laid back and there were many lovely people to work along side. It was a creative and fun environment.
good,"They were late to the table with ecom, was their demise. Took to long to get merchandise up on the site....did not have enough man power behind the web. Beyond sad."
good,Not well managed by upper management. Made poor choices.
good,"It was a good place to.work but they are closing."
good,"Learned a lot about fashion wear in the store."
good,"The first two years I enjoyed working for this company, friendly staff, learned a lot of great skills, such as managing my time better, setting up the sale, P.o.s operating experience, and over all making sure customers have great service. The lower level management was good, but there was a lack of communication. The upper management caused a lot of unnecessary stress on their associates when it came to opening charges, by using negative tactics against their employees."
good,"I enjoyed working with this company. Although, coming into the job, i knew it was a temporary placement for me, as i live a very unsettled lifestyle which requires me to regularly move from city to city. Coworkers and management are pleasant to work with. My only criticism would be the lack of training i recieved, and having to constantly explain to customers why their coupons never seem to work on most of their purchases. Strictly speaking for myself here when i add that having to almost be pressuring to customers at times in order to reach my daily sales goals was something that made me uncomfortable,  and so it was not something i wanted any part in. Guess i'm not cutout for sales lol. :^)"
good,"things are unorganized, hiring more people and giving regular employees less hours. did not like working on holidays, I liked driving forklift but was taken away with no explanation."
good,working at the bon-ton has taught me what good management is and what bad management is. some of the managers are very kind with the associates and there are other managers who are constantly rude to associates but hide it behind a smile. at the Bon-ton they don't respect the associates avaibility and they don't schedule enough people to work leaving one person to work alone in one department for several hours.
good,"I was disappointed in management and wished I was paid more. I liked it as my starter job though."
good,"This company has great potential to be a great competitor with other large retailers, but is just not taking the proper steps to advance. Job descriptions don't match job duties and the structure makes it impossible to move up within the company. Low-ball pay for most jobs because of how poor the company is doing as a whole."
good,"Established business with moderate employment and management. A typical day at work is orchestrated and planned out. Ive learned steps in merchandising and retail."
good,"Now called Carson's..."
good,This company made working there very hard because your raise depends on how much you sell for the company and that put a lot of pressure on everyone .
good,Most of people that I worked with were fantastic and will miss them!  Our jobs were out sourced to a company that employs customer service reps to work from home. We were told they do not hire people that live in Ohio.
good,It is just a job. My co-workers are nice. Unloading trucks is taking a toll. The people are nice to talk to.
good,"I joined the Bon Ton/Elder Beerman team in October as ""seasonal"" help for the Thanksgiving/Christmas holiday.  The associates in my department were awesome at training me!  All were helpful and a pleasure to work with.  The scheduling manager was also wonderful in  scheduling me to work around my school classes.  The worst part of the job is typical of retail type employment---standing on your feet all day, long hours and a terrible hourly wage ($7.85 per hour)."
good,it was fun to work there but not very busy to many stylist there
good,"A typical day there was getting the stock in, having to hang it and then getting to make the tags for the clothing. Some of my co-workers had different of doing their jobs. The most enjoyable part of it was that I was able to make the tickets up for the clothing and then making sure that the clothing got to the correct stores."
good,Every aspect of this environment is enjoyable but the fact there is not enough work to keep you busy.
good,"I really enjoyed working here, sadly I couldn't stay and had to quit because I had no where to stay during the weekend/holiday."
good,The pay rate is low for all the work you have to do. you put your life in danger everyday when you go to make an arrest. the job security is bad the company has closed down.
good,Working here was a good opportunity to learn something new. Alot of great people and management. Very understanding with life issues. They tried to give you the time off for important life matters.
good,I enjoyed working at this Distribution center warehouse position and really enjoyed working with my supervisor and the fellow employees. Enjoyed the job itself
good,"Company was liquidated and no longer in business"
good,Was a great place to work for the last 18 years.  Sad to see the company close.  Hopefully we were able to serve our communities and be remembered as a good department store that had good customer service
good,Everyday at Bon Ton brings new challenges. You never do the same thing. I've had many great bosses and worked with wonderful people. Upper management is top heavy and has no idea what's going on - always in panic mode.
good,"the store was in terrible shape,and Bonton had no plans to remodel.         low inventory.always under stocked.i worked on commision and if a customer bring back a purchase that i sold. the commision would be taken from me."
good,"It was a good job paid well, but the management sucked and they don't train you enough , so in the first day your clueless also the people there aren't to helpful. But overall its okay for what it is ."
good,"The company is going bankrupt and they hired WELL OVER their quota for seasonal employees, than turned around a complained that they didn't have enough coverage in certain departments. They let go good, hard-working people because they couldn't afford to keep everybody they hired."
good,"The job is easy to follow and most of the time you are kept busy. however for those with more time on their hands tend to lead to trouble with constant talking in groups of three or more. They pay you a decent amount to start with but when asked to do more than what your job description emply, you don't see much appreciation nor do you get the benefit of getting paid more for the extra you do such as train new hires or help management manage their department."
good,"nice place to work, the merchandise was decent , too much pressure on getting credit cards which was a constant problem. senior people were expected to set sale and get sales and get credit apps.  in a 4 hour shift., it took 6 hours to set the sale. As a result, if we spent time setting sale, we could not sell anything or get credit apps."
good,I learned a lot about the retail.  I had a wonderful supervisor that provided wonderful guidance.  I truly enjoyed working with my co-workers in my department.  I also truly appreciated the variety of responsibilities.
good,there is lots of favortism. The hours are great if you are looking for a nince to five job. However there is no possibiliy to move up o make more money.
good,"Overall the staff is very friendly and typically willing to work with you when it comes to certain scheduling. but dont count on it. there is alot of ""black out"" dates, which means you cant schedule off any of those set days for vacation or personal days. so your limited to certain months and time frames."
good,"I have a better customer service approach, we have great team work, the managers are freely and hard working. They can do better in how they treat their empoyees"
good,Upper management fails to communicate well with employees
good,Productive and very busy dealing with all internal and external customers.  This was a complete career change for me and worked my way up through the ranks to my current position.  The hardest part of the job is lack of clear communications.  The most enjoyable for me is the negotiating with the vendors and finding alternative creative solutions.
good,Belk was a job that I held throughout the last years of my college and it allowed me to become better dressed for success. Within my time at Belk I was allowed to be one of the lead's for bringing a new clothing line to the Huntsville area. Belk has been one of the jobs that helped to develop my customer skills.
good,"The best part about working for Bon Ton, is that we really want to make our customers happy. We go above and beyond to find what a customer wants, no matter what. "
good,"The store is internally disorganized. The company is overly obsessed with store credit cards to the point where I have irritated customers by being obligated to continue pushing them. "
good,Typical retail work environment with mounting pressure due to current economic conditions
good,"busy, many challenges; time management important; culture very mixed. managers were at odds with one another. great pay and ability to travel. Great sample sales. management did not follow board of directors direction. Only worried about how much money we could collect from vendors, not if it was the right product for the stores. Overall loved the actual job; the pay and team members."
good,"When I worked for Bon-Ton it was a good company to work and advance with.  But in the last several years the sales went down and nothing seemed to work to reverse this trend.  "
good,Extremely poor management communication but the job itself gave valuable skills. It was frustrating because it felt that everyone was doing the same work over eachother.
good,"No longer an option but this was a great place to work and gain experience over the years.  The learning environment was positive, the benefits just okay."
good,"Heavy on DVP's, very little staff to handle workload, upper management made decisions that put the company in a situation where the customer service is extremely poor and the store product is no selling."
good,The Management didn't have very communication skills with employee. The hour was great because it gave you time time spend with your family or to spend time doing thing you like. They all way found something for you to went work was do which is great because you can learn a new department.
good,"fast paced "
good,"Pretty laid back, Your basically self teaching yourself by browsing all work apps.  You have to have Really have initiative and exceptional Csr skills."
good,"Lots of merchandise to place. it was a challenge sometimes finding a solution to putting out the new merchandise Low wages for seasoned associates. a very bad review policy, i dont agree with."
good,"Not a bad black to work, but company is having financial issues.  Don't have anything bad to say other than they are facing the same challenges that other similar retailers are."
good,"Busy day everyday."
good,"It was a fun place to work but got pretty stressful during Christmas.  I worked on sales transactions and balancing the cash drawer.  I helped customers find what they were looking for.  The employee discount was nice too!  Sometimes micromanaging, by the supervisor, was annoying."
good,"We had a terrific management team, from the general manager down to each department supervisors.  Leading the way in exceptional customer service which was practiced by every associate in the building."
good,"always kept me busy, taught me more communication skills. co-workers were nice, and always helpful. the hardest part of the job was to always keep clothing organized."
good,"Folded clothes everyday, scanned them to totes using an RF scanner and put them on a conveyor. The co-workers were very polite but everyone usually kept to themselves. Very advanced warehouse on a technological level. Management was very polite and understanding. But we're very uninformed about everything"
good,"First we would unload the truck into organized piles like men's clothes, women's cloths, shoe's and home products. Then we open each pile one by one. If they are clothes we have to tag them. Occasionally will have to move furniture."
good,Decent company. Loss Prevention team very professional and did exceptional work. Great leaders. Store management teams and associates are enjoyable and offer great service.
good,i loved this job. i was a sales associate at the jewelry counter. i love picking out jewelry for customers to wear matching thier outfits or just for special occasions. employees were all friendly.
good,"To say it's the best job I've had so far is the honest truth, but I would much rather have been in a better position. I found it difficult to meet the standards for the makeup counter I was at. I enjoyed all the people I worked with and miss it to this day compared to what I was doing after I had left. The advancement was slim, like so slim no one had been promoted in 20 something years. Nothing changes and it stays the same as far as the HR goes but the other employees throughout the store is constantly changing. I would've loved to stay but like I said, I saw no advancement opportunities unless I stayed until the higher up's dropped dead. I have a lot of life in me and I can't afford to live on such weak pay/commission to wait for that."
good,"I spent my days at Bon-Ton reviewing store financial plans, inventory levels and sales. I learned the skill set for financial planning, inventory allocation, inventory balances management and replenishment models. My co-workers were a lot of fun and we had a good time during the day, however we were all feeling micromanaged having anywhere from 3-5 supervisors to report to on a daily basis, all with different expectations. I enjoyed the culture of working with cosmetics and handbags, and also enjoyed my vendor relationships which was my best area within the job."
good,"Good job,i learned that its not easy. The hardest part of my job was the drama between co workers and dealing with rude customers.Overall i loved my job but i didn't get the full time hours that i needed"
good,"Typical retail job. Dealing with the public always has it's challenges.  While I enjoyed several people that I worked with day to day, working retail is always a great reminder of how we can be a better person.  being more thoughtful, patient, and even tempered during a situation out of our control."
good,"It's retail.  .  Unless it's dead, there is always something to do. Things such as putting things away, taking care of customers,"
good,"Recruiting and hiring, manage store, customer service, payroll.  Enjoy the team, and customers.  "
good,"started as associate and advanced to dept. manager."
good,"Typical Work month is M-F 9a.m. until 6p.m. working two Saturdays per month unless in promotion. *Please note that is 70% of the year*"
good,"I have learned to adapt to an ever changing environment, I learn quickly, am exceptionally organized, and always wanting to learn more and take on new responsibilities."
good,"A typical day at work would be constantly standing behind a counter, helping customers and meeting there needs, the hardest part of the job is trying to go on your breaks."
good,"Worked there as part of a seasonal hire spree. Provided support to customers who were in store and was expected to upsell electronics section daily, honest living."
good,"Worked for company for 30 years.Upper management igorned signs of company "
good,"The work wasn't bad for the average active person. It's face-paced and you do have to be on your game. But they are slave drivers and often require 7 days a week, 16 hours a day shifts."
good,Learn a lot from head bosses to Supervisor I was train and had a lot of opportunities to do well sad that they closed down it was a Great place to work for and the supervisor and a lot of overtime
good,"Bon-Ton is no longer in business, so I am just putting in characters because I'm required to.  How do you make a tissue dance?  You put a little boogie in it.  Have a great day!"
good,"You worked really hard, lots of hours, not a lot of money, but the employees and management made it feel like family  The Company went out of business."
good,"When opening the store in the mornings, you would clock in and head upstairs for a quick meeting and then you would head to your section and open the register. Throughout the day you will be helping customers with purchase both in store and online. Cleaning out fitting rooms and providing excellent customer service while meeting the 4 goals of the company. I learned how to manage my time and to think on my feet. The store manager could have been nicer and HR was a little difficult to work with you when you needed a day off from school or for a event. The hardest part is asking a customer if they would like to open a charge card and setting up sales from the next day. The most enjoyable part is the discounts and being able to work in different sections every so often."
good,This was a fine job to have if you are looking for a little extra money. Had good and bad aspects as most jobs do. I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,Old style retail department store - now out of business. The final years were difficult with sales goals often unrealistic. Some managers were inexperienced.
good,"Enjoyed working at Bon Ton"
good,Originally neatness and appearance of merchandise was of prime importance along with customer satisfaction.  Everything was fine until the store was taken over by creditors and finally closed. The last few weeks were not nice.
good,A typical day at work i would unload truck and take all products to the floor. I learned quite a bit towards how to tag merchandise. Management was great and always helpful.
good,"I worked at BonTon during my winter breaks and in the summer for extra school money. The business was suffering for sales and eventually closed."
good,"Although the company was a fairly large corporation at the time of my employment, working daily in my store often felt more like a family oriented experience. Everyone got along for the most part, and helped each other on tasks and projects without complaining. That type of setting is, in my opinion, what I look for in any job. "
good,"Coupon policy changed with every customer.  The managers refused to come up when a manager requested to see them."
good,Every day we would come in and all meet up in a group. Talk about what all needs to be done and what our goals were for the day. Then we would all do our stretches as a group. Then manager would tell everyone where they were going and we would all get started.
good,"I applied at Bon-Ton almost 3 yrs. ago as a seasonal sales associate in the Shoe Department and stayed after the holiday.  "
good,"I’ve worked for BonTon for roughly 3 years, the hours are long because many employees call off or don’t come in, Management is easy to get along with except for the general manager and HR they sit in their offices way too much. You have to solicit charge accounts otherwise you get into trouble."
good,"It’s a normal retail job. There’s nothing to it. Just folding clothes, stocking, etc. it’s for a starter that’s looking to make money quickly, not for career paths."
good,"The hardest part of the job was working through the systems, there were six different systems."
good,"working at bonton was overall ok, there were many great people who've worked there that were very nice and easy to work with, but recently since the company went bankrupt i was sadly laid off"
good,My boss challenged me and allowed me to grow based off of my strengths. The workplace was wonderful because it was in the mall right next to the YMCA. I worked out everyday.
good,"Working at Bonton was a pleasant experience. We focused on collaboration, team building and innovation. We did our best to turn the company around but was over powered by upper management."
good,"Bon-Ton had a team of very talented and hard-working employees -- both in the stores and at corporate. Unfortunately, senior management was slow to adapt to changes in the retail landscape and the company was burdened by overwhelming debt."
good,"They constantly scheduled against availability, i stated my availability several times but was still scheduled for hours that I couldn't work. The management was out of touch with the staff and their needs."
good,"Unfortunately, Bon-ton is going out of business, but while I was there I worked with some tremendous people who have a lot to offer. Retail is a changing field and not all companies are able to adapt to e-commerce."
good,The most enjoyable thing working at Bon-Ton was customer service. I enjoyed having the ability to help others and put a smile on someone’s  faces and having conversation with others.
good,Great People to work with on a daily basis. Leadership very open and willing to listen to potential changes and new ideas. Culture one that cultivates teamwork.
good,never give raises or annual reviews but everything else within the job is pretty good especially the flexibility. I had a really good very fair manager and what i loved most was the work at home environment you feel more productive due to not being forced to work in an office where there is a lot of politics and drama going on that affect your work and performance.
good,"The furniture gallery as a singular store was great working experience. My coworkers and I were able to work well together. Unfortunately, the corporate administration that oversees our store were very unpleasant and difficult to work with, to say the least. Corporate was more concerned about the sales and profit coming in rather than the well being and overall experience of the customer."
good,"I have worked here for 8 years, there is opportunity when you reach for it. I have been in 3 different positions and all positions have helped me grow as a professional."
good,"very quick paced enviroment, paid breaks not paid lunches. nice lockers and coat racks as well as refrigerators for your lunch. Managers were not to bad."
good,Seasonal employment during black Friday and the Christmas season.   Responsibilities included loading and unloading trucks with merchandise to be placed in store as well as shipped out.
good,The BonTon was a nice place to work  at that time. They had a nice discount program and gave incentive program for sales and always had class for sales to public classes
good,I was able to learn the entire store wasn't subjected to one department.  I learned some very good skills that beneifited not the company but myself also.
good,"floor loading by hand, for the shipping section, very fast-paced job environment. Receiving consisted of taking the products off the truck for immediate sorting"
good,I learned to enjoy helping others and always be truthful to the place I learn how to handle money and learn the full store in 2 months I learn to enjoy working with a lot of people good and bad.
good,"The position as warehouse worker was pretty laid back for the most part. We did do more the just warehouse work, unloading trucks, helping with displays. It was a nice place to weork"
good,"I worked in the accessories department exclusively, which was either boring or complicated. No one came to the jewelry counter unless they had to get their watch fixed or buy a bus pass, both of which I was not trained to do."
good,I liked the job but getting enough hours was very difficult.  They wanted to keep my hours to a minimum except during the X-mas season. Most of the people were good to work with.  The store manager was not.  She was very patronizing and I tried to avoid her whenever possible.
good,"While employed at the Bon-Ton for over a year I have gained a lot of new skills. Once you gain a good reputation, they expect a lot out of you. There is two different groups of sales associates at Bon-Ton, those that work to full potential and then some and others that take up space on the schedule. A typical day includes performing opening and closing procedures, customer service, and maintaining sales floor."
good,"Responsible for ensuring the safe, efficient and accurate handling and processing of outbound merchandise and supplies through the Distribution Center."
good,An okay place to work. Management was fine. Pay was decent. Could have been better. Store managers tried their hardest to keep the store as clean and presentable as possible. Environment was happy.
good,"the customers, not the actual company, were probably the biggest problems i had. i worked alongside some really nice people and i liked the manager, but the people who shop there are...not the best."
good,"Spent shifts getting customers shoes, putting new shoes out, opening charge accounts.  Typical retail job with no benefits and minimum wage.  Somewhat flexible with scheduling."
good,The company and it's senior executives have a very traditional and tunnel-vision way of looking at things. The CEO considers Facebook to be the scope of social media - refuses to invest the necessary time and resources into understanding digital media. Relies on traditional marketing tactics. Guess what? It's not working!! Company hasn't turned profit in years. Stock value drops daily. Only positives are the location in the heart of downtown Milwaukee and the employee discount.
good,New environment provided more experience. Many tasks prevent boredom and well oriented work habits. Very poor management team and lack of safety concerns.
good,"I liked interacting with the customers, but the Parisian I worked at grew increasingly slow and it was difficult to stay focused and not talk when there were no customers to help."
good,I have came to the conclusion that Bonton is merely a stepping stone for your career. It is a good place to begin your journey and gain experience so you can move on to bigger and better opportunities.
good,"Fun to be around the products"
good,The job was a great start to a customer service aspect I learned how to deal with different kind of people in a customer aspect and co worker aspect
good,"While at Bon-Ton, I felt very rushed everyday. I felt as though I could not ask questions and had very little training. Unfortunately it was very frustrating for me to work there."
good,No surprises. Employee discount is nice and can usually be combined with sale prices and coupons for some nice deals on clothing and housewares.
good,"I enjoy my customers and the people I work with. They are always helpful and friendly. There is always something to do so never a dull moment."
good,Great company for sesonal. There was alot of changes that cause alot of associates to look for diffrent work some associotes were looking for better job with great benifits
good,"I enjoyed working at bon ton, greeting customers, helping them with their selections, giving them ideas to add more products to their selections."
good,It was an ok job . I had a good time working for them . It was an easy job wish they would have more communication with employees.
good,"only 10-12 hrs a week except at the holidays. good management, personable co workers, high priced ins. great discount"
good,Decent money but currently understaffed. Little to no opportunity for advancement. Good co-workers. Great benefits package. Issue escalated are patched than fixed. A lot is re-occurring problems.
good,"Worked there for the holidays this past year, mostly running register and answering phone. Enjoyed the fast pace of the job and got along with most of the managers I encountered on a daily basis. Got along well with co workers,no problems or personality clashes."
good,"I enjoy the constant change in the job on a day to day basis.  Some days lots of truck, others meetings and then associate reviews - never boring."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working for the company.  I enjoyed the flexibility of the job and interaction with the customers and/or co-workers.  The one constant thing in Retail is that it is always changing."
good,"I do not have a review to offer at this time. Everyone was extremely nice and focused on driving sales.  Thank you"
good,Worked in the Traffic Department load planning and working with vendors.  Learned Load Planning and managing vendor profiles.  Worked with some very hard working and friendly co-workers.  Most enjoyable part of the job was setting up new vendor profiles and helping the vendors get their merchandise routed to the Distribution Center.
good,"Good work place"
good,Overall a decent place to work .. you need to be in charge of your own development though if you want to learn something you have to seek it out
good,"on truck day started at 4:00 am in morning unload truck 3-4 hours. Work on putting merchandise on carts and security tagging. Bring items to floor ,change  some lights . in summer wash store windows."
good,"open credit lines"
good,A typical day at work could be anything. You never know what the day will hold since it's a mystery. Management are ok to work with.
good,Good family orientated environment. Overall experience depends on store and store management. Behind on competitive pay.
good,"Fast Paced Demanding Retail Environment. In a Day: Customer Service, Register Transactions, Accommodation Preparation, Display and Visual Set ups, Fitting Room Checks, Merchandise Maintenance, Restocking and Reorganizing, etc."
good,"A typical day at work included folding clothes, re-arranging shelves and organizing fixtures. I also cleaned out fitting rooms of unwanted clothing."
good,Always learning new things.  Fast pace makes shifts interesting.  Always meeting new people.  Opportunity for growth.
good,"If your looking for a good employer in the Northeast area, Bon-Ton is the place to be."
good,"was a decent job while in between careers. sold jewelry and set goals. management was always changing."
good,"fast paced, need to be able to multi task and manage time table"
good,"Handling calls from stores across the country, creating help desk tickets, learning about all the applications within the company, monitoring outages and the network"
good,"not enough hours, pay was low, loved the employees hated the management"
good,"During my employment I sharpened my people skills. Working with the public is a skill that can be very valuable. During a typical day I would assist individuals with their purchases, and also maintain a welcoming environment for customers."
good,"A typical day consisted of helping customers, putting product out and recovering sales floor. I was able to learn how to interact with customers in a profession and assertive manor. Friendly and supportive coworkers and management team. Most enjoyable part of the job was having customers leave satisfied."
good,"Seeking something more stable, more opportunity for advancement"
good,"Schedules varied weekly to meet the needs of the store. "
good,"The company is fairly flexible with hours however they tend to make you work just enough hours to still be considered part time, so that they don't have to give you benefits of the full time employee status. Expect to work many holidays, nights, and weekends. Management pushes employees very hard to have customers open a charge card. If the company doesn't hit its target goal, the employees will hear about it OFTEN. I have seen an employee be reprimanded in front of customers for not opening enough charges. A lot is expected of the floor managers but the pay is less than motivating. There is room for growth with the company but the pay doesn't go up by much when you're promoted. It's almost better to stay a regular associate than to take a promotion. Depending on the employees, the work can be fun. Interacting with the customers can be fun as well."
good,The skills that I acquired at this job were a strong stepping stone into the working world by gaining knowledge of a shipping and receiving department as well as the maintenance and custodial aspects of a professional company. These skills have been used to acquire higher levels of job placement.
good,Not very cooperative to being flexible and pay and benefits not very acceptable to today.
good,Working at the Bon Ton was a great experience for me.  The store is family owned and has many employees who have been there for twenty or more years.
good,"Our version of Macy's. Gets busy at times, my co-workers and I get along good and they are helpful."
good,Bon-Ton was always busy which i liked because i have to always be doing something productive.
good,"Go to work at 11:15 am till 8:00 pm."
good,Great job when balancing being a student and an employee. Fun place to work and knowledgeable about fashion for each season.
good,"sales merchandising, customer service, good co-workers."
good,good people good manager
good,Inexperienced associates were made supervisors over experienced employees. Managers had favorites and overlooked their mistakes.
good,"It was my first job, so everything was new to me, but i learned so much and i'm happy about my experience"
good,Everything was good until they went bankrupt and waited til last minute to tell employees. The overall experience was good and there was room for promotions.
good,"Bon Ton declared bankruptcy, so management at the top was bad. I came on to a sinking ship. But I believe that the store manager was doing her best to save this location. So, my review of management is mixed. Coworkers were great, working there was fun, but short lived. I would loved to have worked there longer to see where my career went."
good,"In liquidation, currently still employed here till June 5th. Unfortunately this company with great history will not be moving forward in the retail area."
good,"I have worked at The Bonton Stores Inc for +20 yrs.  I have enjoyed working here surrounded by energetic, caring people with a love of retail.  I have worked in many areas including buying, planning and ecommerce.  I am sad that The Bonton Stores will no longer be able to serve their communities."
good,The store is closing so there are no opportunities. It was a good place to work. The culture has changed. I will miss my co workers but now I'm looking forward to it being over.
good,"The ability to help women of all ages to achieve their ultimate beauty goals is a rewarding experience. Along with the ability to forge lasting relationships with clients, the team-spirit of our working environment made each day a pleasant experience."
good,"A typical day at work can be anything from usual cleaning, stocking, and cashing, all the way up to including working on truck, managing your own department, and having to actively train new employees.  Although the workers are very friendly, which makes doing the job feel like cleaning a house, the active work the management does to put more work on less employees, without compensating them for doing more than their title would assume, has become an issue in the last few years."
good,Its an okay job for someone in school still to make a little extra money. Every department had its own perks. If you open credit card accounts you get paid a bit more.
good,"I enjoyed learning new things about customer service and consumerism from Bon-Ton. Since the store is located in Chambersburg Mall, it can get very dead very quickly. Do not let this be your only job."
good,It is very relaxed there until it gets busy. You receive decent pay and get associate discounts. Work environment was very dull.
good,Retail is a tough market right now but it's a good place to work. The people are great and it has a pretty social element to the culture.
good,"Busy days fly by, slow ones, not so much.  Learned the value of customer service for everyone.  Appreciate loyal, local customers, they make it all worthwhile."
good,The business needs had employees consistently busy from beginning of shift to the end of shift. Working in multiple areas within store was nice because customers would come in with many needs. Being able to provide great customer service was important to the BonTon and to me.
good,"I was hired as a temp with the promise to be kept on, then last minute was let go. Management was alright, nothing too special. My coworkers were very friendly and always willing to help me. Learned a lot about customer service and retail."
good,"I love my job and I love what I do.  Everyday is something different.  My associates are wonderful, I would not change anything about any of them.  I learned so much from my assistant manager since I have worked there and I continue to learn from her.  The hardest part of my job has been at times being able to balance personal life and work."
good,Retail is definitely an indusry of peaks and valleys but there were many more valleys at The Bon Ton and you rarely bonused. Great place to begin your career with the amount of responsibility you are given and the scope of activities you get involved with. But if you see yourself moving past a Buyer or Planner level there is quite a bottleneck.
good,"My typical day at work was helping customers, folding clothes most of the day rang register and waited on customers.  I learned to be more patient with people and don't get to frustrated.  It is just not worth it.  Management was not what I would have thought it would be.  My co-workers I pretty much tolerated.   I think the hardest part of the job was my co-workers bossing me around and their associates just like me.   The most enjoyable part of job was leaving for the day."
good,"While working at The Bon-Ton, there were a lot of problems with coupons and the advertisements that were put up in the store. People who received these coupons were not expecting to have to find the items that will work with the coupon. There was a long list of exclusions. As a cashier, explaining this to each costumer was tiring. About 80% of people had to get out of line and find other items that would make the coupon work. "
good,"good part time job while it lasted.  unforturnately, went out of business.  Poor management,  lack of product,  failure to attract customers - higher prices than online."
good,"Good part time work. Had just had a baby at the time. They were very understanding. The only reason I left, I was offered a job at my family’s business."
good,"A typical day at Bon-Ton was never typical. Being responsible for many different software vendors, it was always something different. Management gave me the freedom to learn at my own pace. The culture was always taking care of your customer. The hardest part of the job was being on call late at night. The best part of the job was always doing something different and working with great people."
good,"For this job I had good hours, mostly Monday through Friday which is unusual in retail. I had an occasional night but no weekends. I audited the store so we were ready for the state auditor."
good,"overall Bon Ton was a good place to work, I felt sometimes that Management was not doing a very good job. a lot of money was spent on temporary  people that didn't care about the quality of their work and the amount of work that they ""didn't do"". There was not enough authority to correct was going on."
good,"There is a good work/life balance at The Bon-Ton Stores. "
good,"For the most part i did not enjoy working at Bon-Ton INC because the management was awful, The evening manager was rude and the store manager seemed under-trained. My fellow employees there were great, very sweet, and kind."
good,"I have enjoyed working with Bon-Ton. The discounts are nice and so is the atmosphere. In the time I've worked there however, there has been a lack of communication among management which causes issues and unneeded stress."
good,Bon-Ton is a good place to work if you have a cut-throat mentality. As a manager for a number of years I enjoyed to the challenges of managing different departments and different teams. There was a lot pf pressure for opening credit cards on management and team members. It was a daily talk and if goals were not met there are consequences. Nothing serious but further coachings and mandatory training. I enjoyed the high pressure to get certain goals met but felt that after a few years I needed a change.
good,"A typical day at Bon-Ton was just an average day. I show up and I work until it's time to leave or they start asking employees to leave because of low production. I didn't learn very much since I have already had previous picking experience. The management was okay, none of the managers seemed to be very helpful. I enjoyed my co-workers, a lot of us felt kind of the same towards the job itself and but we all worked hard and were very polite. The hardest part of the job would have to be finding something to do when there were no waves of picks. The most enjoyable part of the job to me was when we would have a steady day of work with no gaps in-between picks."
good,"A typical day consisted of performing store audits on various merchandise sold, and checking with store management on any persisting issues in the store.  Check with superiors for new directives or policies.  Loss prevention was mismanaged, and constantly changing.  I worked for three different district managers, two different regional managers, and three different internal investigators in my one year there.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the constant change in management, and the best part was being able to work primarily on my own."
good,"DC was an interesting place to work.  Associates were mostly friendly. Management was okay except the communication wasn't always ideal.  Overall I enjoyed the time I was there, even in the long weeks during the Christmas busy season."
good,"You know, everyone was relatively nice and respectful, but unfortunately it's not enough. The store manager just didn't care about the employees. Backward priorities and poor communication skills. Also, a raise of 10 cents, after a year of working there, putting in true effort, just isn't acceptable."
good,"As a Human Resource Rep, my day started out with a plan of what would get done. However, due to the nature of the position, I was often interrupted and had to shift my priorities. Loved the fast paced, ever changing position as a Human Resource Rep and working with all the associates and helping with their needs."
good,I enjoyed the management a lot. I believe that they under pay their employees.
good,"I love the team here at my store.  The Supervisors can be pretty annoying, but the Store Manager and her Assistant are terriffic.  The sale sets are dumb, too.  Why do they need to change the sales every other day?  Also, the store needs a serious face lift.  Benefits are okay but the pay is lower than competators"
good,I worked as a security/loss prevention officer and was not a good fit for this job.
good,"It's a nice and relaxed workplace environment, but it lacks sales productivity."
good,I learned a lot about the world of retail and merchandising. It's an extremely fast paced environment and challenging. I have learned to be more organized and a better multi tasker given how busy my days are. I worked well with my team and took the time to truly understand how their role impacts mine.
good,I love working with bon ton. My co workers where like family im great with people the only hard part about some of the day were when they was slow maybe 5 to 10 trucks but we always find othen things around the plant the needes a touch up
good,bonton closed and jobs were terminated. not much more to say about that. I think its ridiculous that i am required to write a review because my job and this company no longer exists
good,Data Entry of clothing and making sure the style is online. Also transferring styles out of the warehouse to the photo studio to make sure it gets online. I learned a lot about the fashion industry. The management here is great depending who you are with. Co-workers here are awesome. Nothing to hard about the job. It's pretty laid back and easy. The most enjoyable part about the job is that it is flexible.
good,Management at my store was superb. We dealt directly with our Regional manager who was extremely efficient and understanding. You are basically a secret shopper busting people for stealing merchandise. I also ran all of the safety audits on a monthly bassis along with register and purchase reportson a weekly basis. Since we reported directly to our Regional Manager and I was the only LP associate in the store I acted as more of a manager training staff and conducting investigations along with interogations and all of the paperwork involved.
good,"this company is DMC of Dubai, work culture is good and overall good experience to  work over there"
good,"they where flexible if people needed time off for family situations , provided training when we changed to new systems, the hardest was having some time restrains on things and not having enough people to get it done"
good,Don't have one it's a job with  managers learn your job do your job in a timely manner make sure it's done right and move on the more work the faster the clock moves
good,"Good company, associates are happy to work here. professional environment.  managements treat and coache associates  positive manner to make sales goals."
good,"We all have a lot to do each day, but we all pull together to all tasks done.  We are all heart broken with the store closing.  We are going to miss one another dearly."
good,Productive and fun workplace very friendly people. Learned a lot about myself and the retail industry at this company. My Manager was always willing to help me grow.
good,"The job was great, supervisors and co workers are friendly and great, and the manager was ok. If you enjoy organizing and folding clothes then this is the job for you. Being on the pick team was enjoyable and not hard, placement aka stocking was easy and will be easier especially in the home department if you are physically strong. Cashiering is ok but of course it has it's ups and downs like when you have to deal with rude or angry customers. The discount that you get is good too but you can only use cash while you use your discount card and that's the only issue I've had with it but overall it was an ok experience."
good,"Overall great job,loved helping people with skin problems and beauty advice."
good,"In-Store management at the BonTon is fantastic.They treat every employee as a valuable member of the team. My co-workers are all very cooperative and everyone gets along well. "
good,"Working for Bonton can be good and bad. The people and management i work with are great to work for and with. Sometimes management can be hard to be around but for most they are great to work for. Working thier is very stressful and takes a lot of patients and you need a lot of it. It gets difficult and is easy to lose your cool. Things I love thier are my co workers and a lot of my customers which makes it nice too. What I don't like thier is low pay I feel we should be making more then what we do because they are a high end store and we put up with a lot, working holidays is demanded on you, I feel that long time employees should have choice of working holidays or choose to work thanksgiving or Christmas eve, and not enough workers."
good,"Worked as a team member preforming cashier duties, product assistance and cleaning while providing customer service."
good,"Taught me a lot about sales and improved my communication skills, problem-solving skills, customer service, etc. Although there were downfalls about the company, I enjoyed working with my coworkers and managers. They are always there for you and motivate you to do your best."
good,"Good management team, friendly co-workers, hard to advance, great starter job in retail, limited responsibility, great customer service."
good,"Never a dull moment. Constant work to be done on a daily basis, Plenty of room for advancement. many different opportunities to grow and learn."
good,"Traveling to stores, four days a week, working closely with Regional Visual Directors, Store Managers, Department Managers, and Polo Specialists.  "
good,"A typical day at work was average paced, not too busy and not too slow. Overall, it provided good customer service experience and a look into the retail community."
good,The BonTon gave me the freedom to become better in every aspect of being a supervisor and increasing my ability in the maintenance aspect of my job. I enjoyed the challenge of my many different responsibilities and learned to delegate when needed and to use my time wisely. I grew as a supervisor by being allowed to be included in the interviewing process and also the disiplinary process
good,"I enjoyed my time at Bon Ton. I loved the management in our store. They were great to work with. "
good,"It was a very nice and peaceful environment with my co-workers, hours were flexible unfortunately the store in Hamden closed. I liked the job because it was a great company."
good,"Not a bad job just a ""cady"" ""stuffy"" environment with no advancement. Not enough hours and inconsistent. A lot of gossip and a clique type of workplace."
good,I worked at the Clinique counter but the cosmetic manager was horrible but they have a new and amazing one!  And they have a  new store manager as well which is good! It can be face paced depending on the time of year.
good,"I go into work with a positive attitude, it is very slow and im used to a fast pace. Dont judge a book by its cover. Our management is ok some of our managers i love they are great people but the others harass me because they want more of what i have to offer as far as my sales and it makes them look good so of course they want more. most of my co-workers are great people and they are hard working. the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that i put my best foot forward and always 100%."
good,I enjoyed working with the customers. I also had my own department I worked in everyday. So I knew where everything was located and could keep up with organization. The only negative part about this job was the pay. I enjoyed working in retail but the pay was extremely low for the amount of work that was done.
good,setting up merchandise for sales. assisting customers with purchases
good,I love the job it is great to meet so many different people and talk. Management could be better and they need to get rid of some people. most of the coworkers are awesome there are a few that need to leave.
good,You had to work very hard there for very low pay. Left there many days feeling so tired I didn't want to go back. Forced to work 12 hours on Black Friday. Glad it was only for 3 months. If a manager saw you without something to do for 2 minutes they were on your case...like they had nothing else to do. Racks and racks of clothes to put away. Working in ladies coats was a back breaker. I would never work thereagain.
good,Bon-Ton is currently going out of business but when I did work there the calls coming in were sometimes stressful.  We helped customers with their orders.
good,"Everyday is different, which is to be expected in the retail industry.  Depending on your management team, daily tasks can become quite stressful.  Communication is key.  Management needs to encourage and guide their team members instead of making all the decisions on their own.  Bon-Ton has a lot of room to grow and flourish, if only their employees were empowered to do so without management approval on every tiny task.  The retail world is rapidly changing and management needs to get on board or move on with their own careers."
good,I enjoyed the year I worked there with my co- workers. There were a few on management team esp Store mgr. She would walk right by you and not even acknowledge you say good morning or anything. She would pace back and forth and constantly tell you what she didn't like never a praise to anyone for good work.
good,"Most associates at Bon Ton are great to work with, it is definitely an environment where you feel like a big family when the going gets tough. "
good,Great place to work. You must be ready to interact with customers. Also it is a plus to have prior retail experience. This is a very fast pace working environment with multiple changing factors as far as what is expected each week. Being able to adapt to change is a must!
good,"My coworker are like a family, managment is helpful, kind and strong leaders. Everyone helps one another the company has an week with food and drinks for lunch to honor service."
good,i didnt mind the people that i worked with but management had a hard time working with the college schedule that i had and continued to work me on times that i had class
good,i really enjoyed working there for the summer time and i wish that it never went bankrupt. they hired even though they were going out of business which i appreciated . it was a fun job for all the employees.
good,"I liked the people I worked with.  But Price Changes was one of my jobs as a Merchandise Assistant.  It took up a lot of time, sometimes that is all I would do, to many sales!  I think since this was so important that the Buyer or Assistant Buyer should of had that responsibility.  But you were basically free to work whatever hours, as long as you put in 8 hours daily.  Overtime was frown on, even thou sometimes you need it to get all your work done."
good,Just did get alot of hours. fun people and management helped alot when i needed it the floor is eay to maintain and the customers are great.if i could go back i would
good,"Worked the cash register checking out the customer's purchases worked in the dressing rooms, restocking clothing assisted customers with finding items"
good,"Some of the workers are nice, management is completely slow, they complain about money loss but will return something from a customer that has been worn, torn, and bought five years ago. Not afraid to make you look stupid in front of a customer. RACIST, at least at my location. Commission is fine but the hourly pay is unbelievable for all that you have to do."
good,Run cash registers and stock merchandise and set sale. Enjoyed going in for a couple hours at a time running the cash register and helping customers with their purchases.
good,"attendance was average needs a bit improvement"
good,"it was always busy and something always needed to be done. I learned instant credit, loved it even got approve myself. managmnet could have ben better. co workers were friendly an willing to lend a helping hand. the hardest part of the job was always changing departments, if you didn't know shoe it was the most difficult. Most enjoyable part of the job was returns could you would see items on the sales floor n would just have to buy them!"
good,"A typical day at work would be fast-paced, learned sales techniques, okay management. Friendly co-workers, most enjoyable part of job are the customers."
good,"Cashier at major retail store, minimal hours available.Cleaning up after closing."
good,Planning was not my gig. Left after 4 months training was not good.
good,Awesome environment to work in. Amazing customer skills and customers. Clean place. Fun and friendly environment. Very involved with holidays and celebrations.
good,"A typical day at work involved providing support for all the Departments on the Sales Floor as a Cash Office Associate. The workplace culture was very, very busy, during certain events, and competitive in some departments.The most enjoyable part of my job at the time was being of service. What I learned as a former employee of this organization after returning as a Cash Office Associate (14 years later) is how isolated I felt  working as a Cash Office Associate instead of a Selling Associate on the Sales floor in the Women's Studio. An opportunity to interact with co-workers and be among our customers on the Sales Floor was most gratifying."
good,"Typical retail hours including nights and weekends"
good,"I'm new to this position, so far its okay. Be prepared to work at your pace and have zero instruction. My current manager is very catty and immature. Causes a lot of drama in our cubicle. The work is easy once you get a hang of it."
good,"A pleasant and professional company, dedicated to their customers. They encourage customer service associate decisions to benefit customers of all types.  They provide food, support and assistance to associates especially during the Christmas season.  I was proud to work for them."
good,"I enjoy being with people and helping people and that is what I do at The Bon Ton, customer service.  Help the customers find what they are looking for, total their sales and put away clothing from the fitting rooms and straighten up the displays."
good,"Hired for seasonal work (11/03-2/04). Responsibilities included assisting customers, setting up for next-day sales, interacting with peers and customers, setting up inventory, daily interaction with customers/peers, opening and closing store registers"
good,"Bon Ton is now closed, but it was definitely one of my favorite jobs to work at, simply because of my co-workers and the management team. We all had our fair share of nightmare customers, but the team kept me afloat."
good,"Bon Ton is no longer in business, due to poor corporate management decisions. There was always a sale to set and often we didn't have enough people to set it. Often there were times we were shorthanded, especially at the end (people called off because they didn't care)"
good,"I learned how to stock clothing, run the cash register, do returns, do credit card purchases, do gift cards, and how to set up displays.  Worked with mostly women who were great to work with. Did mostly cashier work unless it was slow and then worked in the men's dept, Hardest part was knowing how to do all the transactions and the best part was the people I worked with."
good,"The company offers benefits even for part-time associates, and perks for selling their store credit cars, plus a 20% discount. There are many opportunities for advancement as well."
good,perfect for a first job or a place to grow and branch out into other areas and figure out what you actually want in a career. very nice place to work.
good,"A good place for high school students to work and learn organization, communication, numeracy, and patients skills as well as learning the ways of how a store works."
good,During the holiday season we would have to meet goals and if we did we would get an extra $2 every hour we worked. We were off every weekend except during the holiday season.
good,"BONTON was a great place to work, it was all about the people. Sad a 100+ year business will no longer be in operation, but that is the current state of retail."
good,Management & associates are approachable and willing to work together to ensure the success of the company and individuals.  
good,"This pertains only to the small segment of the company that I was involved with ( I was one of more than 20,000 ). I worked in a true team, that reacted to every challenge with a positive spirit. I was given plenty of autonomy and support to get my job done, and trusted to determine my own hours, and work at home opportunities."
good,"As a Sales Associate I served as a cashier, aided 150+ customers each shift, and managed inventory in all retail departments except the Accessories Department."
good,"Was a good place to work, many opportunities to advance. Store manager and HR managers were knowledgeable and always available for advice, willing to help in all aspects of the job."
good,It was a good place to work. I spent 16 years with the company and worked with amazing people who are dedicated and passionate about their work. I will miss it.
good,"Fun and fulfilling environment that I looked forward to attending daily. Flexible hours and time off, as well as room for upward mobility. I would recommend to others to work at Bon-Ton."
good,"There is always something to do either with cleaning and organizing the store and/or clothing, or helping customers. Customer service skills are definitely needed because there is a large variety of people that shop at this store."
good,My job was mostly focused on the accounts payable and the sub-contractors would want paid and the owner wouldn't want to release payment due to work not being what he felt was up to pare. It could get very ugly in the office.
good,Good environment to be in. room for advancement and people care about their positions. leadership is supportive and eager to help in anyway. liked my time there.
good,Friendly place to work and good co-workers. Working at Bon ton will improve your communication skills. Good first job.
good,"I was hired at the Bon-ton as a seasonal associate for Christmas time and as soon as I started my first day I knew I was going to really enjoy the atmosphere. All the members of management were welcoming and always made you feel important, while the other employees always put a smile on your face as well as the costumers. Working as a sales associate at the Bon-ton during the holidays went constant costumer service which was my favorite part about the job, because in a way they became about of the store. Each day, no matter what shift, not only would I run register but would walk around the store folding clothes and maintaining the stores appearance while trying to interact with costumers to make sales. You could always keep busy!"
good,"Typically, customers and employees are all very friendly and outgoing. Management wasn't too great, but you can't have it all. Being seasonal typically means that no one there actually cares about you, but all in all, it wasn't bad."
good,"Typical day at work included giving great customer service while merchandising merchandise. Co-workers were friendly and easygoing. At Bon-Ton, you learn management skills while improving customer service skills. The hardest part of the job was associating with rude customers who were prejudice or made you feel uncomfortable. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of giving the customer the best support that could be given."
good,"A typical day is opening the cash register, setting up sale signs, selling jewelry to customers, creating client relationships using client cards, closing sales, closing cash register, handling money, and working on a sales quota."
good,"Like most of retail, The Bon Ton has a do more with less philosophy.  They have struggled for several years and the upcoming year seems to be poised for a similar outcome.  The company is down sizing and eliminating positions due to debt and a lack of investment. "
good,"The experience and knowledge that I gained there was vital to my future development as a career woman. I was able to supervise, and manage my own staff. I had the ability to propose ideas, and execute them. I enjoyed being there for my associates, not only as a supervisor, but as a mentor as well. They felt comfortable to come to me with any problems they had within the company, or with a customer that day. I enjoyed working with customers, and the customer service aspect. I had people, often ask me, if I was the BonTon customer service agent. The reason I left BonTon will not be disclosed to public knowledge."
good,All of my coworkers are very friendly and are always there to help if needed. Even the managers are very friendly and do not control you. The store manager makes sure that she meets new hires as soon as possible.
good,Loved working in the home store department. Coworkers were like family members. Holidays were very busy but that made the work day go by quicker.
good,"To be honest, I quite enjoyed my job and had few issues with the company... until I found out that despite the company formally recognizing my hard-work and dedication they were hiring new associates at over a dollar more an hour than I made. When I approached human resources to attempt to obtain a raise, I was told the hourly wage I was making was ""impossible"" as everyone (else) had been raised significantly above it the review period earlier. Even after confirming that I was by far the lowest paid employee in the store, they still would not agree to raise my wages. Only after punching out on my last day of work, the store manager approached me and offered to match the salary of the company I was moving to. Too little, too late"
good,"A typical day at work consists of interacting with new clients. Skincare checkups, makeup applications and recommendations of products. Follow up phone calls and booking appointments to ensure the growth of our business. Team rallies take place several times a day so we can touch base on business trends and where we are in reference to our sales goal. We are also held accountable for opening new charge card accounts, email captures and offering and using our ""Let Us Find It"" system which is a system we can order out of stock product for our customers. I learned many valuable things from the Estée Lauder brand and my co-workers such as techniques, product knowledge and exceptional customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and helping them look and feel better about them selves. I enjoy utilizing my empathy skills to better serve our clients. Our management at Carson Pirie Scott helps us strategize to achieve our sales goal although ultimately it is up to us to deliver. The hardest part of the job would have to be the scheduling."
good,"Bonton is a nice place to work, your typical retail environment. The staff were fun and great to work with. However, there are many miscommunication with Human Resources."
good,"Loved assisting customers and providing excellent customer satisfaction. This is a team oriented environment. Some duties performed were balancing register systems and the begining and ending of each shift, providing guidance to customers regarding merchandise and sales."
good,"I enjoyed selling fine jewelry at this store. In a typical day I would scan in and put out new shipments of jewelry, provide customer service to customers that came over to my department, answer phone calls, process and ship repairs weekly. I learned the names of different stones in the jewelry we sold, types of metals that made up the jewelry, how to change watch batteries and take links out of watches, check our inventory. Everyone I worked with in my department was pleasant and professional. They made my job enjoyable."
good,"Opportunities for growth and advancement in many teams, Lots of visibility to upper management, Less bureaucracy than national companies typically see"
good,"A good job, however, when it comes to advancing it is difficult. I got offered an opportunity to start training as a manager after working there for almost four years come this September. Which I took as an opportunity for advancement, and I did not end up getting this position. It was still a good experience. I love this job, however, part-time is not cutting it anymore."
good,"not exactly skilled work, didn't learn much. Management wasn't terrible, did the best they could with the changing e-commerce process."
good,"Typical work day consist of making phone calls, recruiting new customers, cleaning counters and testers, and organizing products."
good,Balance registers.  Work with associates and customers.  Handle complaints or any issues that come up.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be clock in, open/log in my cash register, clean up the customer service area, look around in my area to see if anything is misplaced and if there is, then put them where they belong, stock the racks, clean out the fitting rooms, put returned things away. I learned how to use a cash register and learned how to work with customers. My co-workers were nice and helpful. Sometimes the hardest part of the job was to help find exactly what the customer wanted. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people out."
good,"Making sure your work place is clean and fully stocked,"
good,A typical day consist of helping customers finding their merchandise and ringing up their orders.
good,A warehouse type setting where you are left alone with your work and you are responsible for your own pace and left to utilize your problem solving skills to fill orders.
good,Shopping for the business woman and man with an eye on quality.
good,If You're starting off as an Merchandise Assistant there's not much room for advancement unless you're here for 2+ years.
good,"Performed clerical end of Human Resources. I interviewed people for open positions, made suggestions to the HR manager for hiring. Coordinated applicant orientations, affiliate screening, and expedited new employee data, maintained associate files, compiled benefit related materials, responsible for employee scheduling and payroll, and public relations with co-workers and customers."
good,I enjoyed working here for a few months in-between semester at college.  I was nice because I love customer service
good,"Smaller IT organization than some companies allows you to utilize and develop skills outside of your job area."
good,"At work I usually worked at a register. When it was slow I would work on organizing clothing racks and cleaning out fitting rooms. Occasionally I would come in before the store opened and help with shipment. My co-workers and management were always very friendly. Carson's is a big store, it was hard to get to know everyone you worked with."
good,It was a good company to work for. I left for a better opportunity. I cannot provide an accurate review due to the time length since I have left. I do remember that my supervisor did not want me to leave but could not match what the new company was offering me.
good,"Running background checks, creating leads in LP software on dishonest associates."
good,Quick and easy check out with the biggest savings. Assist in finding the perfect purchase for the holidays.
good,Wish the company could have found a way to stay in business. The Macy's in our area closed and we moved to their location and were able to stay open for 2 more years.
good,"Bon-Ton Store was an okay place to work, because of the customers that became loyal to me. The employee were friendly and fun to work with. The only things that were disappointing for me was the low wages."
good,"Although BonTon experienced a national liquidation event, I am grateful to all associates and management teams for the tremendous learning experience and skills I have gained with my time there"
good,"Was a good place to work when I was in high school getting hours here and there, money was okay for a high school students living with their parents if you are trying to rent/buy a house don’t waste your time here"
good,I loyally worked for company for close to 15 years. The company no longer exists due to being auctioned and liquidation. My role with the company was as Loss Prevention and Safety Manager.
good,"The culture was good, with sufficient work/life balance. High visibility to executive team, and plenty of room for advancement.  The corporate operations were unfortunately shut down, and the company assets liquidated."
good,It was very fast paced on busy days and usually only had one other person helping and they wouldn’t help. Other than that my manager was super sweet and there was always something to do when not busy.
good,"Unfortunately The Bon-Ton Stores Inc. went bankrupt and out of business this month so this rating and review is not applicable.  I enjoyed my time at Bon-Ton's corporate office, and am sad to have to go."
good,"Working at Bon-Ton was a very fun experience. The people that worked there were so amazing and kind. The management was understanding and very considerate about what home life was like. Although they were fun, everything was stressed to be in order"
good,"As the store is currently in the process of closing most of my responses are irrelevant, however, being new to retirement I enjoyed my time at Boston Store, there was a real team effort applied on a day to day basis. This was a perfect choice for a retiree.  I would not recommend this job to someone that had to support a household."
good,"Great job with minimal oversight, I was able to make independant decisions about priorities, set my schedule, and ensure all stores got prompt service."
good,"It's a fast paced environment with ups and downs.  "
good,I had a lot of fun folding clothes.  Men would come to me and say that they wish their wife could fold like me.  Help customers find the price of items.  .
good,All you do is pack boxes unless you're assigned and trained in other parts of the warehouse. Management keeps you informed on any issues with company finances that you see on the news.
good,"They are willing to work with you on your work schedule, with appointments, etc. The managers are nice there and the work is easy enough. There is always something there to do by sides waiting on customers. You can straighten the shelves, pick up product from the floor."
good,"This was a great place to work.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and would go back and do it all over again!  The pay wasn't great where I worked, in E-Comm, as it was all incentive-based.  However, the people were fantastic, Black Friday was a beast, and you were guaranteed to lose at least 15 pounds during the holiday season. lol  Work here, you will like it."
good,"On a typical day, I would make sure the sales floor was neat and stocked, as well as assisting (sometimes) hundreds of customers with finding and purchasing what they needed."
good,Long hours and very hot . You will get burnt and a lot of heavy lifting . Very good pay tho and a lot of raises . Very easy to make a lot of money here
good,The job was easy enough but some days it was very slow and the days dragged on. I would recommend this job to friends and family but ONLY for a first job. The pay is not good and is not a full time job. I am grateful to have the experience they gave.
good,Low key atmosphere... Very professional....They had high energy when greeting customers and were very easy to work with the co-workers it was great except for the hours
good,"I haven't worked here long but the pay sucks for everything they require you to do. No experience start pay is $7.50...Mcdonald's pays more!! But you have to put away truck for your assigned area, keep it all straightened, while also going around  greeting and talking/helping customers, do returns, process payments, try to get new charges, try to get LUFI's, cover other department breaks, set sales and all that. Trying to schedule anything is hard because they do weekly schedules so days and times switch everytime. Vie worked until 10pm close and had to open next day at 8:45. "
good,"I worked for this company for along time before they moved their distribution center out of the area. I enjoyed going to work everyday. Typical up & down with management, but that is everywhere. People who worked here usually stayed for along time. Work was not unbearable here enjoyed my job and the people I worked with."
good,The store is was a great place to shop and the people were friendly.  I learned a lot from managers and the people I worked with since I had to learn every dept. in the store.  Management was hard to work for but I enjoyed helping my customers.  The best part of each work day was when I went home.
good,I liked my job here and would like the same type of work somewhere else .I  learned a lot about packing and production and would like to continue to work in this area.
good,"The ability to work flexible hours in a non-stop environment.  Communication skills while interacting with customers, co-workers and management.  "
good,"I learned how to open and close down the cashregisters, how to look up the inventory in the warehouse. I like the people I work with their all pretty nice and dont stand around like some people do at jobs. I also like that you are around people and you meet new people constantly."
good,"Great people, great managers to work with.... Loved my team...... Some people are really hard working...."
good,Excellent part time Job. Learn many aspects of the job. Fast pace but fun. Gave you an opportunity to grow in your job and make decision. Hardest part of the job was Holidays and hours plus making customers happy. Best part was helping a customer create a new look.
good,I loved the people that I worked with! We had the best group of managers. It is really sad that the company went bankrupt because I am going to miss working with my co-workers.
good,Was able to manage my service calls and work with the stores on site and remotely.  Also was able to work on corporate events at several locations including golf events.
good,"In its prime, Carson's was a great place to work with a fantastic culture. Focus was always on customer service and quality merchandise. Many long tenured dedicated people throughout the company."
good,"Loading in new merchandise, restocking, and reorganizing merchandise.The hardest part about the job was waking up at 4 or 5 in the morning. The people were the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"It gives me a time to talk to people and learn how their day is going and if it not so good, a time to encourage someone to just to brighten up their day sometime I feel like I get all the difficult calls and most of the time by the time that I am done talking with them they are ok"
good,"I learned a great deal in 10 years of employment and my coworkers were helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. Sadly the company has been auctioned for liquidation in bankruptcy court."
good,"I worked with the company for over 30 years, enjoying most of it. However, the company entered bankruptcy in 2018, was eventually sold to creditors and will be shuttered Summer 2018."
good,"THe Bon-Ton Stores, Inc is closing.  We are currently going through a liquidation process and every associate will lose their jobs within the season. Nothing more to review"
good,Bon Ton was a nice place to work. Lots of support from management.  Freedom to be a true entrepreneur and run your business. Large breadth of responsibility.
good,"Bankruptcy, being liquidated currently.  It was not the best place to work, but there were some great people here that i will never forget.  It is a shame it is coming to an end."
good,The team at Bonton was welcoming and helpful. We all got along and respected each other. We are all heartbroken at the store closing and losing such a winning team.
good,"pretty much like any other job, good hours most weekends off , decent pay, nice location, good workmates, nice benefits, comfortable work areas , kind of loud in spots"
good,It was a great place to work at i would do it again if i had a chance. Met some great people that i worked with . It was nice to interact with other people.
good,"Enjoyable, able to showcase my skills, develop professionally and creatively. Local management exceptional, corporate culture indecisive. Lack of stability leads me to current search."
good,"If you want to climb the ladder, Bon Ton will encourage you, that is if you can survive the very LOW pay."
good,"Mostly inside work, clean and good work conditions. Get to meet and work with many friendly co-workers, specially during the holiday seasons,"
good,"I set up displays, handled customer complaints, answered any sales questions customers had for me. Many rewards offered for good sales and customer satisfaction"
good,Good company to work for but there is very little room to advance. Good management and flexible hours. You will get cross trained in different areas so you will learn a lot.
good,"Restocking from day before to make store is presentable before opening.  Morning meeting to deliver information to all associates as to what is to be expected for the day and any news from Corporate.  Management is willing to work with and listen to all associates).  As with anywhere, there is always one or two out the group that think they are the owners of the store, but everyone is on the same page when it comes to team work. Not having a consistent schedule is the hardest part, but its retail.  The most enjoyable part is returning customers asking for you or just wanting to say 'Hi' when they are in the area."
good,"There is a job for all ages to learn and work in the retail environment."
good,"Bon Ton is a great place to work. There is plenty of room for advancement. The compensation is not the best, but the experience has been very expansive."
good,I found the people at the Bon Ton are easy to work with and that there is a good life/work balance.  There isn't always clear direction from Corporate and that can be frustrating.The benefits were good and the salary was fair for the market.
good,A nice company to work for. I learned a lot about Prevage wich is a main sell for Elizabeth Arden i liked the product and enjoyed introducing new people to it.
good,"High energy, fast pace. "
good,"This was my first job! I learned a lot about how to handle customers and money. I also learned a lot of little tricks and hints about clothing, fitting, and shopping!"
good,"I enjoyed my job at the Bon Ton. I advanced numerous times within the almost 7 years I was there, I was a very diverse associate who could help in every department. I enjoyed the constant changing of departments and the fast paced environment. I had the up-most respect for my managers and co-workers, they taught me and helped me grow within that company at such a rapid pace. The hardest part of my job were the inconsistent hours...and even then I didn't really mind."
good,The workplace was good for a start off job. The benefits that came with the job was not that good
good,I retired from Bon-Ton after 25 years and during that time I advanced from a lead to Supervision. I enjoyed my job as the Supervisor of the clerical department in the Return to Vendor dept. The workplace culture overall was very good.
good,"Every day was different, more reports to process accounts to reconcile,  and staff member to assist. The staff were polite and always willing to help."
good,It eas a fun but serious place to work for. I have learned alot of skills from there.  I was there for 9 yrs and still would have kept going if it wasnt for it closing down. I love the ideal of learning from managers who knew it was time for me too advance. Bon ton became my family and i really miss the people who worked for me and with me. I am a people person and always helping others. My attendance was perfect in 9 yrs. I also did paperwork in human resource when needed. Answer phones etc
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with on a daily basis. It was an extremely fast paced, hectic environment and without the friendly collaboration of your co-workers, it would have been very difficult to do each day."
good,The job gave me more experience in customer service and more information on a different software. I work with all types of people and the environment is very friendly.
good,"It was a good enough job, it had a calm atmosphere compared to other cashing jobs and there was always something to do. However, you only made minimum wage, maybe a few cents more, and there really wasn't much to be had in the way of promotions"
good,The Bon-Ton was a wonderful place to work.  The company was very positive in training employees and helping them to learn all aspects of retail.  The most enjoyable part of my job was to assist customers.  I was also fortunate enough to help train other employees. I feel I was able to grow tremendously in my supervisor position due to the wonderful leadership of our store manager.  She believed in me and allowed me to grow at the rate I was comfortable at.
good,was left to do my job.  the people were great.  my boss was the best boss I have ever had.  I was in charge of the telephone equipment at  262 stores and 3 corporate offices. was on call every other week.
good,"Depending on the position held, it was fast paced / deadlines, but yet with a relaxed atmosphere.  Good people and culture.  Decent benefits and discount."
good,No further feedback since the company is liquidating; however while working there- it was a good environment that was trying to offer growth and opportunities for the company
good,"The management with this company is great for working with me while going to school. They are very understanding about needing time to study. Around the holidays you can get more hours in, day or night, as long as there is a manager there."
good,I worked in the fragrance and cosmetics area. All my co workers took me in as one of their girls. We had competition between our different counters. At times it was slow paced but other times it was fast paced. Having to work with 3-5 customers at once and it was not only at one counter it was at 6 different ones. I would love to stay at this place but sadly it is closing.
good,"A sales associate's compensation is partially constricted by store traffic. When traffic is light there is little opportunity to make a sale and when there are no promotions running you can go in the hole and owe Carson's money on your draw. The most successful sales people have returning clients to bolster their number of Ups. (With an Up system, sales people take turns helping customers by signing up on a list when they are available to work with customers.)"
good,"There is no typical day at work here! Be ready to switch gears at any moment. Associates who thrive in a fast paced environment will do well here. The company culture is friendly, many people have worked there for 20+ years. Most enjoyable is that no two days are the same, so you are never bored. Hardest part is the job has no ending point, it is continual."
good,"When I was employed at Bon-Ton, I was quickly able to advance in my role, and transfer to another department within the company, in order to continue my growth."
good,"Call Center Customer ordering and Customer care."
good,"I only worked here for a few months. It was okay. The managers were nice but also not much help. They weren't very interactive with their workers and the relationship we had felt very impersonal compared to my other jobs.  Fellow employees there also weren't the best at times, but they could have been worse."
good,Great coworkers always willing to help out. Managers were fair and always available when needed. I got to learn many aspects of retail and operations.
good,ok job if you still live with parents but not for someone who has bills to pay. Very busy during the holidays fun work place.
good,Drama makes up majority of each day. But it gets easier to manage the less you care about the drama and the more you care about making your money and going home.
good,"This is a retail business setting which supplies high end clothing, shoes and housewares and cosmetics to customers in Midland and it's surrounding area."
good,very slow and never that busy. it was only a matter time before the store closed. Job advancement was not easy. Never enough staff on the floor due to not enough hours given to cover all work areas.
good,"The store was very clean and well merchandised. The atmosphere was nice, but very busy. Duties included folding and stocking merchandise. Customer service and all financial transactions. Trained for multiple departments which was difficult at first, but the experience was good."
good,I removed defective material from trucks that was returned from stores. Once the truck was clean I sorted through the material and returned it to its designated area.
good,"The training and experiences I received while at The Bon Ton provided me with a great perspective on the way the business world works.  "
good,"The job has an excellent work environment. You put the customers first and attend to them before the other tasks associated with your job. I learned how to run the registers, be polite, and work with an excellent group of people. The management was strict and expected a lot of you. My co-workers are great and communicate well with you. The hardest part of my job was the expectations that the managers put on you. The most enjoyable part of my job is the satisfied customers that go through the store."
good,"Unloading trailers and processing new merchandise. "
good,Meeting the customers needs. Provide and give great customer service.
good,"If I didn't have to quit I wouldn't of, really great store, weak on the management but I am actively trying to get back it was that great."
good,"Working in shipping and receiving is physically demanding, very fast paced work but a fun job if you like to stay very busy and work hard. Your work day begins at 5am and you continue until the truck is completely processed, this can be anywhere between 8:30am and 2:00 pm depending on the size of the truck. I believe the work day is very similar between locations but at this particular store your day begins with unloading the trailer by placing each box in it's department location on the loading dock. Some departments are opened immediately and prepared for the sales floor and others are opened later. After the truck is empty you will open each department one at a time and prepare merchandise for the sales floor (take merchandise out of box, hang it on bars, take it out of plastic bags and place on a rolling rack to be delivered to the correct department)  This is done in an assembly line type of order. You typically have one job every day, open boxes, remove and hang clothing, remove plastic from hanging garments, or attaching security tags) Once all merchandise is prepared, tagged (security tags) and placed in the correct department your day is done. There is a chance you could be offered extra hours if you can work evenings and/or weekends assisting the management and sales team with getting supplies, collecting hangers from service centers, setting up or removing fixtures on the sales floor. This is VERY fast paced. There is some heavy lifting but nothing too bad,(except the fixtures, some of them are very heavy) you will get a workout in this position! It involves a lot"
good,Flexible hours
good,"Although the job sometimes felt repetitive, the ability to balance work and life was very easy to maintain."
good,I loved this job. I worked with great people. The management was friendly but knew where to draw the line. I loved doing makeup artistry here as well as selling.
good,Bon-Ton was a fun place to work but did not have many opportunities to climb the corporate ladder. I worked there while it was going out of business so that may be the cause.
good,I worked for this company for almost 20 yrs. I Have always had great experiences in learning new challenges. I started as a seasonal associate and work my way up through several different  titles witnin the company.
good,"Nice place to work but had its share of customer complaints. Management was nice but they changed frequently, so had to get used to the new way of doing stuff."
good,"No longer is business, closed due to bankruptcy.  No other review is necessary.  Was a good company to work for.  Offered good benefits until the closure."
good,I enjoyed working here. I meet several people in my new community. Most people I worked with were nice and we all worked well together. There's always that one person who kills the atmosphere.
good,"The management staff listened to the sales associates and took their ideas into consideration when making visual adjacency moves. "
good,"Great culture from a flexibility standpoint and dress code requirement.  Would've loved more technical, job-related training.  My co-workers were fantastic -- many of them having been with the company 20+ years.  My direct-line management was also great - receptive to feedback and very supportive."
good,There’s always something to do and the managers and coworkers  are always willing to help. Friendly environment and the company’s mission is valued and followed.
good,"ambiance familiale"
good,"I cant say much. a typical day would go by pretty fast, it was stressful having to bend over all day picking up the same piece of clothing because itd always get knocked down for some reason. Although I enjoyed coming to work simply because of the super sweet old ladies we'd get on Sunday's."
good,"Good company to work for.  Enjoyed customers  and associates . Lots of changes , hard to keep up with all. "
good,"I felt the Store manage had anger issues and would take some things out on others, namely employees. "
good,Very good management!!  Flexible work hours.  Store discount is fabulous.  Manager Pat Hull is outstanding.  The only negative thing I can say is about the amount of new credit card account they expect people to get.   This specific store I worked in is in a small town.
good,I enjoyed working at BonTon. I learned a lot during my time there. It is a fast paced environment with a lot of collaborative interaction between departments.
good,"Bonton was  friendly place to work has a busy atmosphere, lots of pleasant people to work with had a decent steady crowd of regular customers I always had something to do"
good,I learned a lot in retail here at Bon ton. The store was clean and friendly ! The hours I was promised did not work out and I needed more full time !!
good,Work here is good. You can advance quickly if you put your nose to the grindstone. Everyone is working to make the business better. There are some great employee discounts.The different committees try to host various employee events which provides a nice break sometimes. Best part of the job is the people you work with.
good,Great store to work for.  The people were great that I worked for and the customers were always nice.  The culture is always upbeat.  They always like input from their employees.
good,"This job is both demanding physically and mentally, but I loved every minute of it. I loved being able hire and train a new associate into a management position."
good,I love working with the customers. They make the day so great. I also love my co workers. I like that we all work as a team. There isn't really anything hard about the job except that hours are cut so all of the jobs that need done fall onto the ones that are working. I want this as a second job and I'm hoping I find something more secure for my main job.
good,"Greeted customers face to face with a smile to assist with locating and selecting merchandise in a friendly and courteous manner.  "
good,"After two years of experience at Bon-Ton, I will say my experience was a great learning experience, but growth was difficult to accomplish. I liked my boss very much, and my co-workers, but after two years of excelling at my job, I wasn't given an option to grow in the company. Overall, I will say my experience was good. My reasons for leaving the company had nothing to do with my experience there."
good,"As a sales associate you manager your area of work by help customers find the right thing their looking for either in clothing, cookware, bedding, or bath supplies."
good,"I enjoyed working at Herberger's mostly because of my coworkers and managers.  They were highly intelligent, friendly and always helpful."
good,Productive and meaningful place to work.    Customers and customer service are a priority with the company.   The most enjoyable parts of my job are demonstrating and educating customers on products including both the short and long term benefits of the items and building loyal customers.  I work with a solid team of colleagues who share the same goals.
good,Great company to work for.  Excel to job/career improvement and consistent opportunities to succeed and grow within the company with new job expectations and daily challenges.
good,Easiest part of the job is to communicate with the customers. I love to talk and also to listen to their needs and see if I can fulfill their needs. Personal goals are to be met. The management could be better and needs more follow through on ideas. The company needs to advertise better and learn that the Furniture Gallery is different than the department store. They need to take our feedback and not just ignore it and just look at the numbers. The most frustrating part of my job is the advertising or lack their of. I advertise for my self through social media.
good,"Busy with customer service issues"
good,a normal retail day. customer service -on phone and sales floor. learning to handle people like most places you work. management was ok. good atmosphere of co-workers.
good,"always busy and a great environment to work in. great management, someone is there when you need them."
good,"Enterd Purchased Orders in the computer. Created style numbers, sku numbers and had items distributed to each store. Created price changes and worked with buyers answering questions. Everyone was fiendly and easy to work for. The hardest part of the job was creating styles, purchase orders and having them distributed to each store at very last minute."
good,"The responsibilities were making sure all the cashiers were taking care of the customers. Getting change for all the cashiers. the end of the day balancing out everything. So days the job had long hours, but it was a very busy job."
good,Successfully managed seven sales associated while also achieving my personal sales goals. Also prepared books and attended monthly meetings for one million dollar inventory.
good,"My day at work consists of waiting on customers, pulling shoes for them, opening credit account, and taking presell orders. I've accumulated many great customer service skills over the years working at The Bonton. I liked all of my co-workers, we all got along well and worked together. The hardest part of my job was trying to satisfy every customer and meeting my sales and credit goals. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing a customer happy with my service and helping them pick out shoes for an outfit."
good,"The Bon-Ton is loyal and fair to their employees. There is abundant opportunity for advancement if that is what you desire. Full-time benefits are generous, and the opportunity to work with the public is one of the job's appeals."
good,Bon Ton Stores was a very fast paced fun environment.  They allowed me to learn new skills and I was promoted several times over my career there.   I worked with cross functional teams on a variety of different applications.
good,Bonton was a very calm environment. The employees were easy to work with and the workflow could get a little crazy but other than that being a shoe sales associate was fun and different.
good,bon-ton was a great store to work  lots of sales going on.very friendly people to work with.  manager was enjoyable to work with.wish the store never had close
good,"The place was good to work at, it is no longer in operation.  Fun, enjoyable people, management good, culture was varied. Nothing was hard about it. Learned lots."
good,"Customer focus was one or our stores to priority."
good,"Bon Ton was an excellent company to work for.  A fast paced environment, and excellent compensation.   Its sad to see them leave the industry.  They were an institution."
good,"Liked the challenge of balancing all funds, finding errors and fixing them in order to balance all store funds. Work schedule was very flexible.  Worked 19 hours or less per week, which was considered short hour employee.  Daily counted all monies taken in at all terminals (29), find any errors in accordance with count, balance the reports and send to district.  The hardest part was sometimes finding the errors committed by associates.  After my manager retired, I was predominantly in charge of the cash office.  I worked with 3 to 4 other associates, who covered on my days off.  We all worked well together, kept each other informed, and assisted each other in regards to the schedule.  I also identified two associates stealing funds from the terminals, which was a part of my job.  The hardest part of the job was working Thanksgiving day, night and black Friday, along with Christmas Eve evening."
good,I have enjoyed working for the Bon Ton. I have gained a lot of management skills  during my 19 years of service. My typical day consisted of prioritizing a to do list to keep me on track but most times there were unforeseen events to prevent me from completing the list. The list was carried into the next day.The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting the customers to the best of my ability. I have gained several regulars that would specifically ask for my assistance  during their shopping excursions. The hardest part of my job was having to reprimand associates for any wrong doings. Although I overcame that by presenting the documentation in a way as helping them as opposed to being critical.
good,"Good company to work for.  It's a shame that it had to file bankruptcy and then liquidate.  However, I expect there will continue to be more of that in retail."
good,Would have stayed there for life if our company didn't fail.  I had a fantastic job and family at the studio and we made beautiful pictures and sold lots of merchandise for the company.
good,"Great place to work.  On call can be tedious, people within the stores and corp are outstanding.  It really is unfortunate upper management had no clue and took this one time great company into bankruptcy."
good,"Very enjoyable working with peers as a team, bringing new ideas to the sales floor making customer and shopping experience more enjoyable."
good,"This company is liquidating. It is going out of business. It will no longer exist in the near future. There will be no Bon-Ton, Boston Store, Carson's, Herberger's and Younkers."
good,A good seasonal position. Boxes come down a conveyer belt. You check it to make sure it has the right store number and then load it onto the truck. You have to be careful to make sure that the boxes don't get damaged during transportation.
good,Bon-Ton provided me several opportunities to advance in my career. I would still be with them if we received a going-concern bid instead of the liquidators.
good,Challenging and fast paced work environment. Provided many opportunities to learn new skills and work on very varied projects. Great culture where teamwork was very valued.
good,"I've had a solid career with Bon-Ton with excellent growth opportunities.  I was able to advance my career in a relatively short period of time based on the circumstances.  I was able to draw on my experience and offer stability to the sourcing, quality and operations side of Private Brand."
good,"The people who work there are nice, but the customers are horrible. You do not get paid that much, and I been working there for a year. Also they give you bad hours, and they always want you to open up a credit. Which is impossible to get cause people already have them or do not want one."
good,"It's a good job, I used to take customer service calls but now I do emails and Amazon customer service. I just wished I was compensated for the extra work I have to do."
good,Great work environment to be in. The people were kind the associate discount were great. Management was great and it was positive environment to work in.
good,Bon Ton has given me so many opportunities for growth and given me training and skills that will help me in the future. My manager and upper management believe in me and have made a point to develop me for the future.
good,"My primary goal was to sell merchandise, and share my product knowledge and product experience with customers.    Then it became my commitment to  provide outstanding customer service. My inspiring ,strong, competitive spirit and hard work brought  me personal growth and satisfaction."
good,"the pay was definitely fair for what i was doing the job wasnt overly stressful but also wasnt so laid back that there was nothing to do, the managers were fair but still enforced the rules."
good,"I enjoyed my job there, as it was flexible and relaxed. I do wish there was more variety in my day to day job duties, as I had the potential to take on a lot more work. I wish training for additional responsibility was available. I worked with some really nice and helpful managers and coworkers, however, there were 3 people that were very cliquey and stand-offish. I felt uncomfortable around them, but fine with everyone else. Also, paying for parking as well as getting in and out is a real pain. But I did enjoy my time there for the most part."
good,"you can just be a cashier or just work on truck. truck would come in every Monday and you would have to load and unload everything, and also put it away."
good,Bon-ton was a very good and interesting place to work the managemts was kind and frenidly and understood if something had come up if your personal life.
good,"- There is a considerable focus on the newest fashion trends"
good,"I enjoyed connecting customers with knowledge based on the products they own. the work environment is great, management prides itself on communication ."
good,"Great company to work for.  A lot of shift work and so was ready to advance in my career and have better opportunity for home balance.  Very fast paced, and a lot of reporting was learned.  The company should do a better job with upgrading all systems so that Microsoft office interface is accessible, and easy to use."
good,"This job I worked there for 22 years, I went from shipping and receiving to HR/OPS manager."
good,"The Co workers were great, Management  was great, Very nice place to work. Easy to advance in.customers were great, We got discounts. Very clean and nice store"
good,BonTon was a nice place to work at. The management was wonderful and the associates were all pleasant. I never had a bad day at BonTon. The only negative criticism I have is the fact that I was never scheduled enough hours per week which is the reason I left in the first place.
good,Working at the bonton was not the job for me. The store itself is never really busy so that always made time go by slow. I prefer a job that I am constantly busy.
good,was amazing i love trendy apparel and using my acute fashion sense to help others being paid to do what i love to do and working with a great management team to achieve store goals
good,My day at work was traveling to different stores to help coach to build sales driven goals. I had to have relationships with store management as well as regional management and counter management. I learned to be very open to the different personalities i worked with and to adjust my coaching style to each.  The hardest part of my job was after i have given the direction of what has to be done I had to learn to walk away and delegate.  The most enjoyable part of my job are the people. I love people and i love building relationships.
good,Something new everyday.  Floor moves were a daily part of the job to keep things fresh and new for customers. Meeting new people everyday.
good,"I loved working here, we answered phones , but overall the company was great"
good,Great place to work with good benefits. The hours can vary greatly and sometimes working full time only offers up to 32 hours per week.
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Parisian was meeting with customers. Many of them became lifelong friends. Parisian is no longer in business.
good,The hardest part of my job is ensuring that over 500+ products are processed accurately and efficiently while resolving issues from many buying offices and other depts and completing daily responsibilities by deadlines. The most enjoyable part of the job is analyzing selling reports and planning sales promotions & creative for the website.
good,I have worked this place for many years.  Employees as well as employers were excellent to work for.  I have had full-time jobs while working here and they were eager to help me.
good,"I worked for a makeup counter. It was a fun job, had to leave due to the birth of my first child and I wanted to be home with her."
good,"Beautiful store, people are very nice, retail is not always the highest paid job, but it's a very nice place to work. It's not too big of a company and not too small, just the right size. The assoicaties are high quality!"
good,"good working environment, great way to meet people and build long term business relationship. Great experience."
good,"Diversity, multitasking, and extensive customer service. Everyday is different. Management is hands on for me as well as customers and associates. I am a team player and we work as a team. Hardest part of the job is leaving on time. Most enjoyable part are when sales and productivity are above expectations."
good,"A typical day at Bon Ton is that priorities are always changing and recognizing these changes are not always structured tasks, but something you learn based on prior days activities and different by department. The skills I learned to be most useful in my job, include movational skills: such a diverse group of employees and what motivates them to do what you ask them to do all differ between what they value and what's in it for them. Also being sympathetic to their needs and their level of understanding and capabilites to get their job done and giving them the resources to get the job done whether it being coaching, training or just understanding the value behind what your asking them to do. The hardest part of the job for me was making sure the tasks got completed when the customer service levels had to be maintained and be the most important goal for everyone. Your employees genuinely what you to succeed and they want to make you happy, but I didn't want them to do it at the expense of customer service. The most enjoyable part of my job was at the end of the day, stepping back and saying ""we did It"" and thanking my employees for a job well done and the customers responding positively to how great our store is."
good,"Une journée de travail typique"
good,"Exceptional mentorship - Open door policy."
good,Challenging work environment where I was able to learn a lot and advance quickly.  Unfortunately due to the Company's financial constraints I was unable to continue with my employment there.
good,"Bonton cared about each and every customer and employee.  The training is in depth and there is always room for advancement and change in the work place.  There is always something to do and new to learn.  They follow strict  rules allowing appropriate lunch times and compensate breaks.  They have daily morning meetings to keep all employees well informed with everything goin on within the company.  It prides itself on being clean, well cultured and a great experience for every customer.  No one is allowed to leave the store unhappy.  It is an amazing company to work for and it is extremely sad that it is going under,"
good,"I've worked in both corporate and studio settings. Corporate life is great, but I really thrive in a less ""stuffy"" environment!"
good,"Bon-Ton was a great place to work, but unfortunately marketing couldn't  compete with online and more aggressive retailers so Bon-Ton is going out of business."
good,Bon-Ton is a great place to be employed.  Working within the team and across teams is very seamless and management is very supportive.  Job responsibilities are always challenging and very enjoyable.  The company has a great work-home balance and is very understanding about that balance.  The only negative thing I can say is the health and retirement benefits could use some work.
good,Very competitive group of associates within the IT department.  I liked my line of work and learned a lot over the years.  The manager gave me challenging things to do.
good,"I enjoyed working here as a first job. I thought it was a good environment to start off in the work force.When i started working at The Bon Ton, I started as a cashier. As a cashier I was responsible for cashing out the customers and put clothes back that ended up at my stations. Our motto at The Bon-Ton is ""customer first"". So no matter what our job title was we were always responsible for putting the needs of our customers first, also. When I came back to The Bon-Ton after leave for several months (due to college), i returned and started a new position in the back. I was responsible for fulfilling shipment orders that came to us, and when we did not have any i was responsible for picking up the store (organizing racks, folding clothes)."
good,"Worked with a small group of people with designated responsibilities that allowed for smooth daily operations.  Because it was in the construction field, the work load fluctuated seasonally.  Because it was a small business, leadership was consistent."
good,"A typical day at work tends to be slow, but the managers and co-workers are easy to work with. The only down fall is they continue to hire new people although not even having enough hours to give to the employees already there."
good,A typical day at work included walking the floor to identify and apprehend shoplifters. Weekly I would run reports to identify dishonest employees. Monthly I would perform both inventory and safety audits to make sure the store was following company procedures safely and efficiently.
good,"Customers and associates make a work day very pleasant. There isn't anything hard about this job, most of it is just common knowledge. What I enjoy most about The Bon Ton is my coworkers."
good,"Company closed down, overall was a good company to work for. If they hadn't closed I'd still be there. Company culture wasn't very diverse and some of the employees were extremely rude but overall I loved my team and position."
good,I really enjoyed my time at Bonton. I learned a lot and the people I worked with were awesome! It is really too bad that the company went bankrupt. I will miss this place.
good,"It was a wonderful,fast paced company.  They offer great incentives as well as being a great learning experience.  i would most certainly enjoy working in this type of company again."
good,"The job itself is a lot of fun. However, there was a lack of communication between managers which could lead to confusion, especially during closings."
good,A typical day would consist of maintaing the cleanliness of your area. You were in charge of checking dressing rooms for your assigned area every hour.
good,I loved working here in the beginning. The people I worked with were nice and focused. Overall it is a well ran company. Only issues are that even with peak season the work load wasn't enough to keep people busy. Outside of peak season they sent people home early.

good,"Assisting customers on the sales floor and registers. Putting out new merchandise. Cleaning/straightening and sale sets. Ordering merchandise, send sales, and pre-sales. Advertising current and upcoming sales. As a sales associate, I've went over and beyond to assist my customers and did what was allowed to give them the best discount and sales experience. Coworkers are very pleasant and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is finding a compromise between making the customer happy and not hurting the company's sales. What I personally enjoyed most is interacting with coworkers and customers."
good,just ok i would say. Management was still figureing things out and it was crazy sometime but we got thru it
good,It was fun work. The workers were cool. The managers were cool. They did lots of things around the holidays. They worked with my days at mt other job.  Just wasnt my line of work.
good,"I worked for Bon-Ton (Boston Store) for 17 years."
good,"This is the same company as Younkers. I workded for Herbergers before transferring stores when I relocated. Very productive place to work, very busy all the time and I liked that a lot. I miss the people most of all. Everyone was usually so friendly and willing to help. There were many loyal customers and each and every one made working there worthwhile. I gained so much valuable experience working there and still use the skills I learned to this day. Management was always very professional and I think that rubbed off on me in all the right ways. Thank you to the team at Stillwater!"

good,"I arrived at least 20 minutes prior to the start of the meeting. Turned the lights on in the furniture department where the meetings were held. "
good,"Learning how to do sales, cashier duties, customer service, etc in the ""The Bon Ton"" store was excellent. I enjoyed working as a team and I enjoyed the team I was working with. I enjoyed greeting customers as they walked in our door with a smile. I walk out on the sales floor to ask customers if they need help looking for anything and let them know that if they can't what they are looking for in our store than we have a service called ""Let Us Find It""."
good,"work days are always different, never know what you will be doing that day. You will have your basic tasks to do then some.,"
good,"The Bon Ton was a nice place to work however getting a raise is very difficult the only thing you are reviewed on is how many credit cards you open a month.  They really do not care if you never miss work , if you follow the dress code, if you work for other people when they call off . The hours at the Bon Ton were terrible they were not even busy on the weekend but they extended their hrs of the store until 10pm and sometimes even 12pm at night. Very hard to work those hours with a family. The more credit cards you open the more hrs you got some people only got 8 hrs a week and other people got as high as 30, seemed unfair how they did the schedule. They did give good employee discounts, after you pass the interview test they will let you apply for a credit card right on the spot and give you 20% off the very first day of work."
good,"Bon Ton is a typical dept store and has many rules, policies and procedures that need to be followed everyday. I love working with numbers so the cash office was a great fit for me. I work alone in the cash office so I don't work with my co-workers a lot. I enjoy this position very much but would like to find a full time job working in the customer service  field were I have my experience."
good,I arrived at work every day to find that the other associate had called off from work. The other co workers were part time but very nice the hardest part of the job was meeting the sales terms for the month. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the customers.
good,Bon-Ton was a good place to work. Associates helped each other and supported each other. They provided and celebrated when associated made strides or attained their goals.
good,Coworkers were great and helpful and helped my Supervisor teach me what i needed fast and efficient. It was hectic at times. Some supervisors acted like they were beneath the work there.

good,"Over the course of my career at BonTon I have worked on several different Private Brands and had the pleasure of working with so many amazing people.  I have developed meaningful relationships with my coworkers throughout the years, but also even more so as BonTon prepares to close their doors.  It is a tough time for BonTon's employees and our friends.  But, it has provided me with a career for the last 10 years and I will take with me the wonderful relationships I have created.  It is time to move forward and onto the next steps in my career."
good,"This is a very competitive environment.  Evaluations of your daily sales, monthly and annual sales are reviewed and critiqued daily by management.  Expectations change daily as a manager because of the unlimited number of promotions created by corporate."

good,"Everyone helps with everything, even if you don't ask. They are always happy to help, and as long as you respect them, they will respect you.

But it's nothing too serious."

good,"When i worked at Bonton I learned how to work the cash register, I also had to memorize where all the items of clothes went. I then had to put all clothes on hangers and then put them back in the right place. The coworkers were great, and very helpful. The hardest part of the job was memorizing where every item was suppose to go, and the most enjoyable part was being able to help customers find the clothes they wanted, along with being able to save them money on their purchases."
good,Personnel et clientèle très agréable avec qui travailler est un plaisir
good,I believe that working with customers was the best part of my day as a salesperson. I learned I really enjoyed pleasing my customers and meeting new co-workers was a plus also.  The hardest part I would say would be when we had slow time and I was caught up on straightening up the merchandise. Good thing we were a busy store and that didn't happen often.  Management was great when they realized that they could rely on you to do your job with little supervision.
good,typical day at work constantly removing clothes out the fitting rooms

good,"Working in Retail is a different creature, but fun. I love working with customers and mentoring associates."
good,"I worked for Bon-Ton 33 years."
good,The Bon Ton was an easy place to work for the most part. However many of my co-workers came to work unwilling to do much of anything. Personally I wanted to keep myself busy and some days there weren't enough customers to keep entirely busy. I filled my days with straightening my section and finding more product in the backroom that I could put out as well as organizing drawers near the cash register and helping out other sections that were in view of my department. My biggest complaint about the Bon Ton is that it didn't really challenge me in anyway. Management was always helpful in providing me tasks when I had finished the ones I could think of myself. They were also very good at leaving me to my tasks without watching over my shoulder and yet were still close by if I needed to ask a question.
good,A typical day at The BonTon is helping ourcustomers with every day sales and products. Introducing new items and promoting new sales. Friendly staff and co-workers.
good,"I wouldn't have stayed for 10 years if I hadn't enjoyed my time there. I learned a lot and strengthened some of the skills I already had. I enjoyed my time there  and the comradery  that we had with fellow supervisors and associates alike. There was always a large turnover in help and the raises given were paltry which have them no incentive to stay. There was always too much focus on opening charges, which put a lot of pressure on associates and supervisors both."
good,It was a nice work place for part time work. No problems ever with other associates. We all helped each other train and answer questions. Good help with tough customers. Good breaks not a lot of hours given to me.
good,"The work atmosphere, co-workers in entire store worked together no matter what department they were from. I was able to improve the negativity in a part of the cosmetics department, by communicating with them, using empathy, and positive words. Very rewarding, and those employees ended up thanking me for making a difference."
good,I operated a stand up reach truck in confined iels removing palettes from shelves and picking items for orders and i would also have to do the same to stock the shelves.
good,"The position at BonTon was enjoyable for the most part.  I was often given projects to work on, which I looked forward to.  I was assigned to one or two  departments, over the course of my employment.  It's important to know the merchandise, where to find it and how to educate the customer about it.  The most difficult part of the job was not having enough time, during a shift, to complete the project that was assigned to me.  I prefer to finish something once it is started.  The most enjoyable aspect of the job was meeting and talking with customers and assisting them in finding the product that they were seeking."
good,Always treat the customer first.  I was amazed how many lonely folks came in because they actually made friends with the employees.  I love helping people  and i found i met some lovely people.
good,"I enjoyed demonstrating the Clarins products to customers and educating customers with their features and benefits as Clarins is a wonderful skin care."

good,Very full days with time that flew by. I loved getting to meet all the new people I would assist. Very much enjoyed this position.

good,"While at Boston Store, I have learned how to strategically embrace change.  That has been and is accomplished because the satellite location in which I am based, is considered a ""Proto-type/Test"" store for small doors within the Company.  Therefore, new thought processes, innovations, and executions are usually implemented within my location.  This is why I love my job because it not only enables me to creatively execute those directives, but it challenges me to expand my thought process as it relates to execution and effective communication."

good,"I started to work their as a floater and then became a full-time worker.   I worked in various departments and learned about various lines of clothing and linens."
good,"A typical day at work varies on the quantity of orders that are received each day.Specifically, my job usually is to make sure all material in order is properly packaged and shipped accordingly to procedure. Everyday at work is a different learning experience. Although my main job is packaging material, I also train new employees for the company. While training other employees their everyday work experience is completely different from mine. As the day goes by while training, I usually learn different techniques on how to do a job differently but still achieve the same goal to finishing the work. Also, every so often I have other experienced employees working with me and also sharing there techniques on how to finish a job rather it may be faster or just easier. Everyday is a different learning experience in some manner. As I was explaining above, my co-workers give me a lot of insight on how different jobs can be done. Being organized and having good communication between my co-workers and I is the key to success. I respect all of my co-workers rather it be a manager, supervisor, or just a typical employee such as myself. Although work is enjoyable, in any work field there is always one thing that seems harder than others when completing task. I would say my hardest task throughout the day for me is Time management. Working for Bonton, it comes with many task. Communication, skill, and being focused, has to be a must for me to make sure all task are finished before my work day ends. We all get tired, restless, and some times really hungry but at the end of the day, my co-workers"
good,I enjoy all of my co-workers. A typical day involves selling to the customers and keeping our departments neat and accessable for the customers.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of working on the cash register which I enjoyed the most, because of the interaction with customers. I learned how to deal with a greater amount of pressure to be efficient due to being hired during the holiday season. I had great co-workers who all work great as a team. The hardest part of being at this job was trying to satisfy each and every customer who ,say have been disappointed when a certain product they wanted was not in-store."
good,"Was a great place to work for but is closed now. "
good,i loved the working at the bonton i learned a lot about working there. Everyone got along i thought. there was nothing hard about the job. I loved everything about the Bonton.

good,"I like this ccompany, I like mostly person in here except with my supervisor, everyone was nice and good to work with, the manager was awesome. I think the place was closed."
good,I had a lot of fun working there. The environment was comfortable for me and my team made sure everyone felt important and looked after. It was a part time job but they did what they could to make sure I had enough hours every week.
good,"It should be noted that most of the Bonton stores were closed at the end of August 2018. The company still operates as an online business. I loved working at the Bonton. They gave me a lot of opportunites to develop new skills. The managers were fair and engaged with the customers and associates. The store itself is badly missed by the community because it provided a wide range of products and services. Both former staff members and shoppers remember the Bonton as a community-focused business, and we miss it."
good,I stayed with bonton for 15 years because they were good to me.   There was ample opportunity for advancement as well as a family friendly environment.
good,I loved my job. It was a always a great place to be. Everyone was always so easy to get along with. Sometimes higher management was a pain to deal with but everyone got over it quickly. Sad to see it go.
good,A great place to work. Unfortunately the company filed bankruptcy chapter 11 and is now closing all the stores for good. It is a sad loss. awesome customers
good,"Excellent and organized atmosphere. I enjoyed assisting the customers and meeting all types of people.  My Manager ran a tight ship but that was why our flagship store was successful.  Today, near the closure of the store, there isn't a day that goes by where each and every customer that I assist is in mourning about the store closure.  We had a strong customer base and the store will truly be missed."
good,"My responsibilities included keeping the department clean and in order, meeting the needs of the customers, ordering items for the customers on line and keeping the fitting room clean and orderly.  I learned how to organize the department and work alongside other associates and how to be flexible in every area of retail.  The hardest part of the job was setting the sale, sometimes every other day and at the same time waiting on the customers.  The most rewarding part of my job was the customers.  Some customers give me a hug every time they come into the store to shop and when they knew the store is going to close they say""Let me know where you are going to work and I'll shop there.  Some will wait in line until I am the one who will be waiting on them.  They will be friends for life.  Some of them have given me their name, address and phone number."
good,"Bon-Ton was a great place to work. The people were friendly and it was a relaxed environment. As long as you made all of your deadlines.

good,"Working at Bon-Ton was definitely fun and I learned a lot there. The only problem was that I was a minor so I had difficulties with them scheduling me past a certain time as I was not legally allowed to drive after 11pm. Other than this, it was a great job with a great work environment. The managers were great, co-workers were helpful and nice. I learned how to work retail from professionals that had been with the company Bon-Ton for a long time and for that I am very thankful."
good,"A typical day at work is working hard...I learned to be a better worker , working with people who been there for years... The hardest part of the job is working with people who doesn't work as hard as u..."
good,Plenty of hours and overtime. The hours were perfect for me.  Clocked in at seven and clocked out at three forty-five.  The work was fast pace which made the day go by quick.

good,A typical day at work would consist of coming in greeting all your co-workers and heading upstairs to where I am suppose to work. Put my stuff in a locker go to where I am suppose to and clock in and if no customers are waiting you would go around a clean things up and straighten things up. Management wasn't so great because you would have to get on the phone and call them over and usually it takes forever for the manager to get to you and then the customer gets mad at you and they may leave. My co-workers were respectful and we got along very well. The hardest part of the job would be busy days and dealing with angry customers. Most enjoyable part of my job was seeing kids laugh and find toys they liked.

good,"Before the end of The Bon-Ton Stores, Inc., it was a great place to learn various aspects of department store advertising and I truly enjoyed Home and Furniture advertising as opposed to Fashion advertising. Even though management changed quite a bit over the years, I enjoyed what I did and contributed. We Art Directors had our specialties regarding type of advertising that we liked and got to do on a regular basis... like I said, I really enjoyed the furniture advertising of the company. I would say the hardest part of the job was at the very beginning when I had to learn very quickly all the steps and the likes/dislikes of buyers, managers, vice presidents and presidents of the company so I could do consistent work. Ultimately, after the first year, I learned to communicate well with everyone and ask the right questions so then I could really get into and enjoy my projects."
