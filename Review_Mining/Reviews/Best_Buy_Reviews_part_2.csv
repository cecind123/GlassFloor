good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I spent a lot of time at Best Buy. I worked in different stores in different cities as well as in a work from home capacity. Working here is what you make of it. As with any other workplace, the team you work with can make a huge difference in whether or not your workday is more enjoyable and that aspect of the job will vary as no team will be the same. However, Best Buy does provide much opportunity for growth and for anyone who's looking for somewhere to start a career in Sales/Customer Service, Management, Warehousing, Mobile or Computer Repair/IT, Best Buy isn't a terrible place for that."
good,"a very busy fast paced job. I learned to deal with different types of people. Management is good. The job requires a lot of walking ,standing and lifting."
good,"The people you work with are wonderful, the managers are very hard on you. They are pushy to meet sales goals and if you don't then your hours get cut."
good,Good first job to get you started. Don't recommend getting into management unless you're willing to dedicate your life to a store. otherwise it is a fun environment.
good,"Best Buy provides several types of retirement and welfare benefits for their employees. Many American employers, like Best Buy, finance health plans for their employees, through which businesses typically pay a significant proportion of their workers' health insurance premiums"
good,I really enjoyed my time at best buy. I normally worked mornings and had a very healthy workplace environment. I learned that the hardest part of the job was working on truck deliveries by yourself.
good,"I enjoyed the job I had, as in providing service to customers and interacting with the other employees, but I felt like their sales goals were ridiculous. There would be a total of two customers in the store on and off for days and you would be expected to make $2,000 in a day. Loved that it was a Minnesota-based company and met the CEO, he was a really nice guy. He cashiered at our store on a Black Friday."
good,"Assisting customers on a daily basis with all their technology and home entertainment needs. Items from TV's, Compluters, phones, appliances and much more."
good,Management is very helpful and supportive. The hardest part about the job is the extensive training required in the beginning. Once that is completed the work environment is very fun and collective.
good,The co workers welcomed me with open arms and taught me the ropes on how to make the job experiences relaxing and swift. Working in the warehouse wasn't bad at all because all we did was stock packages from trucks and make sure enough products are down stocked on the floor.
good,"I prefer at this time to not give a review of any of the items mentioned next to this area. "
good,"working little hours, most co-workers aren't friendly, not the best manager, hard to move up because of favoritism, needs better cleaning, needs better equipment."
good,"Best Buy is a biggest eCommerce and in store market with vivid groups of stuff and the employers are amazing."
good,"required tools and materials are often overlooked causing for inability to complete one's job in a timely manner or up to standards. This is often the case for the store has ""spent it's budget"" if you're on sales you wont encounter these issues. Look for competent attentive managers for they're the key to a succesfull working relationship."
good,Everyone is friendly and productive. It is a great environment for young people who are just starting out. I enjoyed the breaks; were long enough and frequent.
good,i dont know what to write its been another job in a long line of jobs enjoy the people i work with but just over the customers you have to work with in bestbuy
good,"it was a fun and interesting place to work, enjoyed my time with the company. i learned alot about the way sales numbers worked. great people who taught me alot"
good,"I spent only but six months with Best Buy. My time there was very pleasant. I was treated well and enjoyed the atmosphere. Had I not moved away for a bit, I would have not left."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy is a good place to work, environment is good, they have a lot of elearnings that help with daily tasks and how to handle situations. you learn a lot and is fun to help other people with their needs"
good,"In asset protection, I was threatened, and insulted, but that is because it was security. In any other time that I didn't have people stealing, it was great!"
good,Management was very bad when I was there. Luckily he is no longer there and I’ve heard it’s gotten better since then. Working warehouse was good because there wasn’t much interactions needed.
good,"a sense of pride working there but for a part-time job, the work was too consuming. There were only a couple of people working in a department so not a lot of help."
good,"a lovely place to work at and make friends, high team spirit. Salesmen are not commissioned which make them focus on customer service. Yet some salesmen don't care too much for exerting more effort."
good,Best Buy is great to work at but I wouldn't consider it the type of place to build a career. Customers are rude and generally don't know what they want even when they ask for it.
good,Good starting point for people but doesn't pay enough once you have been there for a while. They change their bonus structure a lot and it usually goes down. Decent benefits. The don't offer much of career advancements unless you want to go into sales management.
good,"great placed to work "
good,"None"
good,"I truly enjoy working for Best Buy. It has been one of the best place I've worked at and have always built a family within the stores that I have worked for. The only issue that I have been experiencing as of late is trying to transfer to a new location after relocating to a different state. I have been applying and interviewing for 2 months and still have not been able to secure a spot. I would love to stay with the company, but going through this makes it seem impossible at this point."
good,I was a cashier. I enjoyed communicating with customers and having the opportunity to enlighten a person's day in a few minutes at checkout. Many customers have told me that they looked forward to seeing me during their next visit.
good,"review sales targets for the day based on your performance the previous scheduled work day"
good,The company has great benefits for their employees. I really did enjoy working for the company. They had no problem giving you a shot to reach a higher postion!
good,"The company best buy as a whole is okay to work within. But Geek Squad is its own sub-community within Best Buy and with that it comes with its own culture. Job is fun and can be stressful at times due to the fact clients dont come to your counter for good reasons, but are generally stressed out due to the fact they have an issue they need your help with. most clients are friendly but some can be quite rude. If you enjoy problem solving and are tech savvy it is a fun job."
good,"My typical day at work was cool, fast loving family atmosphere in my department. I worked in mobile but the environment was cool calm collect.  I could go back if I chose to."
good,great place to work if you like to be hands on with the latest tech. they provide world class training. there are many options for advancement throughout the company
good,"Very good job to work. If you have the patience for angry customers, then you will do well in this place of business. you might not agree with the pay rate but, the discount will definitely make up for it"
good,"Pros"
good,"Best Buy can be a fun job if you like technology and can handle the rigors of retail.  I worked in the warehouse unloading trucks and stocking shelves, typically when the store closed so I had minimal customer interaction."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best buy was a great place to work for anyone you like electronics. there are days when companies will come and present new tech and give free merchandise.
good,Sold and repaired computer's on a daily basis. Interacted with customer and sold protection packages as well as any needed hardware or software based off of the customers needs. Filed in for management when management was either gone for the day or at a meetings
good,"typical day is understaffed and busy"
good,"The Best Buy I work at does pay me a fair wage. There is a lot of weird politics that go on inside the store and I would say the managers are for the most part, unprofessional. The culture of the people that work there is nice. There is not much room for advancement."
good,"The field agent positions are tricky."
good,"Best buy is a good employer. The benefits, including insurance, RPP contributions, and staff discount are great but the salary feels lower than it should for the expertise required for some tasks. A typical day at work is helping customers, selling warranties, and cleaning and merchandising. Very good management but it is completely dependant on the individual store. Best part of the job is the benefits, the worst part of the job comes from general retail woes such as unfriendly clients."
good,"Depending on the time of week and day, it could be really slow or really busy.  Overall the atmosphere was fun and competitive.  The benefits were very good and the management was decent."
good,"I was a tv salesman, all I did was go over reviews of the item and let them make the decision. Managers were ok, they really like it better if you are independent in your decisions, and able to make final decisions without them."
good,"The company it self is nice and managed correctly depending on your store team, not every store is run the same way and to move up can be a major challenge as many position that maybe open in your store is fought over and managers may have favorites. Pushing and showing your willing to move up is a big thing at best buy so if your quiet and ok were you are then cool but dont expect to be promoted, The benefits are nice when it come down to employees buying stuff but once again to expect big cuts on top shelf items. if you want to have a good time and a relax day just do good with the head of the store and the department lead they will be the people to cover your back and some what help you move up."
good,If you can play the numbers game its a great place to work. Under performers dream hit your number 1 out of 3 months and you're in. kinda sucks for those over achievers who produce every month.
good,"It is a great Job especially for any college students and tech lovers, if you are a nerd you get to be a nerd all day. I don't know about it as a Career though."
good,I was a stock associate and had the pleasure of working in the store after hours stock new merchandise and unloading truck with a hard working and dedicated group of individuals.
good,"Fun tech retail job with flexability of scheduling and opportunity to cross train. Relatively low stress. Typical retail with quota, upselling, delivery and service scheduling."
good,it wasnt as bad staff was friendly business was busy which is good Over all pros are just the hours per week and the students program. cons would just be how certain managers perform
good,Co workers are great but very little advancement and benefits aren't the best if your part time. overall great company to work for and discounts are good
good,My duties are fairly clear in this part-time role. Management is cooperative and flexible. Most employees are helpful and buy in to the teaming concept to attain overall success.
good,Great sales training that has helped in other business and personal ventures. The sales experience helped me be able to talk to individuals. The product knowledge I received was tremendous.
good,This was my first job. I am so happy I got the opportunity to work in sales at Best Buy starting at age 16. It helped make me into the person I am today.
good,a good place to work to get your feet wet in a non-competitive sales based environment. it is a team based environment with no commission based sales creating an easy going work day.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"It’s fun, you get to know new people and make connections with them. Flexible hours and good pay but sometimes you get little hours on the week. Bi weekly pay."
good,Great place to work!  Hard work is rewarded and management promotes a healthy team culture.  Started as seasonal and was promoted very quickly based on individual skill set.
good,"Fun place to grow. Grew in technology, social skills, teamwork, management, and customer service. I started as a seasonal cashier and worked my way into management with Geek Squad. The hardest and most difficult part of the job is the customers. You never felt better then successfully resolving a client issue. The toughest situations are the irrational clients, or the nice ones that you cannot help."
good,The company does not value employees who choose to stay in Operations/Customer Service Representatives positions. The pay rate is not comparable to other companies ( i.e. Hobby lobby is starting at 15.00)  for the same job. These positions are critical to the smooth running of the store but morale tends to be VERY LOW because they are not recognized equally to sales staff.
good,Perfect for students who wish to work part-time while continuing their studies. Working as a Customer Ambassador is a great experience as you interact with the public a lot.
good,Great job to grow selling strategies and communication skills. Sales targets are realistic and the environment is always energetic. The Employee discount is also pretty sweet.
good,"When I worked at the store in Mira Mesa, California I loved all the workers, I love the job we did there, I loved everyone's willingness to help out, I loved all my managers, and I loved the consistency of policy."
good,"Best Buy is a pretty easy going company to work for. Of course in any retail environment there will be undesirable hours, irritating customers, and other challenges to overcome. I would defintiely not apply if you have issues standing for 4+ hours at at time. Your back and feet will hurt during the entire shift, but it's definitely easy money. The people are fantastic, and usually willing to help out if you need a shift covered."
good,"Best Buy can be a fun place to work with the right management team. However, retail hours get old over time. Mostly nights and week-ends, plus open everyday except Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas."
good,"Overall a great place to work, I was there for over 15 years. Career advancement seems to be a bit more based on who you know vs. what you know. It is also hard as management to make a decision regarding an employee in need of corrective action due to HR being overly concerned about lawsuits. "
good,Best Buy is a great place to work! It’s a face paced environment and a fun place to go and be part of a team! Always room for advancement and just a positive experience all around!
good,Excellent place to work if you are interested in new and upcoming technology. It was always a pleasure to have fun while being the best (as is their working motto).
good,"I started working there as a cashier and cross trained into the customer service department. You need to have excellent people skills and able to manage time effectively. I enjoyed interacting with all the different customers. However, they do push you to sell credit cards and magazines, which was less enjoyable for me. While I was good at it, I didn't like the amount of pressure they put on people to succeed at this."
good,Good starter company for those wanting to make the transition into sales in the future. A lot of personal and work development programs as well as awesome health coverage and benefits.
good,"daily i installed all things car audio related and car security related.i learned all about all types of wiring and wire troubleshooting. the work culture was wonderful for most of the management to employee levels and fun on the employee levels, hardest part of the job was newer vehicles becoming more and more data controlled and learning how to adapt current or old technology to new technology"
good,"They paid a reasonable amount for what you'll be doing, it's a nice workplace that doesn't have very much pressure associated with it. There aren't any sales goals as long as you promote what they ask"
good,"Generally good place to work. Sad I was let go due to what I was told was we couldn't afford to keep me hired. But managers were usually great to work with and I never had a problem with anyone. Good place to work, just make your sales targets and you'll be fine."
good,It was a very nice place to work and  gain some experience with them and understand what the customers need. Also learning about what all makes everything work.
good,working here was okay. i didnt mind working the front lanes. however i did not like working at the customer service counter. all in all it was solid employment
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Great starting job and great employee discount. It got me where I wanted to go and got me by month to month. They also give you medical, dental, 401K, etc. if you're full time. Management really doesn't care about you though, only cares about their bonuses."
good,"great place to work, with good coworkers"
good,Bestbuy is a great place to work if you’re willing to keep your opinion to yourself . There is not much room for leadership there unless you are a follower. Bestbuy needs to show more concern for their employees.
good,"the job environment is great, the pay is great, and work is great. but best buy management is horrible no matter the store. there is no way to advance with the company as far as manage positions go. The management team for some best buy teams are also shady as well too. They also have a great tendency for working the employees and disciplining their employees like they are commission based when they are not."
good,Best buy was my first job and loved everything about working at best buy . My English was not as good when i started working there and i started as cashier and worked my self up and became a lead and to a point to even train the new employees .  I definitely recommend working at best buy .
good,Best Buy is a great place to work I was a supervisor and i loved my people and we had a blast being the best. I also worked for Geek squad. I loved the experience.
good,"I worked there for about 6 years and it was very flexible with school, great pay, and pretty fun. The only issue would be that as of recently it became more thinned out with labor."
good,On a typical working truck day we're understaffed so it causes us to be overworked and stressed by the end of the day. Management's attitude of the situation is no matter what the job needs to be completed.
good,Great work and development options for those who like a fast paced and rewarding working environment . Lots of opportunities to move up in the company and great benefits.
good,Best Buy is one of the best companies I have worked for with plenty of room for opportunities and growth. The general manager I worked under for treated his employees with respect and integrity and compensated his employees well with outside work activities.
good,Had fun with fellow coworkers in a day paced environment full of daily challenges. Some of management can be difficult to work with to promote department progress. but overall was a good learning experience.
good,"I worked in the warehouse so my job did not rely heavily on my interactions with the customer so it was relatively simple, though i did see how it stressed my coworkers. Many people wanted to switch to my department because of the pay, manager, and how simple it could be in comparison."
good,"it was really fun working at best buy, the staff was very nice and helping. We had a basketball net setup in the back so on breaks we could play ball."
good,"Assisting customers in store with computer issues and software installations."
good,"No individual bonus unless the entire store bonuses, which rarely ever happens. They pay overall, does not make a lot of sense. They show you how much you are making the company and when you see your pay stub it can get discouraging to keep it up."
good,"A typical day is fairly busy. Being able to seek customers and find them the right solution, to enhance their experience. And also make life easier for them."
good,"i enjoyed my time at best buy but the whole time i was working there i was constantly wondering when the manager was gonna call me in for my last shift. They told me i would be part time and that i would get off seasonal but just a few days after Christmas that day finally came where the manager let me go. I cant see myself working for another Best Buy because all the workers just seem to be the opposite of genuine. Best Buy felt like a fake setting and i wish i could elaborate on that more but constantly fearing for your job is not a fun way to work. If you were a warehouse associate, you were basically working two jobs. you would be doing your job plus the job of a sales associate without the pay."
good,taught me great leadership skills. selling skills. took care of employees that sold a lot of stuff. Went to disney world with them. they became more focused of cutting payroll so my tyipcal day doesnt apply anymore
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Working at best buy was a holiday job for me. The employees who trained me were great. The management was great and I enjoyed my experience and time working there.
good,Good place for working with cooperative team and decent working environment. Every day learning and gaining more and more practical experience especially dealing with all kinds of customers.
good,"typical day at work would be interactive with workers and customers depending on where your working. I worked in customer service and in home theaters. Customers service was much more busy and fast pace opposed to home theater it was more calm. I learned good customer service skills in the process. Hardest part of the job was when days were slow and not doing much the time goes by slow opposed to a fast paced day time goes by quicker. I enjoyed my day by helping others whether it be a customer or co-worker, and also having good laughs throughout the day."
good,"Best Buy is great place to work if you work great as an individual. As an associate you just have to do your job and you'll be by. Lots of great bonusing opportunities along with lots of great benefits. For management, even greater bonusing opportunities. Money is ok, good if you live with people with little to no monthly expenses. But its all retail. You won't have a personal life outside of Best Buy if you're in leadership. Overall a great place to work. I commute 60 miles each way just to get to work at my particular location, but it's taken a toll."
good,A typical day was enjoyable I knew exactly what I had to do for the shift. I learned inventory skills. Management was good. The workplace culture was good. The hardest part of the job was doing the audits. The easiest part was the day to day duties
good,"When I worked at Best Buy I appreciated the autonomy and decision-making afforded employees at all levels within the organization.  At the time I worked there the company lacked a firm strategy for the the long-term, which I have seen emerge now under new leadership."
good,"Teambased working environment, hardworkers, just about everything everyone looks for in a job. I will not forget all of the very useful skills Best Buy has brought myself to acquire."
good,"I put things on shelves, people bought the things, and then i did it again."
good,"Flexible hours and on-site learning. This job entailed product and software knowledge, customer interaction, and management of inventory. Overall it was fairly low-stress."
good,Know what the average pay is for the position. They will now ball you off you let them. Know how much the range of each level of certification is valued.
good,"Pretty good overall, kind of hard to get time off, or to call out even in the case of an emergency, sometimes you get taken off breaks, hard to get coverage, some managers are okay to work with"
good,During my time at Best Buy I was able to become familiar with the world of electronics which in fact has become useful in my everyday life. The morale of the staff was always upbeat.
good,Working at geek squad was an experience. I worked as a team to fix client computer issues and provide clients with solution to their technological problems. The management always pushed as and made sure we were providing the best customer service while succeeding.
good,"Excellent customer service, organization of products, and treatment of staff. Was a very helpful experience in learning to work well with others and I highly recommend it."
good,it became more about number and hitting goals then anything. It was not about the people and giving good customer sevice.  It was hard dealing with serious issues at times because managers would not respond in a timely fashion on the walkie's. Customers get upset and you cannot move on because the situation is not handled.
good,"Best buy in genreal was great at getting me started in the working field,but after a couple months in the job became very stale, the amount of coachings and other learning modules you have to do is insane. when i first started off i took over 20 hours of learning modules before i was put on the floor"
good,"Had a great time most days. Managers were shady and underhanded with employees. "
good,The company was a good place to work however the atmosphere was fast paced and competitive in many aspects.When walking around the business it felt like every person was on edge which drove most people to work to the best of their abilities.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"A typical day for a cashier & customer service specialist are fairy slow except on big release days & holidays. There's a bit of down time, followed by rushes of customers wanting to purchase or return/exchange items. Management spends a lot of time walking around frantically or on smoke breaks. The workplace culture is pretty childish considering employees range from all ages (which means plenty of gossip, ugh).  The hardest part is trying to grab the attention of a MOD (manager on duty) when in need. The most enjoyable is talking to customers."
good,"It was really nice I enjoyed my time there. The discount was amazing but also the atmosphere, super relaxed no back stabbing. Cool coworkers everybody got along."
good,"working in geek squad is not as easy as one would think. Given the way the staff are scheduled which is poorly, ill describe in this manner. Getting overwhelmed and no staff to help, is the main factor and having to go through multiple an multiple credential checks to sign someone in, is daunting. With only one person working the front, where all your time can be consumed by one client, an with a line piling up; you are locked into pressuring situations and you can not be helped and, you are to make sales with people an do your physical tasks too."
good,after working here I have learned many things from training and from the experience. However it is misleading when an employee is not commissioned but are expected to meet lofty goals set by company standards. Management is pretty poor (at least where I worked) and are given a lot of pressure to meet company goals and not the customer experience.
good,Fast paced environment helping customers with all of their electronic needs and questions. Motivated staff and supervisors with great management and leading.
good,Best buy was a cool place to work. Fun coworkers and not much work to do unless in a rush. They work with you on schedule usually if you give managers enough time.
good,Bonne ambiance de travail et bons avantages pour les employés ! BestBuy permet d’acquérir une bonne expérience dans le domaine de la vente.
good,"I appreciated the time i sent there. My coworkers and supervisors made life easy at Bestbuy. I however, felt that the training for the position could have been done in a different manor."
good,My time with Best Buy was hard and stressful but it was worth it i didn’t want to leave because the money was good but things happened so i had to relocate and start fresh
good,For the most part the job was very laid back and the fellow employees were usually pretty fun and helpful to work around. The only problem I had was feeling as if the management was not passionate about their positions and unwilling to listen to their employees.
good,"Fun culture, weekend team meetings, incentive to achieve sales goals, caring manager and supervisors. My time at Best Buy was like time with a second family."
good,"if you are good at selling, SELL there. They make the best money. Customer service is somewhat slow, except for seasonal times. I recommend it for kids in high school."
good,work gets intense during the holiday and they are always looking to hire seasonal workers. I learned great customer services skills. majority of the employees there were kind and helpful.
good,"it is a very fast paced environment while it may seem that no one is constantly on your back they are always watching you, managers sometimes speak rudely and give you different tasks that what you were originally assigned"
good,The benefits were great and working with customers was excellent. But management gets caught up in numbers and forgot about the employee. Management also had a tendency to only trust other management.
good,"I am specifically talking about Geek Squad. I never enjoyed the retail part of Best Buy, but Geek Squad definitely provides ample situations to learn how to perform actual repairs on computers if you're really into it."
good,"Low pay and hard work are expected in the retail industry. Depending on how busy your store is, this directly influences how busy geek squad can be. The demand for tech support is INSANE. Fun, entry level IT job that can teach you and let you practice the basics. Definitely not a viable career option as real engineering positions can easily pay double. Good spot to put on your resume. The pay could be better."
good,"Good place to work. There was some training when I worked there, but most product knowledge had to be self learned, so many employees had little knowledge of the products they were selling. It might have changed now."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I worked warehouse and delivery. I had a lot of fun with my jobs and the people I worked with. Warehouse management was poor and so was pay. Delivery was good.
good,worked around my school schedule. decent pay that allowed me to afford to live and work and complete my degree. more or less hours available based on request
good,"Nice productive company  with a fun environment.  Good with working around a schedule.  There isn't really a typical day at best buy only because it depends on the day and season, for instance the days in the summer are different from the winter days. I've defiantly have learned better communication and team building skills which has helped me grow into the person I am now."
good,"I value my weekends and holidays. If this is you, run! As far as a retail environment is concerned, Best Buy was actually really fun. I enjoyed the store manager and people I worked with. A great place to work if you love tech - especially if you are in school. Any gripe I have is with the nature of retail, so I can’t knock Best Buy too hard for that, but I will never score retail well. Ok, one thing: they do expect a lot in terms of sales accumen even though they don’t really pay for it."
good,Good managers and supervisors. Given a chance for raises and bonuses. Best part was interacting with customers and helping them find what they need. the job didnt really have any bad sides. I enjoyed my time there.
good,"Typical work day while I was a cashier consisted of handling regular customer transactions, as well as offering additional coverage on certain electronic items, and best buy credit cards. In customer service I handled customer returns/issues, as well as served as the back up admin assistant, handling nightly deposits, safe counts, register tills, etc."
good,"Great stepping stone but don't expect to get full time hours in a short period of time. Work, make your money, make a name for yourself and hope there's advancement."
good,"Enjoyable and friendly work environment. Management on all levels are willing to jump in and help all employees. Typical day at work had high and low moments, depending on the time of day. Holidays were the most difficult part of the job."
good,"✓	SWAT Inventory Specialist ensures inventory integrity in the store through a variety of inventory adjustments and data collection tools. "
good,"Worked seasonal 20-30 hrs a week, pay wasn't bad but not enough to live on. Managers are alright, a little pushy about selling plans at register. During Black Friday they bought tons of food and drinks for us even though we were worked like dogs."
good,I feel the company is only as good as the management.  Worked at 7 stores all over the country.  Unfortunately the last store i worked at had a horrible general manager.
good,"Best Buy is a fantastic place to work if you plan on getting your foot in the door of the technology industry.  But don't plan on it meaning much on your resume, it will just make you realize that technology changes so much that you need to keep up or you will fall behind."
good,"Working as a co-op student at Best Buy helped me learn and explore new things. I met new employees and developed good responsibilities from them as well. The employees at Best Buy made me feel like I belong with them as a family. They included me in team discussions and accepted me for not only my learning challenges but also my great work. I appreciate the time they took to help me to improve on my skills and abilities in order to be successful moving forward into my future. I became great friends with them and developed new skills that I can now be proud of and utilize within my future jobs/careers. I honestly miss working at Best Buy and being part of the great team of employees. I also miss learning and developing new skills as well as working in the technology environment. Since that field of business is what I am interested in, I definitely enjoyed working there and felt motivated to improve on the skills I currently had.  If I was given the opportunity to work at Best Buy again I wouldn't hesitate to take it. I would love to work there again!"
good,Enjoyed working here  as well as the discounts. Managment was decent. Places to eat on lunch down the street. Tv in the lunch room. Couple of refrigerators for food.
good,Great first job to apply for to gain the work experience. Everyday was just about helping customers and hitting sales targets. Everyday was a different day.
good,"Assistant Manager (who is in charge of sales) makes it very clear that you have to meet your quotas (even though you don't make commission). It doesn't matter if you win all of the contests and always make your quota. They push people to the point to where they don't want to try anymore."
good,Lots of experience to be gained within many areas of every day work.  Many opportunities to move up the company especially within a large location (big box).
good,I learned a lot via the online training they have. The counter agents have to deal with a lot of irate customers which is to be expected in a IT type role.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I learned a lot working there, most of us could multi task and work together so it made it a lot better environment, I would still do another season in a heart beat"
good,Was fun helping people find what they needed and then also showing them stuff they didn't know would really help them out. I enjoyed learning new information about the products through modules.
good,Management was friendly and fair.  I left Best Buy to pursue a higher paying job with less evenings.  I enjoyed with workplace culture and the most enjoyable part of my job were my fellow employees and the activities and training I received.
good,Fast paced work environment with great work qualities. My daily duties keep my maintenance skills up to date. The employees work together to get the job done.
good,"Over worked and under paid. Had to deal with lots of issues that managers should have dealt with . "
good,Best Buy is a friendly place to work and you may learn a thing or two about electronics. Most of my co-workers are friendly and happy to assist other employees with any questions they have.
good,"Always busy, I learned more about dealing with customers. I thought that the management was very good, and did their best to work with you every day. The hardest part was probably having too much downtime."
good,I was really luck in that my boss was a great and supportive coach.  I enjoyed my coworkers and being surrounded by technology was fun and interesting.
good,i loved working here the work was easy and not stressful i enjoyed all of my coworkers i learned how to meet my goal at a certain time and truly understand time management
good,alot of time commitment outside of work but still a fun place to work and play. you get to learn alot of stuff everyday as well technology is changing everyday
good,"I only worked part time at Best Buy while I attended university, but I found that it I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. Management was helpful and competent and my fellow employees were always a breeze to work with."
good,"no words to say, I have not worked for the company in years. I am not here to  talk about best buy. I am not sure what his is for. Have a wonderful day"
good,"It was a job that got me through until i found a more secure job. It was fast paced which i liked. the atmosphere was good, alot of young people. They should have a bonus structure"
good,"BestBuy is a wonderful place to work, especially if its your first job or if you've ever had experience in retail."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and the products we sold. The company was always stable employment for me. I was able to fall back on them to employ me more than once.
good,Overall it is a good company to work for. If you are looking to advance in your career this is not the place for you. Mornings are typically busy but nights are very slow. Management is professional and helpful. Coworkers are not always reliable.
good,The job is full of various challenges that are exciting to overcome with a team. Every day there's new technology to learn about and inform customers!
good,I liked the job and the company benefits for discounts and purchases was amazing.  I did not always care for managements approach to the balancing of equality between its employees
good,Fast paced work environment where all your coworkers become family. I have learned so much and grown from my experiences at Best Buy. I was able to travel the nation with this incredible company and build a network with so many from across the nation.
good,"I continued to learn how to work with customers while employed as an inventory associate at the Flagstaff Best Buy. Tasks included leading and working trucks, inventory control, processing online orders, and merchandising."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best part is to discover technology and learn to relate that to customers. Also selling warranty packages to ensure the lifetime of their products. Company has okay management and good perks.
good,"Best Buy is a great environment to work. They provide the new employees with all the tolls necessary for the job, the team is great and even during the busy times we have a lot of fun working together!"
good,"its a fun place to work , when you get the gaming department assigned to you. the break room in the back was a very cool place to relax whenever you get the chance."
good,"It a great place to work at. Pay wasn't all that great, hours weren't great either if you live alone. I was full time & I hardly ever saw 40 hours a week."
good,"Out of every retail job I've had, this one was the best paying.  Perhaps because of where I was at personally, I didn't create any lasting relationships as I did in past jobs but the management was excellent and the pay was acceptable.  The hours for Merchandising Specialist are completely understandable but the operating hours beginning at 6 a.m. became tuff over time."
good,"Very boring. About like any other retail job. Did many things while working there, but for the most part just stocked shelves and talked to customers."
good,"Graduate degree in progress, Travel Sales sector. Worked for ten years in customer service, my career has allowed me to be more experienced. Great adaptability. Recognized for my ability to connect with people and my ease to communicate. Provided with a good sense of initiative, resourcefulness and very good ability to work in teams or alone."
good,Amazing opportunity to advance as a line level and learn skills that will be used everywhere. A lot of preferential treatment as you climb the ladder.
good,"If you're looking for a great job to punch in and punch out this is it. You're able to sell and the time goes by. But do not go in with expectations of genuine praise. Every achievement is met with ""Great job but you can do better"". Even hitting 100% of the companies goal at time aren't enough they'll ask you to hit 120% without care you've hit the 100% mark"
good,"Overall Best Buy is a great company to work for, like most companies it depends on the location you work at. Unlike a lot of retail companies you are not just a number and you are cared about as an employee."
good,"Great work environment. Excellent training for the various departments desired to work in. Great place to learn and advance amongst your coworkers. If they had an opening, I'd debate going back to this day."
good,"Fun fast paced environment, competitive. Benefits are great if you're a full-time employee only. You can only grow if you're cool with management. It's not about what you know, it's who you know."
good,"At the time i worked there two separate managers were giving me different hours without communicating this each other, one in the computer and one in a scheduling log book. This error resulted in my leaving their employment as I was viewed responsible for not coming in during my shift, for which i never knew what my shift was."
good,"I had a great time until my managers pushed a dispute onto me which ended in trouble between a lot of coworkers.  Other than that, I enjoyed the fast pace nature"
good,Best Buy was an overall great experience.The workers was friendly and the management was very helpful. We all worked as a team to get the job done in  a timely manner.
good,Its a nice place to work for sure. I like it and so will you. Im just filling this form out because why not. ..........................................
good,I liked working at Best buy on the only thing that annoyed me as that the employees they hire are not that knowledgeable as you think they are and while working there I was abused to go to every department and assist an employee confused about the products in the department they were assigned too. But it was whatever work is work and I really couldn't complain
good,There was not really much work/life balance during the busy holidays time but the schedule worked very well when I was attending school. The pay was not very good and newer employees often started at higher pay rates. But there are very good employee discounts.
good,I love working at geek squad but unfortunantly hours can be hit ot miss due to everything having to be based off of labor we create by checking in devices. Some weeks we will all have around 40 hours nad some weeks less than 20
good,"I enjoyed working for Best Buy.  Since I worked at a smaller location, they had to trust in my talents to perform tasks and duties since they couldn't be everywhere at once."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I enjoyed working for the company cause they have great benefits but not managements. I want to go back to school they refused to work around my school schedule.
good,Over the years that I have worked with BestBuy. I have meet some of the most amazing people to work with. Have Fun While Being The Best. You should work here
good,"Solid job, good to work while attending school. Good to work if you want to go into retail management. Don't work there as a slave wage forever, go salary and/or get a degree and get out."
good,"Decent workplace culture with good management, people explain what you have to work on for the day instead of leaving you hanging"
good,All of the managers and supervisors are great. Its retail so the customers and the pay sucks there are no benefits for part-time employees. Did I mention how rude the customers are?
good,"It is a good job to have while you are working to better yourself. The job provides great experience that can be used in future careers, careers that you work towards your entire life."
good,"A typical day at work consisted working with a lot of different types of people and each with a different set of needs. I learned that you really need to listen to the customer to find out what their perfect solution would be for their individual situation."
good,"Help people every day with their computer problems."
good,"Good job to work at, but there is a lot of inconsistency in the employment. Many new people coming in and many people leaving. Hours can be consistent or inconsistent."
good,"enjoyed my job while i had it, very easy just not enough hours, greatt managers and great employees, everyone is friendly and very helpful to others. easy job to pick up on and learn"
good,A fun and competitive place to work if you are customer oriented. They provide adequate training and make sure you have all the tools you need to succeed.
good,"It was a very good first job learning experience.  I enjoyed my peers and my Management team. Moving up with the company is very easy, especially if you put the hardwork into it."
good,"People were cool I didn't do much except find items in the store customers needed, and either ship them or have them ready for store pick up. Also found stuff in   the warehouse that couldnt be found in the floor such as T.V.s and whatever else."
good,"Worked here for a while, really enjoyed it. Made wonderful relationships that I wouldn't change for the world. However management can be better, GM's are great, never really around. The sales team is their everything, everyone is just kind of there. Favouritism is a problem, but that is in any workplace. Overall, awesome place to work, pay could be better."
good,"Employees are a joy to work with, co-workers and managers are always on hand to help anyone that needs it. Must be knowledgeable on products that are being sold and able to answer questions from customers."
good,"- Part-time doesn't benefit you at all. "
good,"Cool place to work for a teenager but you will outgrow it quickly. As you start to look for better pay and better opportunities, you will realize the bottom part of the corporate ladder is very hard to climb because the pay increases are minimal."
good,"Best buy:"
good,great place to start your career. Many opportunities for advancement within the company and if you decide to move on from a store. Most locations are VERY accepting of transfer/transplant employees.
good,"During my time here, I worked with many great people.  Learned most of my sales techniques and skills from this company. Unfortunately I had a family and retail hours, working Thanksgiving Day,  And the job only paid me $10.95/ hour for a sales lead position.  When I asked for a raise they acted like the bent heaven and earth to give $11.13/hour.  Not a great salary to live on. Other than pay,  this is a great company. I have heard they changed their ways and pay better now."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The everyday job life at Best Buy is awesome! You get to play with new tech everyday and learn about future tech. Working there was also great due to the fact you got to make experiences with customers. Making customers happy and seeing their reactions to new tech was great. Management was not bad but I personally feel could have been better. I would definitely recommend this job to someone who has a passion for technology. I just do not see it being a long term job unless you're okay with low pay for awhile.
good,Is helping customers find the right solutions while having fun and being the best. I love it when customers come in not knowing anything or little to nothing and I'm able to give them all the right solutions plus more than they expected.
good,"A productive work day includes to have fun while being the best. We, BestBuy, love to be competitive with our different store locations just to have something to look forward to. We manage to always keep customers happy and go out of our way to ensure they have had a great experience and will visit us again. The most challenging part of the job is keeping up with the different daily promotions we have going on, because they do change almost EVERY day, however if we perform good, we get some incentives."
good,Great GM & Assistant GM.  The store did only offer me a FT after I put in my two week notice. I always met my weekly goals along along with opening up new Best Buy Credit Cards but never got a raise or offered more hours until the end of my time working for Best Buy.
good,good entry level job just like any other retail job. opportunity for advancement was clearly an issue as positions seem to go to those already preselected
good,"•	Responsible for receiving and shipping merchandise to/from store and to stock merchandise in the warehouse or on the sales floor."
good,"best buy est une grande entreprise, performante avec une très bonne qualité de service grâce aux équipes qui travaillent au sein de l'entreprise et à la bonne gestion des gérants"
good,I really enjoy dealing with customer. Helping them with their wants and needs. I got to manage a bunch of good people and to see the go above my expectations always gave me validation that I was doing a good job as there manager.
good,"worked 3 other retail jobs, none of them quite had the same culture as best buy. obviously, sales and numbers are very important to them but they do great coaching and really try to encourage positivity in order to succeed"
good,This is a good place for your first job or a part time job. If you are looking to subsidize some income as well. Relaxed working conditions and they do recognize hard working individuals.
good,"A typical day at work was standing at the front of the store and greeting customers and watching the floor for potential theft.  While it was certainly enjoyable and exciting on some occasions the main frustration came from the lack of support on the floor whenever there was a risk and the long time to wait before a lunch break was available and there were days that I wasn't able to take a lunch but this is a minor complaint.  All in all the atmosphere in the store was good, the management was new but receptive and the team as a whole worked fairly well together."
good,"Lots of the latest computer products to deal with."
good,it was a great place to work. The management was really nice and we were always up to date on the latest and greatest tech that comes out. Its always fun working with stuff that youre interested in.
good,"While Best Buy has a great atmosphere and prides itself on making sure it's employees are up to date on the latest technology, pay levels have been dropping off these last  few years and the process to advance within the company is convoluted and very political."
good,It's a nice place to work at. You get to learn a lot regarding hardware and software in the Geek squad Department. You get amazing discounts working as an employee.
good,L'expérience de travail est enrichissante et l'esprit d'équipe est très motivante.
good,"Best Buy was just an okay job, when I was being trained I was expected to already know everything. Training was also when I got my most house about 25 once I got out of training I was working 1 maybe 2 days a week"
good,"I was a salesman in the computer department.  I loved working in that department, because computers have long been a part of my life. I'm glad I took the position."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Bestbuy is a nice start for anybody who has no work experience and wants to start building their sales and customer experience skills. Tons of positions available from cashier to computers specialist to cell phone consultant to magnolias tv consultants. Lots of different areas bestbuy has where you can maximize your skills to build yourself as a strong sales associate or even develop into a manager position at some point in the future.
good,"Best Buy is a great company to work for while in school. The schedule isn't so flexible with full time employees, especially those that represent vendors in the store. It is definitely fun to learn about all the products and to compete for sales goals. It is a NON COMMISSION based job so it is likely that some of the job roles (in sales) are able to be compensated more with a similar company that offers commission based selling. Overall, great company. Choose the store you want to work for wisely. Each store's culture and work dynamics are completely different."
good,"The most rewarding part of the job was watching my employees grow and climb up the ladder and knowing I had a part in that. "
good,I loved working at Best Buy in League city however the pay was not enough to keep me there for too long.  I wish they paid more and of course working retail hours is never fun.
good,"Part-time has little benefits but paid okay, hard to rise up without years of experience under your belt. some days slow and fast all depends on the store and your role in the store"
good,Always learning about new products. Helping customers find exactly what meets their needs is very satisfactory. Many great deals available for employees. Good communication skills required.
good,it was fun and looked forward to coming in to work. I hope to work for best buy again sometime soon and make it into a career. i had a great time working there.
good,"was a good part time job overall, but you are not promised hours, and they over staff a ton. resulting in less hours for everyone else. i enjoyed my time there but since i left it has gotten worse"
good,"Great company.  Great training and supportive fellow employees.  Great management.  High energy environment with many rewards for learning and doing great work."
good,"Overall, it's a great culture, and the benefits are pretty stellar.  Your experience with Best Buy is really going to depend on your location and your manager, some were top notch, and some I wandered how they kept their job.  I think my biggest issue was the constant restructures, and eliminated jobs.  My own job was eliminated 6 times in 10 years, and each time they eliminated a role, they ended up bringing it back in a year or two because they were in fact needed."
good,"I love helping customers with there computer related issues, once in a great while it can be challenging but rewarding to see them come around. coworkers are all very nice and a pleasure to be around."
good,The environment in a big box store provides a culture to empower it's employees to make decisions and provide a level of service that is not normally found in large retail stores.
good,"Many goals to reach, if you did not reach them you a manager or supervisor would speak to you to ""motivate"" you to do better. The work place was a fast pace environment during holidays and slow on other days. The hours were very poor, thus, if you're looking for hours at this store you will need to take shifts from other co workers."
good,"Best Buy was a big corporate, however their retail stores were well orientated.  The hours are flexible for students or employees with part time jobs there.  Customers came first for Best Buy."
good,"This job was fine for my first job or maybe a part time job. There is a high turn over rate due to it being retail. There are usually a lot of people that call out of work so you can easily pick up extra hours if you are willing to come in. There are many elearnings that you can learn about the different products or electronics. Employee discount is great. Typical day involves greeting multiple customers, cleaning your area, may have to put away product on truck days, updating price labels when needed."
good,As a inventory specialist I received in all merchandise from the warehouse. We scanned in product and put it out on the floor. We also assisted customers in loading their appliances or any other thing needed.
good,"Everyone is great. very family like atmosphere. Apply you won't regret it. Be prepared to wait the application process does take a while, but its just so they can get the best people."
good,Flexible hours and decent pay for college students. Sales atmosphere is not for me and the incentive to sell is based on bonuses for monthly sales team quotas. Sometimes they're unrealistic when the company doesn't want to pay them out.
good,I was part time and stayed in one department. I had a great team and management. I worked in the warehouse but I went out on the floor during the busy hours to help customers.
good,"A typical work day consisted of stocking, organizing, sales transactions, promotions, and memberships. I learned to work with different customers, work a register, and how to make a store appear visually exciting. The management was not present to often. The culture was ok. Nothing exciting. The hardest part of the job was the theft. The most enjoyable part was getting to work for a company that sold the latest technology."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Overall it was a pleasant experience even though it was for a short duration. The employees make up a large portion of enjoying your work day, the overall management was professional but looked out for us as much as possible."
good,a lot of people come into best buy everyday wanting knowledge on product and because its not commission based you can really give the best help you can but because its hourly pay you run into a few employees who are fine with just standing there and don't care for helping the customers.
good,Great place with many career options and opportunities. Non commission based selling makes work less stressful. Great management team that are willing to help.
good,Great company to work for had no problems what so ever would highly recommend this job to anyone great pay great people wonderful management its a fantastic starter job
good,"Best Buy is a great company to work for that allows you learn many skills and grow as a business professional. The wages and salaries are fair. However, there are not as many opportunities for career advancement within the company and hours can be scarce during certain periods."
good,I have learned a lot from Best Buy.  The best part is the people you work with everyday.  It is a very diverse workplace culture which brings together a lot of great ideas.  The hardest part of the job personally was the inability to plan for your family life around the job with the fluctuation in the hours worked.
good,I liked working here I got a lot from working in a sales environment with a lot of great like minded people. I loved the discounts. Working Black Friday was insane but still a lot of fun.
good,you would have a briefing in the morning letting us know what's the promotions are about. for that day awesome company. I would work for them anytime.  we also play some very intresting games as well
good,"Great place to work while your in college, not a lot of stress and good atmosphere. If in the sales or business field is a great way to develop techniques, learn of tactics on sales, be competitive, learn on inventory and sales skills, management of team work and customer service"
good,"I love working here, it's just I'm not getting enough hours to survive. The environment is relaxing and easy going, as well as the people working there."
good,"Enjoyed my co-workers but, I did encounter some employee drama. It felt a little like high school with people arguing over things that did not pertain to our jobs."
good,"A typical day at work consists of selling, selling, and more selling. I was told the best way to sell was not the sell out of your own pocket. It worked for a while, but I thought more about the customers ability to pay for the items. And then there was the Best Buy credit card, which is a huge focal point in meeting your numbers for the day, week, and overall month. Management is okay, but favoritism is a big issue amongst the staff. There's nothing hard about the job, unless you have issues selling. It's kind of difficult to meet your goals when your coworker takes your sale. But there are always customers, so there is always opportunity to sell."
good,My time at Bestbuy I would say was average. I started as seasonal like most people and through hard work obtained a part-time position. I didn't have much career goals as managers would change often or I would be moved to different departments. I don't see myself at BestBuy for a career as I am not passionate for retail and career progression is not heavily emphasized though most staff.
good,"- The work very easy to pick up, people are easy going. "
good,I worked at Best Buy as a seasonal worker. I worked extremely hard the entire time I was there. I even worked on the days I had off for people who didn’t want to work their scheduled shifts. I even prevented several thefts. Sad to say even after they initial stated they wanted to keep me they let me go.
good,"Fun place to work, however, hours get cut severely after the holidays. Management is understanding and does their best. Lots of group meetings and pump ups."
good,"Awesome company, not many hours, but the pay is there and the skills are well worth it. The management was alright could improve but they treat theyre employees fairly."
good,"Management is awesome and will work with you. It is fast paced and you will be trained across your entire department and then set where your best. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best Buy Mobile is the best place to work for at Best Buy. A lot of opportunities are available to individuals that work that. Take advantage of the awesomeness that it offers.
good,"Fun and fast paced work environment. Great place to learn, grow and develop customer service skill. Appropriate recognition- Monetary and Non-monetary with incentives like employee discounts and health benefits."
good,"Great job when you're first starting out. After receiving a certification or degree though, you will want to look elsewhere. In my opinion, Geek Squad employees are underpaid which is why Best Buy has such a high turnover rate with them. Best Buy discounts are a plus and so are the benefits. However, the pay is the main problem. Mobile department employees make more money than the guys who have to perform repairs on: Windows XP-10 devices, iOS devices, Mac OS X devices, Android devices, etc. That seems a little backwards to me. Overall I recommend the job for those starting out, but don't stay for any longer than you have to. Get your degree/certification/experience and move on to bigger and better things."
good,"Working at the Geek Squad was rewarding. However, working the floor was somewhat less than satisfying to someone with my skills. Had they offered more room to advance I might have stayed."
good,"Working in customer service is never fun, but Best Buy customer service is especially bad. Mostly the customers and short return policy made it pretty stressful at times. The people I worked with made it more fun, but without that it would suck"
good,"I have always enjoyed working at best buy but the management at the palm beach lakes blvd store (0550) is very poor. The General Manager, in particular, is exceptionally difficult to work with."
good,"This was a good place to work at times.  Obviously Black Friday was NOT a fun day to work, but no where in retail is it fun to work on Black Friday.  It's just too busy a day"
good,Best Buy has great coworkers and really nice managers. It's a great first job for a 16 year old living at home and going to school but not exactly suitable for an adult.
good,"Having the opportunity to work in different stores showed me how the work environment and culture can be VERY different depending on location. All the locations are competitive with another, and generally there is a good sense of team spirit and management tries very hard to create that feeling. It isn't always totally successful. If you have a range of skills, expect to get moved around a lot. At the time I was there, they were very strict about time-clock rules which could get to be a bit ridiculous. Management normally has the employees back, though brown-nosing seems to be favored."
good,Best Buy is a great place to start working and management is rather friendly. The people there are generally very nice and considerate so it always made for a fun place to work. There is a lack of movement though within the store. There are those that have movement form not only departments to departments but from lower/entry positions to leadership positions. However every time I would try to move from my current location I would be turned down in favor of another and this happened multiples times and each time I was told that I didn't have the skills that they were looking even though they would comment on such skills.
good,A typical day at work is high maintenance. Having to maintain sales goals on a typical workday made it sometimes stressful. On a typical work day an employee was told about sales goals that needed to be met. These goals were created depending on how previous days were busy. If goals were not met for that day than an explanation was needed for why these goals were not met. The work place culture was a very comfortable place to work for as management will train on site to try to have increased sales made.I learned how to craft my sales of electronics and insurance plans called Geek Squad support. I learned how to work with others discussing sales approaches.
good,"	Repaired customer electronic components at the service center and was the top technician for 11 years out of a total of 11 centers across the US. "
good,"Bestbuy is a great place to be, the culture is one of the best ive ever seen. I have had the privilege of creating new and amazing friendship while working at bestbuy. Everyday is always new and exciting, I Get To meet new people who come in the store who either know everything about technology or nothing at all. Its always fun talking about the new tech that comes out."
good,It is your average retail job. Work holidays weekends black fridays you name it. Never 2 of the same days off every week. Couldn't plan anything really other that a fly by night idea. Decent management and more that not laid back atmosphere with cool new tech to play with every month made it manageable.
good,I was working in the inventory department and focused on quality and accuracy to ensure customers would be receiving their units in great conditions and on time.
good,"Hard to advance and if you do somehow advance there is always a threat of losing your position. It was a great place at first, but once the stock dropped it became overbearing and micro managing"
good,Learning and applying various technical skills throughout the day. Management is fair and reasonable. The workplace culture was alright. Hardest part of the job would be informing a customer that we are unable to repair their computer due to it being infested with insects. The most enjoyable part of the job is that there is always something new to learn.
good,"The company in general is great, however the one I worked at had issues. The manager knew nothing of technology, yet ran a tech repair center. The pay was alright, but the raises were rare and tiny. Work was in a retail environment, so that added a lot of stress."
good,"this was a temporary position.  when I announced that I was leaving the company, they tried to recruit me for some of the full time positions that were available.  I was already committed to a different employer"
good,"FOR THE benefits its good . they also give you a lot of hours . great employees , i wouldn't say its a bad job it teaches you alot about certain areas"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Fun place to work if your young. It was cut throat with some associates. Team work was hard to get with some associates. Managers never coach always delegated work with no help
good,"Not a bad place to work really, although the store manager wanted the asset protection guys to function as door greeters instead of doing the actual job they hired us to do."
good,Best Buy is a fun place to work at but no matter where you are or where you work. Expect to have to sell. That means basically no matter where you work in the store expect to have to be a salesman of some sort.
good,"- Great management"
good,"Best by had some great people to work with. Fast paced and energized. However, when it was slow, management micromanaged heavily. This was the only real down side to working there,"
good,Relaxed but busy during certain times of the year. Certain departments also are treated differently so choose wisely. More room for advancement in sales department.
good,"I worked from 2pm to usually 11pm monday-friday and it was a decent place to work at. The employees were nice, and my manager was a nice guy. Work was usually just grabbing items and putting it on a pallet, wrapping the pallet and then loading the pallet onto the trucks. A little monotonous but the breaks were nice as it had multiple tv's and a ps3 connected to one for people to relax."
good,Good people to work with.  Lots of ongoing training for those that don't know technology that well.  Opportunity for advancement if you are looking for a career.
good,"Getting payed 11 dollars an hour in an area surrounded by minimum wage jobs was a huge plus. The management cared little for scheduling you around hours you could actually work (Was a student) but the work itself was easy and the job payed nicely. If management was better, id say this job was great."
good,only thing that I had a problem with when it came to this company was when it came to scheduling as I was unable to get enough hours to pay all of my bills.
good,"Great work atmosphere with diversified colleagues. Management is always a stressful element as well as sales incentives. Pay has increased due to market forces. Hours are flexible and encouraging for students. Hardest part of the job is adhering to standards, protocol and daily duties, most enjoyable part are the employees that work there."
good,"My current position in best buy has allowed me to move up to become a supervisor, something that in the beginning i never thought i would want to become. I worked hard and was able to become a leader. This is a great company for those who want a great career choice while attending school."
good,I enjoyed my time at the company as a whole but it was a very clear case of people don't quit jobs they quit management.  One manager can ruin a store and ruin a great culture
good,"Nice place to work in a fun environment. Can be ""unstimulating"" and other retail stress obstacles. Hard to break into upper management if you havnt had more than 3 years experience with the company"
good,if you need a day off you are told to find someone to trade a shift with.  this can be very hard to do as there are several people in the department working different shifts and if you don't know some of them or they don't know you then you cant trade shifts.
good,Best buy was fun to work at in the beginning. It was great going to to work and doing your job.  Easy to get promoted and move up. The housing market crash on 2007 really put a damper on my job as in home appliance repairman.
good,Its tough hard work in the warehouse where you are less appreciated than the salesman out on the floor but do more work then they do. The management is alright depending on your store.
good,"the hardest part about inventory is truck nights. the truck is usually around 4,000 pieces and there is only three people to put everything up so we end up staying in the store until 3-4 in the morning."
good,"Working there was always interesting and unique. It was an environment of fun and competitiveness yet the higher management (store management and higher) was always in flux, changing, or uncertain. This made for an ever changing expectation on associates, which was rarely a problem but quite exasperating when you are trying to find a rhythm."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The old GM was awesome did her job very well loved her. As for the manager that was over my department he was unfair when it came to certain employees. I did have a good experience working there but it was time to go when they put me to work once a week
good,Productive and busy workplace with leaders that leave some to be desired. Scheduling was usually put up at the last possible second and often had not taken employees' lives into account.
good,Working at Best Buy is good when trying to go to college. Flexible work schedules to help fit with school. However the demand for revenue can be grating.
good,"Some days are fast paced and it doesn't feel like you are there for 8 hours, while other days can drag on for so long. Depending on what department you work for, they can have you working another area that you did not interview for, or have any knowledge about, while expecting you to meet all the goals of the original employee assigned to the job."
good,"i love working for best buy it is defiantly a diverse environment and has taught me many different thing as far as business and technology, I have also learn the reality of how working as a team is the key to success within any company."
good,"To advance you have to be in the ""club"" and a lot of a.. kissing. Lots of favoritism and bias."
good,"As an Advanced Repair agent, I go through checked in units for repair and troubleshoot/diagnose the issues and repair the problems customer requested."
good,"Like any company, best buy has it's own private problems, but overall one of the best retails I've ever worked at by far! With every new CEO comes time and patience from everyone to learn and grow together."
good,good job to have while in college. they work around your schedule very well and allow you to have time off when needed. the people are cool and environment is nice
good,Everyday is a different adventure while meeting great clients and associates. Trained me to be a calibrator and a Home Theater specialist. Management is fair and you always knew what they expect from you.
good,"Beyond the fact that the work was enjoyable, personally, management was agreeable and communicative; workmates were pleasant, experienced and always willing to answer questions."
good,"I wish my life hadn't changed, I'd still be there. I have no complaints. I loved the people and the work. I went in, and was the"", go to guy."" Unfortunately my father got cancer and I had to resign in order to take care of him."
good,"The job itself is fast paced, you never know what you're going to get. You can try to have fun, some people are cool, but the quality of Agents is dropping and the company isn't what it used to be."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work. Fast paced retail environment.the culure"
good,"It's a blast working in BestBuy. Great people, open space. I love the environment in witch we work in. The only things is that I didn't feel like I got paid enough for what I was working"
good,Best Buy wasn't thinking of family and mental health when coming up with this job because i promise you it will slowly devour you like cancer so don't apply for this job unless you have 0 kids and 0 plans in the future to have any that you can actually see grow and develop.
good,"great place to work, easy pace for anyone to work with. very calm environment. game rooms. sit down job with easy to learn work load. break room café for days you forgot a lunch."
good,"I enjoyed the work and life experience this company has brought me. I learned new skills and made many friends along the way, I am receptive to the company."
good,Good place with a good team. Management and upper management just weren't usually on the same page. Training was a weak area here but the crew usually weren't shy to assist.
good,As an Automotive Installer the work is fun and interesting but chances of advancement is moderate. The pay is not so great even with a Masters certification. Highly underpay their installers
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"It's retail. So there were times that management was great and times it was terrible. Pay wasn't bad if you were able to move into higher positions. Early on, you might want more hours. as you get into leadership positions, it seems like you never leave."
good,"Its a great place to start for  part time  job . You can learn different things about computers and phones , High Definitons  television like for example how to reboot a computers and cleaning viruses ."
good,Best Buy was a great environment for retail sales experience.  You get to learn and experience the latest and greatest in home technology products. The employee discount is a great perk as well.
good,"Not about what you know, It's who you know. I love working with advancing technology consistently changing, especially for a company that loves to keep up with that.. problem is ..... Not about what you know, It's who you know."
good,Fun place to work. Too much focus on sales numbers instead of customer experience. You get to learn a lot about new technology and get nice discounts but I’d prefer if the sales weren’t so forced.
good,"Pay is about average for retail without commission, benefits are good. Management is also flexible with student schedules and life.Compensation is low."
good,"It was a great place to work for part time, it provided a great opportunity to build customer service and basic sales skills. The ability to be in front of a diverse group day in and day out solving each issue is by far irreplaceable."
good,Working for Best Buy is extremely rewarding as you work with excellent people and have fun while being the best. I am very honored to say that I work for them
good,"- the coworkers are great "
good,"The workplace at my store is good, but when it comes to how management handles situations is not good. I currently work in the computer department as a part timer and weekends are supposed to be the busiest. Theres consistently always 1 person scheduled to close on weekends, and it is a big department to have 1 person close and have to deal with 10+ customers by themselves. It is very frustrating when the department leader never closes and leave at 7pm everyday and leave 1 person till 9:30 having to deal with a lot of customers and clean up the department by themselves."
good,"Solid campus (two coffee shops, daycare, gym, decent cafeteria)"
good,"Best Buy is a fantastic location to work and grow, if you've got the right managers and are willing to put time in to advance. Best Buy is very much a store that is rampant with favoritism over results. For every amazing manager I had, I had three lack luster ones that I wasn't sure what they actually did on a day to day basis and seem more bent on keeping me where I was then helping me move up in the company, this is especially true if you are a top performer."
good,"Fairly solitary position, hands-on work, typically need a solid background in electronics to succeed. Very fairly compensated for work. You are the expert for the whole store for the department. Would not want to work in another position here."
good,"Best Buy is a fun and great company to work for that definitely cares about its employees.  It has great benefits, wonderful opportunities, and the chance to do some very fun things as part of the job."
good,"Great place to work, you can definitely work your way to the top and get promotions if you exceed at your job."
good,"If one is looking for a great start in a career in sales, Best Buy is a great place to work.  It will help you with your communication skills and allow you to be a ""people's person"" There is room for advancement if one does work hard."
good,"Pretty relaxed. Stressful during peak hours, they work with your schedule. The management seemed happy, but most began leaving one after another?? This was a red flag."
good,Was amazing place to be for the first 10 years I was there. Lots of recognition for performance and a fun competitive environment. Started going downhill during all the layoffs but looks like they are coming back.
good,I loved working here when I worked seasonal. The coworkers were great.  The downside was some of the customers but that's a downside to most retail jobs.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I worked in the mobile section. I learned a lot about cell phone services. The culture was young and hip, which made it easy for someone my age to blend."
good,"I have worked for Best Buy for three years now, I have applied to about 4 positions without any luck. I've learned that Best Buy uses a lot of favoritism and one must be available for after work activities to fit in. Best Buy is very ""clicky"" and one has to follow the ""Pied Piper"" if you know what I mean. Myself being of a leader mentality find that difficult to do with all due respect towards Management. But it is a great place to learn discipline, responsibilities, financial terms and acronyms."
good,"fun and exciting workplace at times"
good,Good work enviroment.  Young staff.  Only draw back is that you are not guaranteed a certain amount of hours if you are part time.  Full time hours is still under 40 hours.  The discount is great and getting geek squad protection on products is super discounted as well.
good,"While you are working at best buy, just do your best and try to move up. The faster you move up, the better it will be for your next job. Best Buy is not a bad place to work, but just make sure you know what you want to do while you are there."
good,"I have worked a four different best buy store in two states and only one had a negative vibe to it. the bet part of working for best buy is the culture. everyday you can come in with a frown and leave with a frown if you want to, id suggest a smile but that's me. the other cool part of best buy is if you want to move and keep your job you can, as long as there is an opening at a store near you. also if you decide to leave and do so on good terms you will be welcomed back with open arms if you want to comeback or just want to work seasonal for extra cash (you will be on top of the list automatically). your coworkers are usually into the products you sell so most of the time you can find common interests and make the days go by quickly. in my time working there the management varied greatly between stores. some ruled with an iron fist to prove they were in power and others felt like you should enjoy your job and a happy employee will make customers happy. the only bad things i can say is that in every location the inventory team gets worst of it. no respect, no help, and all the blame. its the hardest job in the company and takes tough skin and strong work ethics to do it. but the people with the most pride in their job is inventory so everyone back there will give you what you need to succeed in further job pursuits."
good,Best Buy is one of the excellent client where it provides a good environment for the employees to work.The management here is very good so that it provides an environment to work effectively
good,"It was good working with people who had a lot of potential, but management was always bad. Good culture, it would always leave a bad taste in your mouth."
good,"Overall was an okay profession, typical day involved clocking in at the start of the shift and just working in your department, and go where help is needed. Most enjoyable was probably learning about all the new up and coming gadgets and the hardest was communication with customers as most customers assumed you knew everything about all tech and your were the Subject Matter Expert for anything that ran electricity. Culture was extremely friendly, most co-workers were open to help whenever needed. Things I learned on the job was fine tuning my resilience, because not everyday is a good day."
good,"Salary was good, nice people.  Long hours, not a standard 8-5 job. The workplace culture was stressed when a new CEO was announced, and layoffs started happening.  It was coined 'termination Tuesday'.  I do hope that the company will reduce these measures now that it has been turned around."
good,Had great time working at Best Buy. Learned a lot of good information that I still use to this day. Worked for the Mobile department and Home Theater.
good,"This job is very competitive because of all the benefits employees receive for being the best in their department.  Employees have to meet a certain revenue amount each month per shift.  There is always goals to reach and when employees reach those goals or go beyond them, they are rewarded in some way.  You are in a competition everyday you go to work to prove you are the best salesman on the floor."
good,"It is a good college job. I like working here for the experience with electronics and overall customer experience. The pay is also pretty nice, but not necessarily something I would live off of unless I became a manager."
good,I enjoy working at best buy but the compensation is pretty bad. The management is pretty exceptional and they care about your issues but sometimes seem helpless about what to do. It is hard to learn anything through there online learning and its best to take it upon yourself to learn the product. The hardest part about this job is when it slows down they still expect you to perform well. for example  when there is 1 or 2 customers and 15 associates they still want you to hit your goals for the day. But I would say that the employees really make this job worth while.
good,"I truly enjoyed this job and the company. We had a great team, a wonderful senior staff, and probably the best manager ive ever had there. So I'd go back at any time."
good,Great place to work. Delivery Drivers make good money. You are your own manager for the most part. If you are good with people and can lift up to 350 pounds with co-worker you will do fine.
good,I loved the friendly staff member that I encountered at work. The manager was very approachable and understanding to the needs of the employee's. They were more than willing to meet the scheduling needs for staff and their personal day to day lifestyles.
good,très bon environnement de travail. Best buy est une compagnie qui permet de développer plusieurs compétences.
good,"Pay was good, the job was when I was in high school was a lot and expected a lot out of their workers. But, it did help provide me with skills that I could use once leaving Best Buy."
good,Great place to gain experience in the computer and electronics world. Good pace and flexible hours! Good starting salary! Would recommend to anyone who is trying to gain experience and learn new things.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Job was fairly straight forward."
good,"It's a decent place to work.  Peak season (November to January) is brutal, and absolutely brutal if you work in the e-commerce department. But overall you're treated pretty well."
good,"Started as a seasonal employee, quickly made my way to part time"
good,Fun place to work. Teamwork oriented. Simultaneously casual and professional. Requires product knowledge and customer service skills. Management was never very helpful.
good,"Working for Best Buy is a pretty simple job where the people you work with become a family. A typical day starts out very dead in most departments on weekdays so you're expected to make sure you're up to date with your e-learnings during that down time. If you have the first shift of the day you'll probably have a very routine schedule and it will likely not be too busy for your entire shift unless you're in the computer department or appliances. If you work the middle shift expect to be busy the whole time assisting with multiple departments even if you don't work in them. The closing shift is often dead and they're expected to assist with customers, clean their department and downtock for the next day. Overall, its a simple and easy job to do if you know about products. Unfortunately, all management cares about is credit cards and protection plans. I've seen some amazing salespeople there that sold thousands of dollars but if they couldn't get a credit card in the sale or protection on every item in the sale then management wouldn't acknowledge it as an accomplishment. That is very discouraging for some people. Other than that it's an amazing company to work for. If you want to move up in positions expect to have to work their for over 5 years before that happens."
good,"Best Buy is a good place to work in retail. Personally I didn't care for the corporate retail industry, but it had a good workplace culture. It was very diverse and had pretty good management. HR manager should be replaced. It was difficult to accomplish anything when the HR manager was involved. They did not have good employee relations, they were frequently bias, and had absolutely no idea about daily operations (not even the simplest task). I was extremely turned off by this manager, I could have been harsh due to my education and experience in human resources. Everything else was pretty good, customers, co-workers, and other management was great!"
good,"I enjoyed working with my colleagues and managers. The job mostly consisted of interacting with customers. Schedule was nice and flexible. Overall, it was a good starter job to have."
good,"Ok place to work. Lots of training with the variety of products that are sold there which is a great thing. Could have more supportive management, with more of an ""open-door policy."""
good,"Bust Buy is a fun working environment, especially if you enjoy electronics. You are given the knowledge on the products and often get the opportunity to preview new tech before its out."
good,"Best Buy is not a bad company to work for, employee discounts are definitely worth it. The company is still trying to 'find itself though, so there will be changes."
good,Best Buy is an amazing place to work with great people. I worked for best buy for two and half years and really enjoyed the work that i had to do day to day.
good,"good place to work, great first job or for those in school. good diversity. easy to learn in the work place. company utilizes e -learnings and additional training called sales induction for a week."
good,"Nice people, Great if you love tech. The pay could be a lot better, each store is different and depending on your department your incentives can change."
good,"Geek Squad was a cool place to work. It was fun in that you are immersed in the latest technology and you learn a lot about computers, insurance policies, and tech in general."
good,"Wow, if you like technology then this is the place for you, it has practically everything. youare able to transfer to different departments to experence the different products in each area."
good,Many opportunities to learn about consumer electronics. Relatively laid back environment. Seasonal employees are often hired on after season's end. Over all would recommend for students.
good,"I learned a lot at this job, seeing how I was in Geek Squad and fixing a lot of appliances. The people there were usually very welcoming anf kind. A great place to work"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,This is a great job to have when you are younger. If you are into video games or technology in general then working here is for you. If you are able to get a position in electronics you will love it because you get to talk about the things you enjoy most and explain it to someone who might not know as much as you.
good,"High pressure sales environment. They promote from within rarely, but I have seen it happen. Other than that, you stand around, answer questions from customers and ring them up. Not too difficult. Pays pretty well compared to other retail jobs though. They offered me more than I asked on my application."
good,One of the best jobs I've had. Excellent training opportunities and management is amazing.  Customers are some of the nicest people I've ever met. Work was always a pleasure
good,"Fast paced, goal orientated work environment.Great training if you take advantage of the online learning. Friendly and helpful coworkers. To be successful you must be able to meet goals."
good,Was a very family friendly crew loved working with them. Met a bunch of new people who cared about making sure your home life and work life were well balanced.
good,"Flexible hours ability to make customers happy. Training is available, have to want to learn about other tech, but all Geek Squad training is mandatory"
good,Great company to work for! The atmosphere is great laid back you can work at your own pace not a stressful job at all! great money for the work that is given!
good,"Customer service is the name of the game, when working at Best Buy expect to be bullied with unrealistic expectations by both customers and employers."
good,"Best Buy is the ideal place for young adults to begin or enhance their work experience. If desired, one could choose to pursue higher positions and start a career with this company."
good,While on the Geek Squad I was able to troubleshoot a myriad of problems. Anything from broken sound systems to console games and phones quite often. Most common were desktop/laptop issues and repairs. My favorite was when I got to upgrade hardware components for my clients.
good,"Selected desktop, laptop, and tablet computers based on customers’ needs and financial budget. Built rapport with customers and provided professional guidance on computer requirements and accessories."
good,"Okay place to work. Met great people, learned a lot while there. Wish management was a bit more understanding but other than that overall ok experience."
good,"Always seemed to be an upbeat place to work, The job gave the hours i needed even though i was a part timer, but that is where the problem stemmed from with me wanting to find another job, I was always promised full time, I always hit their goals and their requirements to be promoted and they never kept up their end. It's a very egocentric place, the managers only want their employees to shine so they can bonus. not to help the lower tier employees climb up and better them selves within the company, hence why they have a horrible turn over rate"
good,Fun environment to work and people are really helpful. I like the agile environment where you can run around and get the work done at much faster pace.
good,"Good place work, good people."
good,"I worked here while in between jobs.  It was fine.  People are good.  Job is easy.  Not a career for me, but don't mind it at all. Will work here until I find a permanent job."
good,this was one of my very first jobs and i loved it. this is a great place for someone looking for their first job. it is not over complicated. just do what you are asked and everything will go smoothly.
good,"The company engenders a culture of excellent, but also has an overwhelming retail air. Despite actually being a retailer, it expects its employees to give a level of service that goes beyond retail, while only paying them a retail rate and treating them like retail employees. This is especially true in the service department (known as Geek Squad). While employed with them I routinely performed highly level IT services that would have been billed out at approximately $125/hr by any certified technical entity, but since it was considered within my job duties was only paid $14.78/hr."
good,"It was alright,  felt like I did a lot more than what I was getting paid to do, but a good experience. It might have been just the store I worked at, but wasn't a fan of quotas."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,It was a great place to work.  It was nice to help people out with trying to pick the right product for them.  I was able to work independently as well as with a group.
good,"Best Buy is a very good company to work for.  They respect all of their employees equally.  If you like diversity, this is the place to work."
good,"Fast Pace environment."
good,"Great place to work for a first time job, great place to gain customer service. Can move around to a lot of different departments."
good,there is a lot of down time and some of the management is hard to deal with but if you can get over that it can be a fun place to work. getting training can be hard. they will find where thy like you and then that will be were you stay.
good,discount was amazing working with best buy. Compensation is a little above minimum wage and not much difference applied when being given a raise. Not much room for growth most employees stay in role for extended periods of time
good,I really enjoyed working for Best Buy. Management was very good at keeping everyone on the ball to what is happen. Management worked hard which makes me work harder. Excellent training.
good,"This was a fun job, it was challenging because it was right around "
good,This Best Buy was a great fun place to work! The manager at the time was very open laid back made it fun to work there. Learn a lot while I was there.
good,"The company offered alot of products and services which made all our clients happy. I offered the best customer service possible, but the company had a lack of management, and knowledge in their department. I had no problem filling the gaps on any aspect, loved teaching coworkers and clients about the latest and greatest technologies"
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed staying current on all of the latest tech while helping customers improve their experience with whatever brought them in. I was responsible for sales in Home Theater, Magnolia Home Theater, Appliances, Media, Gaming and Car Audio. Taught Sales proficiency and leadership skills to store employees looking to grow."
good,"Unfortunately Best Buy is a place where it is hard to progress through the ranks. If you're a cashier, plan to be at that post for about 5 years before you're on the floor assisting customers."
good,I enjoyed my time here but the overt plugs to buy into the company were just too much at times. The atmosphere was ideal but when product was not selling there was pressure put on employees to perform but the area we worked in was not that affluent
good,"Best Buy is one of Canada’s largest and most successful retailers, operating the Best Buy (www.bestbuy.ca), Best Buy Mobile, and Geek Squad (www.geeksquad.ca) brands. The Company offers consumers a unique shopping experience with the latest technology and entertainment products, plus an expanded assortment of lifestyle products offered through www.bestbuy.ca, at the right price, with a no-pressure (non-commissioned) sales environment."
good,"very well balanced company , cares about the workplace and what it takes to be successful. training and compensation could be better but the company is growing and moving in the right direction"
good,"I liked the company but it gave me more insight on how to work with smart television's and other electronics "
good,"i think working here all depends on what kind of managers you get, it can be either having fun while working or hating every second of being at work"
good,The Agents I work with have an incredible bond. I appreciate each of my co workers for what they have to offer. The hardest part of the job is all of the operational setbacks that affect our Clients.
good,Walmart is a great place to work but they sometimes do not want to work with your schedule and it is very hard to move to a higher pay grade within the store.
good,"I educate the average consumer about technological devices."
good,"Everyday I would come into work and get ready to sell Tv's or anything any customer needed help with figuring out what will suit their personal needs. I would also re-stock the floor if needed on downtime. Co-workers are all nice fun people. Management is good, they are all nice people."
good,Good job. Had fun everyday that I work. People are cool and fun to be around. Wish I could have done more during my time there.
good,"Productive days of working."
good,"Worked with the company for almost 2 years,. IMy coworkers are great. Feel I could be doing so much more if allowed in order to help my store be more successful"
good,Job security is well as long as duties are performed as expected. Minimum wage pay can be difficult to advance. Developed a lot of knowledge about cell phones and cameras. Learned excellent customer service and sales skills.
good,Great company to work for with great company values. While there is constant change in brick and mortar stores the company does what is necessary to keep their doors open and change with the times.
good,Great employee benefits. Slightly above average retail pay. Decent Management. Some room for career advancement. Good job for high school and college students.
good,"Great place to learn and develop selling and customer service skills, Co workers make it a fun environment, management works with your schedule and train you in any position."
good,"I was a sales associate, and constantly answering questions for customers. I met some great people there, I wouldn't take it back."
good,"Cool place to work, learn a lot of new things. I would not go back though. Poor management, major budget cuts. Its a good stepping stone."
good,"A solid company with strong values and competitive pay in the retail space. Technology focus makes it a fun and rapidly-changing sales environment; customers are shopping for things they want and are excited to buy, which makes for a better employee experience and a positive environment."
good,A typical day at work would be were you would take care of customer's problem and checking them out so they can go home quick. The managers are nice and some they don't get along with you because you can tell by how their body language is. The hardest part of the job is when the customer storms in to yell at you and get you all mad when you try to stay calm and be professional.
good,Best Buy is a very good place to work and also a great place learn new technologies. Working at Best Buy provided lot of opportunities to enhance my skill and knowledge.
good,Great place to gain experience and knowledge. Very fast paced and high expectations. Customer facing 100% of the time and expectations were very clear.
good,Best Buy is an okay company. I believe working in my city it hindered me on seeing it's true potential. If you are looking to start a career in the retail business then that would be a great place to start
good,This was a fun company to work for. It was fast paced and during the holidays the customers kept you engaged with their needs. Technology always changing so it was always something to do and learn.
good,This biggest problem with this company was the lack of move up room. it was a good start and a good experience but I felt like I wasn't going anywhere in this job.
good,"Fun place to work for. Provide personalized service and exceptional expertise for customers."
good,best buy and sears repair centers were the larger repair centers in greater colorado area for a long time. good learning environment and opportunities for personal and career growth.
good,It was nice helping the back end. Sometimes we were under staffed which made it hard to catch up to seasonal demands. I would work there again as a supervisor.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,it was a cool job but you have to kiss a** to stay. they play favoritism. if you can deal with that then go for it. you get great deal on the products.
good,"En el tiempo que estuve trabajando para la empresa fue muy agradable, el ambiente es bueno y tienen facilidad de horarios para estudiantes, capacitacion constante de acuerdo a lo necesario para el empleo."
good,Best buy provides outstanding training and benefits for its workers. My time at bestbuy taught me a lot about costumer service and product sales. i would definitely recommend anyone to apply to Best Buy.
good,"- Fast, Productive and good"

good,"At Best Buy I started my job selling video games and then was moved to the warehouse where most of my experience is. I enjoyed the people that I worked with and unloading trucks and restocking the floor sounds terribly boring, but when you worked with the crew that I did it was a blast every truck night."
good,"For being my first job, Best Buy was a great place to be employed. Scheduling is very flexible, management was good, and the environment was always busy. There was never a dull day at Best Buy. You also learn how to approach different types of people and it helps with selling skills."

It is a fast paced, ever-changing world in which you have to continually stay on top of the latest and greatest electronics and solutions out there. It is certainly demanding, but at the same time, fun to continually strive to stay current and knowledgeable. I've learned a lot about what it means to provide exceptional customer service as well and really finding out a customers needs and turning it into a solution for them. "
good,good discounts of the products offered .... if you are looking to have your weekend off look some where else ...it is a great place to become tech savy

good,The people are the best part about this job. This job completely relies on teamwork and communication. Hardest part of this job are the rushes and some management issues. Management issues completely depend on location. The major thing I learned while working there is to overcome your fears and develop excellent customer service skills.

good,"The culture behind Geek Squad makes it feel a bit more than your average tech job. A job title of Agent, a legit badge; if nothing else it makes it a bit more fun. The job is fast paced, and has greatly expanded my computer knowledge. Being in a retail environment, I feel like a lot of customers feel much more entitled than if they were at a sole computer repair facility. Lots of ""I bought this here"" ""Do you know how much I spend in this store?"" as if I'm just supposed to spit on the guy next to them because he spent less."
good,It's a nice play to work. They train you on the products and they provide plenty of opportunities for growth in the company. If you like working with the latest gadgets and enjoy retail I recommend try out best buy.

good,"This job provided me with a atmosphere that was easy to work in and allowed to put my skills to use. Typical day was rather trying to investigate internal or external theft, or working the in the warehouse. The hardest part of the job was on occasion not getting enough hours to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was the whole staff and working together."
good,"Best buy as a company is great, they give great benefits and make sure the employees have good discounts and rewards within the company.  The best buy I worked for was nice because it was a small one but I would say as far as management goes they do have room for improvement."
good,"I like best buy a lot, because from every other relate store I hear nightmarish story of how they treat the employees. but bestbuy is different i felt like one family with a exception of a few people i grit my teeth and worked with."
good,loved working at BBY. the value and staff created a great work experience. trainings are GREAT! recognition of employees is great as well

From employees to customers, I've learned a lot about social skills and what it means to genuinely want to give great customer service. The managers here are fair and I enjoy working with each of them. The most enjoyable part of this job is that I know how to do it pretty well. The hardest part about my job is having to deal with not getting that many hours due to Best Buy Market not having much to give to each of their workers."
good,"best buy is not something I would do again base off their communication skills"
good,"The people I work with are great and for the most part really step up and pull their weight when it comes to getting things done on time and in a organized fashion. I sincerely enjoy working with the people that I work with. Management pushes you to improve, but not so much that you feel over worked and/or pushed to the edge. "
good,"Greeted customers, answered phones, assisted customers with product issues "
good,Pay is low. Fun place to work if you're a high school  or college student. Pay is minimum wage. Healthcare is really expensive. Not a lot of room to grow.

good,"Best Buy is a good employer, the co-workers are friendly and extremely helpful, and management is very respectful to the staff.  It's busy in the fall and winter, but really dwindles in the spring.  All in all a good job for a student or young person, but I needed more hours.  I was sad to go, as I loved the people I worked with.  But I may go back in Nov to work seasonal to help with Black Friday, Christmas, and Boxing Week."

good,Very easygoing feeling at least at the store I worked at. Management is open and understanding and usually readily available. Most of the employees foster and enjoy a sense of fun and camaraderie. Sales goals per dept vary incredibly though and some are entirely unreasonable making it hard to bonus and maintain your required sales per hour.
good,"-Communicated well with others"
good,Provides a great opportunity for growth. Customer satisfaction and employee engagement is part of the everyday rhythm.
good,"Interacting with customers, resolving issues. Making sure the customer feels heard will keep them coming back.  Management needs to value their employees more, as for my co-workers when we work as team it benefits the company on a whole."
good,The job is a great job. My only complaints is that I have been wrote up for things I never did and also wrote up for things that a individual should have been briefed on the spot about not days or even weeks later. But besides that it feels like a family environment and everybody gets along pretty well.
good,Further developed my customer service and overall people skills. I gained extensive experience in ensuring customers had a great shopping experience at Best Buy.
good,I had the opportunity to travel and even relocate.  Lots of customer interaction and lots of neat products available. Seeing new entertainment technology as soon as it came out was nice.
good,"Nice friendly environment, coworkers are cool. Fast paced on some days, can be slow on others. It all depends on which department you work in. No commission either"
good,Very enjoyable work environment that allows you to have fun while being the best. There is constant training to improve your skills in selling. Good work life balance.
good,"The typical day is pretty routine, cleaning and organizing your department along with verifying your demos are displaying correctly and checking if any new models were released. I've learned a lot about technology through E learnings, from how computers really work to the difference in washer machines and headphones. One thing i noticed about management is they tend to fill those positions from outside of the store, not to much in store position raises. The hardest part of the job would be working with frustrated guest. The most enjoyable part i would have to say are the employee accommodations and discounts."
good,This place is one of the only second homes I got and I really enjoyed it. I honestly loved working for them and I would have never asked for no other first customer service/retail experience. Great team and great deals.

good,"Typically at work have to juggle multiple customers however there is not much support to handle each individual customer especially since we pride and offer individual service for that particular customer's needs. It can be very exhausting at times, but sometimes the challenge is worth it. Management is great. They work just as hard as those on the floor. My departmental manager is wonderful. He supports and encourage me as a sale Microsoft Expert. Co-worker are friendly, however we do not work well as unit to deliver product efficiently as we could.The most enjoyable part is interacting with customers want to find the right solution for them."
good,"when you read the need for the customer it will make different with you ,when you get the right thing to the customers, because customers some time want you to do the thinking for them and that was my very good area to do"
good,"Best Buy Canada has great customer service, as an employee I have seen first hand how associates and managers deal with customers to provide the best shopping experience they can.

The management were awesome especially my manager  n my department, my co-workers made the work environment so easy to work with, did everything together as a team (team work).

What I enjoyed most was the customer i mean you get to see different kind of people everyday and being able to help them with their needs."

good,Been with Best Buy for about 2 years and a half.

good,"my job is the typical retail sales job , but now I am stop at pay rate that I cant increase until a supervisor spot opens up. so I am applying now to better myself and put myself in a career changing position"
good,"I genuinely enjoy the environment and the people.  The commercial branch, BBFB, operates a bit outside of the core operations which makes for some frustrations and seemingly unneccesary challenges.  Management is hit and miss.  Inspirational VP.  There are some incredible people that will continue to rise through the ranks and then there are a few questionable leaders that are probably holding some talent down. The compensation structure is pretty poor but manageable."

The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to achieve goals above the stores past performances.

good,"It takes passion to be able to work here. If you enjoy the culture you will do fine. the culture of Geek Squad is amazing as long as you let it and best buy management will leave you alone. Understand that Best Buy and Geek Squad might be one company but they are very different. Working here you will start off in your crucible but if you make it to a good position pay, hours, and job will become infinitely better. But dealing with the bad pay, horrible hours, and retail work life balance can get very frustrating very quickly. It takes heart and determination to get anywhere, and its not for everyone."

good,"The employees were very helpful and nice. The management staff was not very professional, but there were two or three people that were."
good,"I was thrown into this position and did not get much training until after 3months of being there. Once training started it was a lot to learn in such a short time. I took notes and reference online training courses. I was in charge of an all male staff, which at first was daunting as I was criticized for my physical strength. Once the boys saw that i could lift anything they could all was well!"
good,"Easy Shifts for new highers,"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job at Best Buy would be, being able to meet new people. Each with there own thoughts and opinions over certain topics and items.

To be successful, one has to be very well at handling multiple amount of customers while being able to cater to theirs needs. Its a fast paced environment so your have to be decisive and make quick and accurate judgments. The skills I learned at Best Buy almost are more important that some of the techniques I learned in the classroom."

My co-workers are all well rounded individuals with years of experience and a willing to help you if you become stuck or run into an issue. The hardest part of the day is still maintaining productivity when we have an extremely busy day or someone has to call out. The most enjoyable part is the physicality behind pc repair as well as working with my co-workers.

good,Great environment to work in with great punctual people that love to help out. Great beginning job that provides many benefits and opportunities for your future.

good,"The people that I worked with were great. I learned a lot about electronics, merchandising, truck, warehouse procedures, inventory control and security."
good,"Lots of unhappy customers to deal with, but as long as you're ok with that you will enjoy it - good people/management, good location (gym canteen subway greggs) but poor in terms of being rewarded for good service to them - don't get praised, only criticised when applicable. Politics make it difficult to get the few positions/secondments that do arise."
good,"I needed something with more balanced hours. One year I made 30,000 and the next I made 25000  we unloaded trucks sorted merchandise and and received it and then stocked it. management always was involved and seemed to care.

good,My experience at Best Buy was terrific. I had excellent managers and coworkers. I made a few lifelong friends. I was expected to work independently as well as in team projects. Pay was hourly with bonuses based on performance. This required me to work on my interpersonal skills and improve my customer service habits.

good,"Enjoyed getting up and going to work everyday, I knew i would learn something new or something would make my day. MY co-workers we're very friendly and welcoming.

It is a very well managed company that does value its employees. Most positions are performance driven as well."

good,"A typical day at best buy is very fun and fast paced. I learned about different type of electronics, and I enjoyed helping the customers to the best to my ability. The management team were very pleasant."
good,I enjoyed working for Best Buy.  The managers were caring and held high standards for their employees.  They push their employees to be more than just employees that stand around and help when asked.
good,"I loved working with my Geek Squad team.  They were the reason I looked forward to work everyday.  There was always a portion of the day where everyone shared a laugh.  Best days were Fridays because of the wacky gimmicks of the day, like Crazy Hat Day."
good,"working at best buy with out a doubt the most interesting job i have ever had so far, everytime I would make a mistake whether it be big or small, my managers and co-workers are always there to encourage me to do better next and are very helpful when I am in need of help, it was  very encouraging place to be at."
good,"Great workplace, great management! The project team is responsible for setting planograms to the merchandizing standard. I learned how to troubleshoot electronics and how to set up a laptop for display."
good,Best Buy was a great experience for me as a sales professional. I was able to work with 3 main wireless providers as well as learn about all the other new technology that out.
good,"Requires a lot of product knowledge, you must keep up otherwise you won't be able to close sales. On a typical day you will talk to probably 200-500 people, and sell to about half of them in order to make your daily and monthly quotas."
good,I would assist customers with any help needed. I would re stock shelves or work at cashier. The co-workers and managers were really fun to work with.
good,"Best Buy is a job that one could be proud of saying they work at. Always providing the latest and greatest in electronics and staying ahead of their competitors, Best Buy provides it's own style of Customer Service, because as an employee, you are given the chance to introduce customers to the newest and greatest pieces of technology; along with services that will last them a long time."
good,"great company and stock options were awesome."
good,Company has a good benefits package for full time employees.  Work life balance is not ideal.  Management is fair to employees. Hourly positions are ideal for singles with little family obligations. Co-workers created a family type environment within the store.
good,come in and just ring people out and answer customer questions and everybody just keeps to themselves and isn't always much help
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The best part about any day at Best Buy is the technology.  There's something great about finding new solutions to problems that customers have.  Most co-workers are reasonably qualified; supervisors and managers are energetic and understanding.  Everyone learns how to communicate effectively at Best Buy.  Everyone is trained and no one is reprimanded for not meeting quotas and deadlines without looking at training first.
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work, we really care about our customer experience and overall quality as a team together. Management helps greatly with support and will teach you how to be better. Co- workers and environment has been great. Have learned a lot as a tech and sales person, enough to be recognized as one of the top in the district. Overall great work environment and fun to strive to be a better employee."
good,Best Buy has a lot of different incentive programs and the other associates are easy to get along with. However it is difficult to move upwards.
good,"I enjoyed working at Best Buy. I got along well with my managers and coworkers. It was rewarding to meet some of the challenges and it was interesting to learn the new technologies and to teach it to others but I knew that I would not have been happy working in a retail setting. Daily, I would explain features of the mobile devices and the providers to customers."
good,"Company was enjoyable, gained valuable experience to help me forward my career. Most enjoyable part of the job was the sales commission system"
good,"-Our expertise were always challenged and we as a team loved a good challenge"
good,When you are just a sales associate managers will treat you like dirt to save themselves. Expected to work hard yet hardly gain recognition for going above and beyond.
good,"Best buy is not a bad place to work, work to life balance is good and if certain criterias are met there are bonuses.  Working holiday hours wasn't always fun but you get that with any retail place you work."
good,I enjoyed my time at Best Buy while i was in Lewisville. The discounts you get are totally worth it. Although i was at cashier and did not get any chance to move out onto the floor during my time there. The break room was great and had full Direct TV. Lunches were too short at 30 minutes though. The co-workers were great and i enjoyed the people i work with
good,"Friendly culture and fair work although pay is not great. Variety of learning opprotunities, nice environment , good management and business structure."
good,"Started with Geek Squad City in 2007 as a computer repair technician, was promoted to team leader within 1 year and then supervisor in 2 more years. Eventually becoming the Repair floor service manager in Oct of 2014. Managed a work force of over 120 employees and 7 supervisors. I held the responsibility of opening and closing the facility, managing to goal all my teams with metrics of productivity, quality, customer satisfaction, employee engagement and business cost through P&L. Responsible for talent acquisition and performance/behavior accountability. Responsible for working as a team with other leaders to manage process and policy for a facility of 100+ million dollars annually and a work force of over 1000 employees. Learned a tremendous amount about leading people and also myself. Worked with some amazing people and was able to be actively involved in creation of several processes that saved millions of dollars to the company. Gave GSC almost 10 years of my life and I have to say the journey was fulfilling, educational and successful."
good,"The job was fine, but when you have a lazy crew it was terrible to come into work. I learned a lot that about computers working there. More technical things than anything. The management was ok. The hardest part of the job was picking up where someone left off and no work was done. The enjoyable part was working with certain people."
good,I have been here for 6+ years and I enjoy my work a great deal. My co-workers are very nice and helpful. There is room to excel and promotion within the company.
good,everyday was fun and exciting. I learned how to organize the store settings. To perform inventory on all merchandise. My co-workers was the best.
good,good for starting job lots of learning and good job for experience. Not the best co-worker experience but overall good place.
good,Flexible hours. Great staff. Good pay. Good training for customer service relations. Room for growth and promotion. Various departments to work in.
good,"I didn't learn much as I already knew how to be a cashier"
good,A typical day at work involved helping customers needs and aiming to satisfy management's sales objectives. You learn how to sell to an extent but mostly how to deal with customers and think on your feet.
good,A typical day started off with me signing into the system and getting started on processing and assessing product for the buyback program. Throughout the day I made a quota of product I processed and assessed. I solely was in the trade in department where I dealt with the reimbursement of money to customers who were trading in their electronics for money. I determined how much they would be reimbursed.
good,"Learned about TV's, home theater products, and appliances while being able to relay this information to customers. Management was easy to access and affable as well. Coworkers were always abreast with new product information."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Reinstalling,testing and troubleshooting laptops,PCs,Macbook,ipods,ipad,CUSTOMER COMPLAIN HANDLING etc.Hardest part was to lift up the laptop boxes.Sometimes it was too heavy."
good,"I go in at 7 AM and put my phones music on some of the equipment out back. I immediately check our in-store queue to see which computer has been there the longest and then I start working on that one. Two hours go by and then my first co-worker comes in to meet me. He's the Operations agent in charge of shipping and receiving. Me and him always strike up a conversation. Before I know it, I have closed many tags and it is already 3 PM. This job has taught me much about computers that I didn't already know. I removed virus, I fix just about any issue you can think of. I work with Laptop, tower and all in one hardware. Including Apple products. I do data transfers in an orderly fashion to avoid data breaches. All while loving every second of it."
good,What can be said it is retail through and through. Accommodating with your schedule you will work hard assisting customers and doing a little bit of just about everything else in the store.
good,"Awesome place to work and training is awesome. Great at rewarding employees for great performance."
good,"Initially the management was an excellence source of encouragement and motivation for the sales floor team. The culture was fun and upbeat, although the pay was sub par for the amount of work done (as is the case with any retailer). After a shift in management, the fun inspiring culture was all but gone and thus the job was no longer worth the pay. Someone best suited for this job would be an individual who knows the product, loves dealing with people and easily lets things roll off their back. All and all it was a great experience and I really enjoyed selling."
good,enjoyed the atmosphere of the store as well as the Co-Workers. wasn't my favorite job but it is definitely listed in the places that I would work again
good,"Manage a team, oversee construction and electricians during various projects. Book travel for my team and orchestrate the"
good,"I would say that this company is one of the hardest companies to work for. The location I worked at threw me around to different sections before training me in those area's and then asked me why I wasn't trained in that department. I did like the coworkers that I worked with but the supervisors really had a god complex. The supervisor I had would tell me to do five things at once and expect them all to be done in two minutes tops. Everyone was helpful when I needed a helping hand or a question and friends are easily made during your employment. The hardest part of the job was asking a customer to answer a few questions and for them to give out their number and address for the survey. The supervisors pushed this so hard that customers sometimes were enraged or upset at how much they pushed them. They were basic questions like ""What game consoles do you own,"" and things in that regard but it was a whole page of questions. If you didn't get those survey's done, you got written up, and if the supervisor didn't like you, he would find every chance to write you up. That was the most horrid experience I've ever had working in sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around the technology and making friends with your coworkers, was a great environment."
good,"I had worked for the Geek Squad very close to its inception. When I started there it wasn't that I was just looking for a job but to be part of this team. That was several years ago. I have made life long friends working there but there were people who just caused issues and were flakes that made life terrible sometimes. I had some great supervisors and some that should have been fired a long time ago. Overall I recommend that if you can get the work  do it. Seeing someone that was devastated that they had lost everything but I was able to really help them in that moment gave me great joy. Yes it's a numbers game, yes you deal with shady people. But if you are honest and truly have a mindset of wanting to help people it can really be a good place to work."
good,I worked part-time as a cashier and I sometimes helped in the warehouse restocking the shelves. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and the most enjoyable time was working during the holidays. Customers can be entertaining when they are shopping.
good,"There is always something to do, I am never bored task wise. Culture differs per location but is generally good. There's a niche for every style of work somewhere within the Company."
good,"Learned how to sell one on one and large groups, learned about sales projections, and monitoring. Talking to customers was a really fun part of the job"
good,"good for college students, flexible schedules and friendly staff managers. "
good,"Working at best buy is an awesome experience at first. However, performing at your highest potential, it is never enough to complete monthly task set by supervisors. making growth and promotion difficult and up to the managers and supervisors discretion."
good,"Days consisted of reviewing previous days performance, developing strategies for product launches, in the moment coaching and trainings. Communications between General Manager and peers to work with and resolve customer disappoints. There was a consistent message that was conveyed, and that's to provide a world class shopping experience to every customer every time. The team was the best part of the job. The most difficult part of the job was not being able to provide the complete solution for the customer in store at that moment."
good,Everyone is fun and nice and love working there. Lots of new product with being the first to see and learn about. There are many tasks that I do here with merchandising and leading.
good,"Customer Service Associate in Portable Electronics Department: Duties included running register, maintaining planogram workspace, meeting sales quotas, customer service pertaining to enquiries regarding merchandise including cameras, camcorders, iPods, MP3 players, car audio (radios, speakers, subwoofer, amplifiers and GPS systems), as well as unloading merchandise truck and stocking department.   "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job for me is being able to go into the clients house and help them finish their dream that they envisioned
good,"Different from a Big Box store, in a Stand Alone Store we are responsible for a lot of things on our own.  Taking on the assistant manager role is like a Manager on Duty in a Big Box store. Lots of responsibility in assisting and helping the manager run the business better. Job requirements includes all the operational work, back office, ordering supplies, paper work, filing them neatly and properly, auditing, inventory control, receiving new inventory and shipping defectives out.

good,Talented company and looks very good on your resume. Help develop people into leaders and gives them the essentials to do so
good,"It is a busy company, my store is always busy and the most of customers are from Brazil. I have a very good management, very good trainers and co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is being with the customers and help them with their needs. And the hardest part is when is not busy we still have to sell more."
good,"I spend my days assisting customers, trying to create the best experience for them while also being sure to create the best workplace ever for my employees."
good,Great place to work with great ethics and customer satisfaction. Very knowledgable employees and always willing to help when needed.
good,"Work life balance is garbage, the company is undergoing a ton of changes and its hard to know where you stand. I think in comparison to other retailers its ok but needs to have more balance,"
good,"At best buy I was educated on how to sell computers, camera, MP3 players, and accessary products. The focus was to educate people on the products and find the best solutions to their electronic needs. The management was wonderful in regards to this because they were never too strict or to lack in the progress of their employees. We always worked towards best solutions possible to any need with either customers or fellow co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was always seeing old customers come into the store and thank you for setting them up with the best products. Customers were always very thankful and appreciative but always had further questions."
good,It was a good place to work had great discount and you could win good prizes. Had good training and look of feed back. Job security was not that great win the company was doing bad.
good,You work with some of the best people that you will ever meet. If you work hard and want a job that challenges you mentally and allows you to make decision on your own without a managers direct supervision then this is the job for you.

good,Enjoy working there because of the people I work with. It can be frustrating at some points because of the customers and other employees.
good,In this company they expect more and more as you complete your projects. and i would say great learning curve with less personal life. environment is great with few bullies.
good,Sales was great because peers was great to work with. Management could use more directive approach to helping peer development
good,In charge of answering phone calls and do paper work of online products we have in store that customer order online making sales and customers needs of getting their product they want and going that extra mile for the customer making our goals.
good,"Fun place to work at as your first retail job! You will meet different people and come across new people everyday. I worked in the front end, so I got to be on the register and stand all day."

good,"fun place to work always had a good time."
good,I really enjoy the work environment. My co-workers are fun and easy to work with. Managers are super flexible and laid back.
good,co-workers are really great and knowledgeable. A typical day at work is very busy and time flies because of that. Work space is pretty small but I believe its due to the fact that the original store plan did not plan on having a Geek Squad Precinct.
good,"Good company with strong values, rewards hard work and sales abilities"
good,Hours were flexible. Management was very well formed. Also kept employees very well informed. I enjoyed working with my co workers.
good,"fun place to work.  not much else to say.  Great discounts, sell stuff"
good,"Very fun place to work, not a busy store, sell, sell, sell no incentive for average employee. The raises as I was led to believe were only up to 25cents. Then when I heard other employees were offered alot higher, and thats not performance based thats favortism"
good,This company is a good company to work for but instead of honoring employees who deserve the recognition they don't give phase. I have learned that keep working no matter the praise and not to worry about any one else.
good,Have to have product knowledge in order to have an intelligent conversation with customers. Customers will try to test your knowledge on a weekly basis.

I learned an impressive amount from co-workers and customers alike. I grew professionally and personally from my tenure here. The job while difficult at times, has molded me into an eminent figure in the electronics world."
good,"Its been good to me for the most part. I have fun some days, other days are stressful. Most people don't know what they're are doing but it happens everywhere."
good,Great job if you like building relationships with employees and customers
good,With strong management to provide support to their workers everyone feels like they are making a difference towards a common goal. A fantastic place to work.
good,seasonal position at best buy working in the mobile department. It was a crazy environment around the holidays but that is to be expected. Having to work 3rd shift was not fun thanksgiving night.

good,"Count money drawers "
good,"overall good company, very poor leadership.  great benefits"
good,People constantly made the same mistakes selling installation and it was a constant battle with customers over what was paid for and what was extra. I was forced to rip people off and sell them garbage they didn't need in order to maintain productivity high and have the numbers my boss wanted to keep me around working. Management was poor and clueless to what they were actually managing.
good,This was an overall great place to work.  The environment was never boring but it was still conducive to a great work day.
good,"Geek Squad is one of the few service departments at Best Buy. That means I can focus less on the numbers and more on providing efficient, quality service. Of course, that doesn't stop the angry customers from coming to the store and treating you like sheet, but it's very rewarding when people are appreciative of your service. Most repairs are routine--running a bunch of diagnostics, malware removal (lots of it), hard drive replacements, new pc setups, etc--but some are a little more tricky. The store I currently work at is somewhat understaffed, so despite my job being a repair tech, I often have to check clients in/out, consult, and help take care of shipping stuff at the end of the day. Being able to multitask helps me tremendously and knowing how to prioritize is probably the most important aspect of the job."
good,The company is trying to survive in this economy and in the struggling highly competitive industry.
good,"The first thing I did was check e-mail for fixes or known issues. After this, I was talking to stores about issues they were encountering. The solution would range from education to restoring a whole network. I enjoyed the fast pace of this job. A lot of calls would happen and a lot of issues would happen as well. Sometimes burning out could happen but our supervisor was good with giving us breaks to recoup."
good,"How busy the day was depended on the time of year, weather, if there was a sale etc."
good,"Open registered in the morning shift at 8am.  Each day, strived to meet the sale goals given from the supervisor. Provided fast and friendly check out at registers as well as answered phone and directed calls. The management constantly had one-on-ones with cashiers at the front to compliment there strengths and acknowledge their weaknesses which became very helpful."
good,"flexible hours"
good,"A typical day of work, I will find myself processing sales, dealing with returns, selling product protection and financial services.  I have learned many things in my time at Best Buy including: selling skills, customer service, and processing complex sales.  My management team at Best Buy is great. They are rewarding and aim to provide a great work experience for everyone.  The hardest part of my job would be dealing with irate customers and finding them the right solutions while staying collected.  The most enjoyable part to my job is making people's day by fixing an issue or finding a solution to their problem."
good,I engage clients to educate them on their technology needs as well as repair their devices. I also support the sales and customer service teams during high traffic hours.
good,This was a special job for me because it was my first management job ever
good,"help customers , ring out products, stock shelf, locate products"
good,"A day is filled with constant work, and enjoyable coworkers. I learned team work is extremely important in the success of our every day responsibilities. Our management lacks the knowledge in utilizing their employees to there best abilities. My coworkers are a pleasure to work with we help each other in anyway we can always. The mass amount of work we have to do everyday with a minimum amount of staff to get it done with. Being able to work with the people I work with an enjoying my team accomplishments."
good,"I bounced all over the store and worked in many different departments. My main job was Geek Squad - Home theater installs. I loved going out to customers homes and setting up their home theater systems even when the hours were long. The company definitely makes you feel appreciated. One store meeting we had a Guitar Hero contest for a prize. The coworkers and management were always down to earth and friendly. The General Manager that I had when I worked there was strict but fair. If you did not know how to do something, he would take the time out to show you how to. Great guy. One of those jobs where they feel more like family than coworkers."
good,This job was a wonderful experience for me to get as close to an office setting while attending college. Help me prepare for other job opportunities.
good,"None.  It's Best Buy.  I was a great employee, and I worked hard."
good,Engaging interactions and chance to make a difference in someone's entertainment experience.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"It's a productive place but i dont like the pay, and i dont get any hours."
good,For a retail job they take good care of employees and try to work with you as much as possible especially if you are still in school.
good,"Repair computers, help the customers, run a register, and clean the work area. I've takent classes on repairing computer, installing home theater systems, installing hardware and software, and restoring computers to factory settings. Management and my Co-workers where really nice and fun to be around we had alot of fun at this job, we were always haveing a good day there. The hardest part of this job was working in retail during certin days of the year. The most enjoyable part was just about every thing but helping the customers and repairing their problems with the computers."
good,"Both positions I have been in have been rewarding in different ways. In store is a great way to build relationships that will last through your time with the company. While as a dispatcher, I was able to develop more of my time management and high level problem solving skills. Any location I have been my fellow employees have been great."
good,Best Buy was a great place to work. Lots of good perks to the job and great people to work along side.

good,"Even though I was seasonal help, I felt like it could have been a great opportunity to advance if I would have stayed."
good,"I loved working for Best Buy until the last set of changes that took out all the managers.  Our store lost our GM at the same time so we had all new management and I didn't morally agree with the  way the store was being ran. BUT before that, I LOVED my job. I guess it depends on who you work for and/or with, but I loved my coworkers and for the most part, thoroughly enjoyed working for Best Buy. The employee discount is a pretty awesome perk!"
good,"Overall good experience, had fun, plenty of perks.  Good training on products and services."
good,"Had fun, great co-workers, heavy lifting, improved customer interaction skills, not far from home (saved a lot on gas.) Excellent facilities."
good,"Create work orders and support the customer. We remove malware, install hardware and software, setup new computers and consult customers in their technology needs."
good,"A day starts with a small meeting between the manager and the sales people. You will be briefed on the store targets on that day. After that its all selling and helping customer get their stuff. Its fun yet annoying sometimes specially those difficult customers. I just wish Best Buy gives more incentives to employees, Other than that, Best Buy is a good place to work with."
good,the focus at Best Buy is to attain and retain customer through customer service and brand loyalty
good,"Its a good company to work for especially if your still in school. you will learn a lot, and they treat their employees great. the management is pretty good and fair. over all its a good place to work in."

good,A typical day consists of helping customers and restocking the sales floor and also undergoing training for new plans and new devices being released.
good,"Busy place to work, great staff and opportunity to work with diverse people. Great place to develop customer service skills"
good,"The title just about says it all.  It's a great place to work, but I just wish the Morgantown location would pay more."
good,Just like any retail store with a fun environment and occasional micromanagement.
good,"I Worked in asset protection at the DC in shepherdsville ky. I enjoyed the work and the co-workers. Average day was spent monitoring CCTV, checking employees and visitors in and out. And checking tractor trailers in and out."
good,"Great work environment, the hours however unless your full time are subject to severe cuts if sales are low."
good,"retail"
good,Working in Geek Squad really tests your knowledge and customer service. Its easy to explain something technical to someone in the industry. Trying to explain something to an everyday person starts to escalate difficulty.
good,"My day consisted of organizing the department, and making sure the staff in our department were up to date on their training materials. I also took care of customer needs everyday during my shift."
good,"I already filled a review out for this company, please see it for more informations."
good,I worked at Best Buy while I was in college and it was an extremely fun job. It is a typical retail job that doesn't pay that well but the job cultural is great!
good,"Demanding work for such little pay. Great company to work for and a lot of benefits, but pay was less than sub par"
good,"A typical day consisted of answer customer questions over the phone as well as in person, putting items on hold for customer, and selling items online. What I learned from this experience was that no matter who you are talking to or what your issue is, you need to be clam, patient, and listen to what they have to say. My co-workers were friendly, helpful, and reliable. The hardest part of my job was going through weekly classes based on the updates of our products. The most enjoyable part of my job was working in my environment. The employees there make work enjoyable."
good,"Very fast paced organization, managing through tremendous change over the course of year, as it seeks to be very successful."
good,Day to day I get to meet new interesting clients which is what I enjoy most about my current job as a Geek Squad Repair Agent. I get to meet new people on a daily basis and train them on current technology of which I excel at. Whether my clients are purchasing their first personal computer ever or are skilled technicians themselves I am there to help to guide them to hardware and software that they may not be aware of.
good,"A great company that supplies a starter job and/or career, with decent benefits and pay. Allows you to learn almost everything there is to know about electronics. This company also allows you to see what your consumers true desires are and what it's like to run a company as lucrative as Best Buy. I've learned a lot skill sets and an awesome level of professionalism and top of line customer service. Glad to say that I had the opportunity to work for this company."
good,Flexible and helpful environment. Employees there friendly and nice.

good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Wonderful place to work. Business driven with the employee and customer in mind.
good,Typical work day consisted of downloading and stocking merchandise
good,"I am currently a Consultation Agent with Geek Squad at Best Buy. A typical day involves me having appointments with clients that are having issues with their devices. My job is to diagnose the issue, troubleshoot electronics, find out who has warranty and if not I sell Geek Squad services. At times its challenging, but I love to learn new things. Every day is different and there is always something new to learn."
good,"Through my employment at Best Buy, I enjoyed comparing what I learned in my classes to what I saw at work. Though the company is experiencing issues in recent years and has needed to make many efforts toward rebranding, I was able to identify the relationships between processes coming down from corporate, implemented through the retail stores, and results through customer purchases and experiences. While I have a passion for technology and electronics in general, what really kept me interested in work at Best Buy was the people I was working with. The store had a fun, exciting atmosphere and the managers and coworkers reflected that image. Management staff was extremely flexible with me because I was a student, but they also made sure I had specific goals, understood them, and knew how to achieve them. Whether they were overall goals in my life or specific goals for my job, I was always aware of where I stood and knew that my coworkers were there to help me get to where I needed to go."
good,"Great co-workers, rough work/life balance.  I would work there again.  As long as I didn't have a big family"
good,"Has provided for myself and my family for 7 years. Good pay and employee discount, benefits aren't the best and required holiday work days are a bit of an inconvenience."
good,"A typical day at work consists of me either opening the store of coming in for a closing shift. I contact customers and sell them computers, televisions, cell phones, whatever it is the customer needs, I have the knowledge to provide them with the product that is right for them. When I don't have any customers in the entire store to help, I clean any surfaces that might aren't presentable, or I down-stock products that are missing from the shelves. I learned a lot of different things since I started at Best Buy, I learned a plethora of different facts about each and every cell phone down to their carriers, accessories, and activations. I learn something new about computers every single day. I have also learned a large amount about the stores personal inventory system and how everything works behind the scenes. The management if fairly nice most of the time unless you do something wrong (of course). Some of the managers are unprofessional and unproductive though, others are fantastic, some of the best managers I have ever had. A lot of the time, when the general manager is in the store, he makes most people either nervous or irritable because he is a very aggressive person. My co-workers also go one of two ways, they either have the work ethic of a saint or they feel the need to walk around in circles and not do anything at all. The hardest part of my job is finding full solutions for customers because most of the time, customers are too shy to tell you what they need. Sometimes, they don't know what they need so we have to ask all of the right questions in order to get them"
good,working at the busiest store in the district there was never any lack of work. It was a fun environment. We dedicated ourselves to the motto fast and accurate. Being the best while having fun.

good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Lots of things for employee to get involved in, be it in the workplace or in the community. Managers are more like friends rather than your boss."
good,"Everyday may seem the same, but once you learn the responsibilities of your position... It changes that quick. The company has to be aggressive with the current competition. It's a challenge of how your going to adapt and respond to change. Either you love it or you don't make it. There is room for promotion within the company and hands on training. However, with today's economy and the competition of electronic retailers... There is always the possibility of reorganization. In which positions are cut and new ones created to accommodate the majority of the lost positions."
good,"-Met with clients to help them purchases what better fits their needs."

I learned a lot of sales techniques to help me boost my sales. My co-workers were all very nice and always open to help me out. The hardest part of the job, was to get customers to go with the Best Buy ""Geek Squad"" insurance plan. The best part of that job was being able to sale the right product to the customer, knowing they will be happy done the road. The management were all very open and ready for questions to assure we are all getting everything done right."
good,Working for Best Buy you have to be ready to be in the fast lane.  The retail industy requires you to be ready and on demand each step of the way.
good,Best Buy is a great place to work if you just have a high school degree or partial college.
good,very good company with a detailed message and focus on its customer based
good,"While they say they may work around your schedule, there is a good chance they may not. I was lucky and worked nights since they needed bilingual people to stay at night and i volunteered for the night shift."
good,"Great student worker position. Able to connect with faculty and staff and help them find their needs in the library, as well as students."
good,"Enjoyed it every day. probably would not return as it was my second time with company, and job was eliminated"
good,"When I start work, I usually unload the truck that arrives at the store and divide the shipment into categories depending on where they will be located in the store. I also get online requests to locate product in the the store and to tag them for the customer that requested them. My job may have gotten a little tough at times but, the people I worked with made it easier to accomplish my goals. The hardest part of my job was separating the shipment because I was ""new"" to the job and I didn't know where everything went. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I did online requests because I like being able to fulfil someone's request."
good,"A typical day at work would be working out excel data file and going through hundreds of tags to update information in our system stating how long the part that we are waiting for takes and if I will need to contact the vendor regarding this unit. I also have to contact customers daily regarding their unit that they are having repaired to give them an update. I also contact the vendors that we work with regarding part information. I do computer work daily and make phone calls. I help my fellow employees when needed."
good,"Pretty fun place, learn lots about technology. However, I did not agree with judging employees based on how much  insurance they sold."

good,"My job consists of daily coaching and training of employees based on selling skills.

Throughout these last couple of years, i've gotten the opportunity to learn about technology, problem solving, and finding solutions to create better customer satisfaction. I enjoyed working with my co-workers that I have been working with along as helping customers get their desired needs"
good,"Best Buy was not a bad place to work. Reasonable benefits, you get to work with a wide variety of people, good ethics. The pressure can be a little rough some times but you just have to remember you benefit when the company benefits so that pressure is only help you to succeed and overcome your own challenges."
good,General Manager is a great mentor.  Hours are very long and it takes away from family life.

good,"fast paced sales environment, team training/character building."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Enjoyable experience with a lot of education about products and policies. Sales driven though.  There was a push to get applications for credit cards and to sign customers up for equipment protection.
good,"Electronics customers appreciate and trust Best Buy's products and services.  BB stays on top of what's new and valuable to their customer base.  Further, they try to focus on ensuring customer satisfaction, especially in service."

good,Great place for students to work part time during school and for adults seeking a career.
good,"Allowed me to advance over the years and also complete a first degree, gained experience in multiple roles"
good,"-Help Customers and clean and stock shelves"
good,"Very fun and sales motivated."
good,"Las actividades de trabajo al igual que mis compañeros de trabajo son de mi agrado sin embargo hay dos puntos que me han hecho buscar nuevas opciones, la primera es el liderazgo ya que no es bueno y la empresa esta en un punto vulnerable en el que la manera en que se vienen haciendo las cosas de medio años al presente lo convierten en un lugar no estable de trabajo, y la segunda razón es que ya no estoy interesada en un trabajo parcial estoy muy interesada en un empleo de mas responsabilidad."
good,"Stocking the store after unloading the truck was a typical day. I learned a lot about shipping, receiving, retuning, and ordering. The management team and co-workers were very good and fun to be around."
good,"Engage customers using selling skills to build complex, connected solutions in a fast-paced,"
good,"The work environment was great, people and co workers are friendly and fun to be around. Only downfall about working at best buy is if you have not been employed there for at least 3 years your hours are so minimal you could not support a family with this one job alone. Also, there are no benefits unless you are a full time employee and it takes a couple years to be a full time employee. Management is great and very understanding and they will do their best to work with you."
good,"Having been with the company for nearly 8 1/2 years, I have had the chance to meet many different people and experience many different situations. I have also been given opportunities to learn and grow within the company. I have led many teams of people, led many trainings, and learned a lot on how to deal with people in all sorts of situations. I have developed the skills of being a leader, a mentor, an expert, and someone who can listen to problems as well as solve them."
good,"Working with customers is always great, helping them find what they want, answering questions, and over all just spreading knowledge of awesome technology. I really wish I worked there currently and more often but seasonal is seasonal. I definitely got a great inside view of all the new technology out there."
good,"Working here was my first experience in the job world. I was a cashier working during Black Friday, and it was busy. It gave me the experience of working under pressure."
good,"Good company that cares for its employees."
good,"I was seasonal so I rarely got shifts longer than 4 hours but the good thing about working seasonal was that during that 4 hours I was very busy. Working in the mobile department, I learned a lot about the new and popular phones and I learned how to activate them. My co-workers were fun but I was surprised at how little professionalism there was once I had been working there for a while. Also, when they let me go, they let me go in an unprofessional way and gave me no reason as to why they didn't keep me after season and wouldn't let me try another department that I thought I was more suited for. The hardest part of the job was trying to sell insurance on the phones to people who were persistent in not wanting it, but with my manager less than a few feet from me, it looked bad if they walked away without it. The most enjoyable part was learning about the hot new technology and new electronics. I was required to do e-learnings about new products and it made me become really interested in knowing everything there was to know about the new stuff so I can answer customer questions as best as I could. I also loved when I was the reason for a customer leaving happy. I wish I got more feedback from management about my performance while working there because I would have liked the chance to better myself and better my work experience."
good,Nice part time job.  No health or benefits for part time workers.  Hard to advance within a store.  better opportunity if you are willing to relocate.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Typical day at work revolved around meeting new / return customers, providing information about products and services.

Good coverage of departments meant that every day at work was interesting with friendly coworkers that got along and had each others backs."
good,"A day in the life at best buy is very easy going. There is a lot of task giving to complete as well as goals. I work in the home sales side which includes but not limited to, home theater, appliances, digital imaging, and car electronics.

good,Working for a diverse and technology hip company was an awesome experience.
good,"I was never upset to go to work. I loved the people I worked with, everyone was happy, cheerful, and helpful. Management was fantastic and was always there when I needed them. The hardest part of the job was when I was alone and had a huge line with no help. The most enjoyable part was relating to the customers and what they were buying. It was a lot of fun and I loved the products that I was selling. It was very relate able and easy to be myself."
good,"This job when I was in High School was great! I was very good at sales and strived very hard at my position. I learned all the updated Tech and I wasn't confide to one section. It was great be a reliable source to my co-workers. I was the ""go to guy"" when we had to meet certain numbers. The hardest part of this job was nothing really because I knew almost everything. I enjoyed seeing confused customers and them letting myself give them the knowledge they so desperately sought out."
good,"Was a good job might go back, had good management liked my co-workers"
good,Its a fun hard working environment where the employees number one goal is customer serivce.
good,Assist customers; Stocking; Financial transactions. Ensured customer satisfaction.
good,I run a team that travels all across the country remodeling Best Buy stores. Its a lot hours and even more work but its been a great experience. I haven't worked in a store in a long time so I can't really speak to that anymore but most people I talk to say they still enjoy it.
good,"In my experience with Best Buy I have learned more about current technology than any class or website. The managers are your typical managers; some great and some not so great. The co-workers are some of the best part though. Not every one is perfect but for the most part the people I work with are some of the best I've had the experience to deal with. One of the most frustrating things you deal with is when a customer comes in and says that on the web site we have a certain item; although our systems don't update immediately so quite often the case is that we don't have what they are looking for. Then you have to try and explain why to an upset and confused customer. On the other end of the spectrum how every is the most enjoyable part of working at Best Buy. When a customer comes in and knows nothing about what they need, you have the opportunity to enlighten them. After half an hour of teaching them what all there is and listening to what they need, they look at you with a deep appreciation for helping them and the feeling from that is extremely rewarding."

good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Day to day operation in shipping, receiving an storage of electronic items. I learned lots about the AS400 and planning. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with other employees and hardest part of the job was the 115 mile drive everyday."
good,"Best Buy is a great company when you do not work for them. They will give you the hours you need, work with your school schedule, and even have parties and gifts for you when they have the budget. However they demand too much from their employees with no benefits and pay to back up those demands. If you do not meet a credit card goal over a certain period of time then you get written up. If you do not have ""complete"" sales your hours are cut. I do understand this is a business and you have to hold people accountable but they ways this company feels that they need to do this does not work."
good,"Very nice place to work. Compensation for certifications, or excellent service."
good,"decent place to work, be nice if they cared more about the employees then the money coming in"
good,"I enjoyed working for Best Buy during their seasonal holiday.  I was a loss prevention specialist, which meant that I got a lot of one-on-one customer time.  It was wonderful.  I got to walk around and help people, I answered questions, watched the cameras.  It was a great customer environment where I could get hands on, face to face interaction.  I liked it."
good,"greeting customers, assisting them get any thing they needed from the store. learned about the products. management was pretty good to deal with and the hardest part of the job is not having a lot of family time during the holidays."
good,The location has closed but the company itself is a great place to work. you will always learn a new job.
good,A typical day found me at my desk working through hundreds of plan updates.  I was there on contract and really focused on producing as much work as I could.  My co-workers were helpful and friendly and the management was supportive.
good,"When I first started Best Buy, I was working as a Customer Service Agent for Geek Squad. I absolutely loved it. The job was challenging and difficult at times, but I was constantly doing something different. Eventually I was promoted to full-time and when that happened, everything changed. My position was switched from Geek Squad Services to the Best Best retail side of things. I was soon training every associate that needed point of sale training and watched as they were promoted from under me. Then they decided to open up on Thanksgiving."

good,A typical day at work involved thinking of new ways to prevent theft from occurring. I learned how to inventory and keep good records of things occurring during business hours such as sales and theft. Management was very good at listening to new ideas that could help improve business. Co-workers always communicated with other employees to make sure everyone was on the same page. The hardest part of the job was making sure customers were happy with their service and they got the answers they were looking for. The most enjoyable part of the job was stopping immediate dangers from happening to innocent people in the store.
good,"great place to work mostly good people, not much room for advancement, five years in same position even after multiple interviews and awesome reviews it all about who you are friends with."
good,"A typical day at work consists of troubleshooting client problems and offering at counter solutions if possible. I've learned to spot common problems people have everyday with their devices. Great place to work, especially because management is amazing and so are my coworkers. "
good,"Best Buy has a culture of fun and working with good people. There are exceptions such as management. In my experience, the seasoned managers are better to work with then the newer, inexperience, lacking education managers."
good,Best Buy was an energetic and fun place to work.  Job security is an issue with this company...
good,"Great discount and co-workers. Easy job, not demanding. Managers do not follow policy, they just give away prouduct which is not good for the company"
good,"I am big on video games, and thus was in the video game department,  also my general knowledge of electronics allowed me to help customers in many areas."
good,"Great company to work for, Scheduling is not great. Pay could be better"
good,Best Buy was a fun place to work with the latest and greatest products out there. The pay is weak and the Work life Balance is tough to work every weekend.
good,always good people everyone strives to get along and help one another with anything you need help with granted you have bad days but that happens
good,"Most of my responsibilities involve dealing with customers. Making sure they are adequately taken care of and their questions are answered.

My day consisted of analyzing daily and weekly reports to determine where the business was succeeding and needing increased focus, training the members of my team, and working with fellow managers to ensure the business succeeds and the team is running smoothly. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job were the constant changes that the industry as well as Best Buy made. Each day brought something new to learn and teach which made the job both fun and challenging. I also greatly enjoyed being apart of my team, watching them grow, and interacting with the customers and taking part in the sales process."

good,"I truly enjoy working at Best Buy. The store has a fun atmosphere that makes working there easy. Offering services on computers can be tough. Computers are extremely personal items, and when they break down it can be very stressful. Clients often come in and are frustrated or confused. I take pride in helping these clients, in making them feel like they are being taken care of. This would be the hardest part of my job, but knowing that they are relieved is the best part."
good,"Working at Best Buy is very rewarding because of the mission of the company to provide connectivity no matter where you are or what you are doing.

good,great discount and they provide great trainnning. team members are social and managers are friendly.
good,"Working at Best Buy is very rewarding because of the mission of the company to provide connectivity no matter where you are or what you are doing. Best Buy will show and provide their customers with all the ways that families, friends, co-workers, companies, churches and so many more can keep in touch, handle business across the waters, send pictures from phone to tv, from country to country, even input the ingredients of their home refrigerator into the refrigerator application via Wi-Fi and produce a five star meal for dinner. I have learned how to make some moments in our customers life much more pleasurable and easier with less hassle or time consuming doing everyday chores so that they can enjoy the more valuable moments in life."
good,"70%:"
good,"Working at Best Buy was an enjoyable place to work, because you got a chance to interact with many different types of customers each day, and all with individual needs. A typical day at work was, meet, and greet the customers, ask them lifestyle questions, and finding the right products and solutions to meet their needs.  Role playing, coaching, and training the staff around customer interactions. The hardest part of the job, was not being able to completely resolve every issue that arose in the store with our customers and their concerns."

good,"""Having fun while being the best!"" is our motto. We seem to stick to it very well; we enjoy our job and do it well. I have learned that you are only as strong as your weakest link. Fortunately, we have a strong team that always encourage each other to continue to strive for excellence. I work in a team of approximately 13 people who have worked together around 5 years with each other. Since we have worked together for so long, we have become a tightly knit group who knows each others work habits and abilities. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I make a difference in my daily role. The satisfaction from making a customer happy by getting resolutions for them is a complete joy. Unfortunately, there is always a hard part of every job, and I'd have to say the hardest part of my job is when I get the call from a customer who has been bounced around and not given a straight answer so they are completely frustrated. However, that is where my people skills come into play and I do my best to give them resolutions where I can make them a happy customer once again. "
good,"Great place to work, very social environment. They actually educate employees there in order to better serve customers."

Once hired in there are no advancement opportunities unless you relocate, will not promote from within.  Flexible and generally care about employees well being."

The best part was the fun and extended family I obtained.

good,"The work days were pretty busy, I learned how to function with a lot of different personalities. I had a good relationship with my dependable managers, The hardest part of the job was lifting the product. Mist enjoyable was meeting new people."

Open building doors, run the floor, greet customers and watch cameras. Research missing products and time theft. I learned how to be a team leader and communicate with employees and customers. The hardest part of my job would be getting told opposite of what is supposed to be done. The enjoyable part of the job is great management and getting to help people with their needs around the store. "

good,Best Buy worked out for a little while but its definitely not a place I would want to build a career.  
good,"I really enjoyed working at Best Buy mainly because we were responsible for the customer promise which is:The latest devices and services all in one place, Knowledgeable, impartial advice, Competitive prices, Shop when and where you want, To support you for the life of your product. These things helped me to grow and build relationships and learn about myself in many different ways. You have to work hard to meet goals and make an effort. The hardest part of the job was dealing with tough customers that belittle you or there were some prejudice however I had a great team of support behind me that helped build confidence. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around people all the time."
good,"There was always work to do no matter the time or day. I Learned how to repair TV's and electronics by hands on training with the Tech support team themselves. My Co-Workers were amazing and were always there to help me with anything. The Hardest Part of my job must have been lifting the heavy Plasma TV's onto the working desk without breaking them, but i enjoyed fixing them "
good,"Decent pay and benefits, great co-workers, very enjoyable"
good,"For three years I was primarilly a phone laison between customers who had brought their 'ailing' computers to the Geek Squad for repair, and the actual technicians working with the product. In many instances, I was conversing with repair facilities other than those where I was located in-store. This meant I was one of a triad of people involved: the customer, the technician in-store who accepted the product initially, and the remote facility to which Best Buy had shipped the product for final analysis and repair. "
good,"fun place to work, productive, very busy, learn something new everyday"
good,"I have been working for Best Buy while I went to college and I can say that Best Buy made balancing work and school very easy. I work in the Geek Squad so a typical day for me is different than a blue shirt. Typical day would be coming into work and running reports, shipping, receiving client and store stock units, filing, answering phones, basically the administrative role. Overall it is not a very difficult job but multitasking is a must because there is always something that needs to be done."
good,"I loved working for Best Buy. I was in the media department and was always up to date on the latest games and music. This was very fun and selling to customers was easy if you knew what to ask them about. Very nice work atmosphere, schedule was usually very flexible as well. "
good,It wasn't too bad working there. For the most part I enjoyed it. If it was slow it got kinda boring because there's only so much cleaning you can do at one register. I would work there again if I got the chance.
good,"I get the customer service desk ready before customers come and get registers ready. Perform returns and exchanges. Check customers in for any problems with their computer, tablet, phones etc. Troubleshoot any computer issues that customers have. Sell tech support, geek squad protection and card protection."
good,didnt had much chance to learn..the place was shut down a month later i started working..
good,Good starting job for someone trying to get a basic understanding of PC's. Hired on position / rate is hard to advance out of despite time on job / skill level.
good,"its a good place to work, with many changes.  Politics can occur at certain locations but as long as you keep to yourself youll be fine.  The co workers can be great but also back stabbing.  Enjoyed working with technology."
good,I loved the people that i worked with. Was a great atmosphere. I left because our store was scheduled to close. The company did not give us a lot of help in finding other work so i went out on my own and found another job. The day after i had quit they found out the store was staying open.
good,As a cash supervisor expect to work hard to meet quota deadlines while managing the front department of the store.
good,"Best Buy is a retail environment, with a commission based sales feeling.  Very numbers based.  Not a great place if you would like to have a family.  Managers are required to work 50 plus hours and very long shifts during the holidays."

good,"Worked at Best Buy/Mobile for 8 years it was a fun environment for the most part due to the people I worked with over the years. Now with that being said the environment at my particular store could change in the blink of an eye. One minute you're down stocking, cleaning up, helping a few customers here and there, then the next you are swamped with customers!!! So the environment was a roller-coaster at times. I worked with some really great people and that is one thing I miss the most, management was sketchy some of my managers were great managers and people as a whole. Then you had the ones who were only about themselves and never really helped employees to better themselves and move up. Also many things were very political you had to scratch the right backs to move up, I saw people for years wait and wait and wait to become a manager or supervisor after hearing words for the higher ups that their time was coming. If you're looking for a career with this company I won't turn away and say negative things about the company as a whole because they are a good company, but if you are looking for a career I recommend you do your job go to work go home, fraternize a little but not to much, if you are given a task just do it and hopefully you get into a store where the management is about lifting up the employee's who are striving to move up the ladder because there are stores that have great managers."
good,"Manager employees to make sure they are landed their behaviors with customers."
good,Depending on which store you are employed at the employment experience at Best Buy can vary. Usually the environment is encouraging and there are opportunities to move into management. 
good,It was a great starter job! I had a lot of fun learning how to cashier and how to interact with customers. There was a high turnover rate however that was unattractive about the job.
good,"Everyday I worked with my team to try meet the highest customer satisfaction. We would ask many questions to customers to fully understand everything the would need even if they didn't know that product existed. I was sent to a sales training seminar so I could fully learn customer service better. Management was decent, they tried to get with you as much as possible so they could tell you how you were doing and to try to teach you other techniques. Co-workers were great to have because you could bounce ideas off one another and make up games to boost your confidence and have fun at your job. The hardest part for most people was getting customers to sign up for credit cards. The most enjoyable part was the team experience."
good,"I learned how to manage cellular customer accounts, set up accounts, and troubleshoot cell phone problems. My co-workers were upbeat and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was setting up accounts manually when the computer system went down. I enjoyed the hands on experience as well as the customer interactions I had on a daily basis. "
good,fast loud busy fun environment. meet a lot of good people good for college students
good,"Help the manager hand out and count the registers before the day begins and be the opening cashier or customer service representative, whichever they told me to do. Attach protection plans to big ticket items. And help manage other cashiers and make sure they're attaching at the proper rate."
good,Best Buy is a great place to work. The environment is layed back and the employees are like family.
good,As a Supervisor a vast majority of my job is coaching and training my direct employees while executing the sales strategies provided and expected by the company. Also responsible for developing people and getting them ready for promotion if that is their desired career aspirations. Most enjoyable part of the job is when someone you have developed succeeds and earns a promotion and also seeing a customer thrilled with the experience and service we provided to them.
good,"Worked for best buy for 10 years. Old saying goes you dont leave companys, you leave managers. Make sure you have a support staff thats willing to have your back. Power management vs servant leaders."
good,"high energy customer service, great coworkers, awesome benefits and employee discount"
good,"In the last year, Best Buy's customer service roles have changed quite a bit. First, Best Buy merged Geek Squad with customer service. They didn't just merge our counters, they merged our departments. At this point, myself and the other customer service representatives were responsible for sending out and receiving client's computers, being able to answer basic technical questions, and offering Geek Squad services. The Geek Squad agents helped with customer service if they knew the proper process. About a month ago, all computer services were back to being fulfilled through the Geek Squad agents. Now the customer service agents are responsible for servicing cell phones and processing hardware swaps for clients to retain their data during the service period. Although all of the changes have had their difficult moments of adjustment, I have been able to gain a lot of knowledge regarding computers and cell phones which has been helpful in enhancing my sales skills in regards to our offered services. The management has been incredible through all of the ups and downs in the changes as well. They make it very easy to talk to them which has been helpful when learning the new processes and having concerns with the changes. Being comfortable with the management has been a huge positive with this job. The same goes for my co-workers. Regardless of when I leave the job, I know that I will be leaving with an amazing new group of friends. Despite being great friends, when we are in the work place, it is business. Every customer is greeted quickly and helped efficiently and to their satisfaction."
good,Involved research and analysis utilizing LexisNexis and Westlaw. Learned how to organize and assemble legal transcripts. This was a very enjoyable learning experience.
good,"At Best Buy, i would get to work, and clock in, then proceed to my designated ""area of interest"" or ""station"" and keep the stock inventory up, the area clean, and customers satisfied and informed on an inquires they may acquire. I learned a lot about electronics and how they worked, i learned how to take stock inventory and look up stock on the computers. Management was wonderful and very understanding, they were helpful and caring. My co-workers were unbelievably cooperative, and patient, they were kind and treated all with respect. The hardest part of the job, was remembering where everything went, but after a few days I found that to not be such an issue. The best part of the job was helping and working with people and also learning how to be a better sales person."
good,"I enjoyed working at Best Buy very much while I was working on my mechanical engineering degree. I got the chance to work with a lot of great people and had a good time getting to know customers as well. I learned a lot about building personal relationships with coworkers and customers as well as how to work well with a team. I learned a lot from management, as it was a goal of mine to grow and become a leader among my peers. It was hard to leave, but it was necessary for me to leave to devote time to finish my degree and ultimately start my new career."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Overall as a company it is a great place to work when you have the proper management, but there really is no room for growth within the company they post listings for full time spots not to advance a part timer, but to have another full timer switch positions to fit their needs. I love being able to help people discover new things that they can do with their devices, I think the hardest part of working there is keeping up with all the new advances in well, everything. i've also learned while working there you can't judge people i've had countless customers ask me something then ask another employee typically a man, the same question and get the same answer or they look to me for the answer, even elderly people can keep up with the growing advances if they so choose which is great I love to be surprised by people."
good,"I only worked there for Christmas seasonal. Found it uncomfortable. Was not there long enough. I liked how I could work alone for periods of time, but also had the team atmosphere as well."

good,"My typical day of work consist of processing fast and accurate retuns and exchanges, check in and out customers computers, balance registers, coach and train asscoiates. In my years of employment with this company I have learned alot of patience, how to handle difficult situations without getting management involved. Im great a multi tasking from working with this company. Managment could be better with taking care of our customers and associates. My coworkers are easy to get alone with we work well together. The hardest part of my job is trying to take care of every customer that I encounter. I love make people happy and I try to do that with every customer I come into interaction with. Sometime that's the hard part of my job not being able to find a solution that will benefit the customer. The most enjoyable portion of my job is being able to interact with different people everday. I learn new things from my customers everyday."
good,Get to stay up to date with the latest technology while having fun providing complete digital solutions to clients.
good,This has been a great job with a flexible schedule to have while in school.
good,My management would always work with me to balance my work and school schedule and I believe I got great experience in providing excellent customer service and retail sales.
good,"My 3 years with best buy were very good during that time. The employees and management are very helpful and take your opinions seriously. The hardest part for working for Best Buy is meeting weekly sales quota. If your performance is not at a certain level in a certain amount of time, then you will be on probation."
good,"It was my first job and it laid down the ground work for my work ethic today. I enjoyed going to work everyday. I loved the people i worked with. It was a fun job that required good customer service and sales skills. Management was always solid, and hours were easy to come by."

Also help at customer service with returns/ exchanges. shrink warping open items. I was able to learn a lot from working for Best Buy such as being able to communicate with customers more clearly to help the find exactly what they are looking for, keep track of numbers in order to hit goal for the day. For the most part the management was good we didnt have as many managers that we need and was short a GM. The hardest part of the job would have to be always doing multiple things at one time for hours. I loved working for the company it was very fast paced fun environment."
good,I literally worked every department in this store and learned everything about electronics plus how to process payroll and how to conduct proper customer service
good,Best Buy is a fun place to work but expects too much from their employees and offers little in return

While at best buy, I learn more about computers and the many items one would need to have there computer run currectly. The management are young and very helpfully with helping employees perform at the best of there ablities. My coworkers where always fun to work with anyday of the week.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the discounts for employees."

good,"Fantastic environment to be employed and enjoy the job that you have, Learned management skills as well as communication skills."
good,"Best Buy was a great place to work for and it was hard to ever get bored working there. There was always something new coming into the building every week and we rarely had any down time. I enjoyed being some of the first people to get the final product and test out things before before i bought or sold it. Management was also great but it depends on who you talk to. Each store has about four managers, and one general manager. Therefore you would often see personality clashes because of the different managing techniques. Overall it was a great place to work if you are looking for a retail type of job that deals with technology."
good,I received very good sales training while working at Best Buy that allowed me to move to a job with very good sales compensation.

good,"Best buy was my first actual job, what I mean is its the first job that I can have on a resume, not on at a flee market or something, and it was a good one for what I intended it to be, an entry level job. My co-workers were great and we had some fun at work, but that's pretty much where is stops for perks. In the time I have been there almost all management has been replaced which doesn't mean too much other than it didn't seem like any job security at that level. On so many occasions a job would open up and some of my friends who were very well qualified applied and almost always someone from another store would be hired. Thankfully the managers who I did work with were good and didn't make work to much like...work. But unless you just love retail this was the extent of what I planned for best buy."

good,"This was one of my favorite jobs in the St Cloud area. The managers were mostly great besides a few scheduling conflicts, but they listened and cared that you were enjoying work and doing well. My co-workers were my favorite part of working there, and I really enjoyed when I could use my knowledge to help a customer make a smart purchase. Far too much standing in one place and too short of breaks for my tastes though."
good,Excellent management team. Loyal and friendly customer base.
good,Typical day at work was greet customers and provided information about specific mobile devices they desired to buy.
good,Coaching and training employees in sales excellence. Enjoyed the team I was in charge of. Hardest part was commute and management breaking policy and vendor contracts at this location.
good,"I loved working at Bestbuy, but the management there had their favorites which affected the employees. Getting up everyday to go to work was a breeze since you never knew what to expect from either the customers or co-workers. There really wasnt a hard part in the job, you just had to keep up with your job duties and everything else was smooth going. Overall there was never a dull moment there."
good,"A normal day at work consisted of helping customers and getting to know their needs and provide the appropriate solution. I learned a lot about different technology, as well as how to communicate on a different level with customers. All of my co-workers were helpful and fairly easy to work with. Management is alright. Some improvements could be made, because it often seems like not everyone is on the same page, which makes in frustrating when certain people aren't doing their duities. Overall it's a pleasant place to work."

good,"I worked in the parts inventory area. In the beginning I was in order management. I would collect a list of parts from the correct areas, process them, then deliver them to our technicians with high quality customer service. This was fast paced and all orders needed to be on the floor quickly and correctly. I would restock shelves and take part of inventory counts regularly. Later I was recognized for my great attention to detail and accuracy. From this I was moved to a team that was focused on quality control of the parts, dealing with vendors, and recovering lost items within the warehouse. Most enjoyable part was working as a team to accomplish great service numbers and records."
good,"Working at the Best buy warehouse was very fun, friendly co-workers, work started off loading merchandise scanning then loading the struck requires a lot of energy and hard wok the hardest part was not knowing how many hours yo were working each day the most enjoyable part was the co-workers friendly and inviting personality's!"
good,"I usually enjoyed going to work every day at Best Buy. Its like any other company, some days were good and some were bad. With the recent financial strain on the company though, more days were bad than good."
good,The overall experience depends on who you are working with on a particular day. They do not put the right people in the right jobs and they often hire those that do not have strong work ethics. They don't typically understand the link between happy employees and satisfactory customer service.
good,"A typical day at work would start with me either opening my department or closing at the end of the day, I learned how to contact customers and how to carry a conversation with them along with many icebreakers to make them feel comfortable shopping with me. Management was friendly and easy to talk to incase there were any problems as well were my co-workers. They were easy to get along with and carry out our daily goals. The hardest part of the job was closing the store since customers would come and knock things over, or throw their garbage around and we would have to clean up after them. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to make the customers smile and making their shopping experience enjoyable"
good,"Best buy allowed me to be very helpful to customers who may have preferred a smooth shopping experience. As well as prepare to make any last accommodations for a customer before they leave the store because a large store like Best Buy can cause you to come in and buy everything except the one thing you came for, and that's what my job was, to make sure they had an unforgettable shopping experience."
good,This Was A Great Job For Young People That Love To Interact With New Technologies.
good,A typical day at work is waking up at 5 which i loved going in when its only the merchandising crew. make sure all product is out on the floor and priced in the right area. I learned so much working with this company thanks to my supervisors who took his time and showed me the right way to do everything. My manager was awesome and caring.My co workers were friendly and always willing to help. The hardest part of the job was store transitions but it was a fun experience.
good,"Best Buy is a fortune 500 company that includes over a thousand retail locations. This allows the retailer to centralize much of the structural and functional processes throughout the company, thus producing a standardized working environment. Employees are offered competitive pay and flexible work schedules. Training is continuous and effective. The supervisors at Best Buy are very connected to their employees and are understanding of issues and conflicts that may arise from time to time."
good,"Researching and learning about the products in the store, especially in your department because Best Buy doesn't train. The majority of the time is spent conversing with customers about the technology and explaining the differences between them."
good,A typical Best Buy day is repetitive from a customer service and loss prevention's perspective. You learn how to deal with every type of customer because Best buy is always busy. You also learn patterns and habits of every type of customer. Your co-workers can vary because Best Buy employs teenagers. Not to say teens are bad but communication is not always there between generations. Luckily for Best Buy they also employs some of the best managers to direct everyone to the same goal. My toughest part of being a Best Buy employee was monitoring the entire store and lowering the shrink percentage. Coincidentally my most enjoying experience was my series of promotions based on performance.
good,Good company to work for and I often do recomend someone to apply.
good,"I am able to use my talents to exceed all goals, while continuing my personal growth."
good,I have learned a great deal in my tenure at Best Buy. I have had the opportunity to be a part of many employee's development through structured trainings led by me.
good,"My typical day at work includes checking out customers after they picked out there product. I also work at the customer service desk doing basic returns, pick up orders, answer the phones, and dealing with customer issue's."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Fun, fast-paced place to work. Great people. Lots of product knowledge acquired."
good,I love working for Best Buy. As far as finances go the compensation could be a lot better but overall the environment makes it worth-while as a temporary job. Retail is always going to be a speed bump when dealing with difficult people but having a community that is comfortable making the job fun helps tremendously.
good,"This is a good job for when you're a kid, you'll have fun with your co-workers, other then that the job gets pretty bland."
good,"helping customers, merchandising are most of the duties, very laid back job, but its retail"
good,A typical day at work consists of coaching and training my direct reports along with filtering client concerns and resolving client issues. Driving the business metrics is a huge piece of my day.
good,• Processed online customer orders
good,"Has helped me learn to genuinely connect with your customers. In doing so the company is happy because you are able to reach sales goals, and the customer is happy because you were able to actually fulfill their needs.Unfortunately as it is a large retail chain it gets its fair share of unfavorable feedback but overall there was a pleasant atmosphere."
good,Great fun and familiar. Love the people great benefits and structured very well.
good,learn how to work with customers in a fast developing environment. allowing you growth within the company to learn more about the business
good,"Learn many skills, Selling skills, How to working with customers, as well as the very basics of running your own business"
good,I worked for Best Buy and although I loved the customer interaction and the employees it was a bit tough balancing between the long hours and family
good,Learned alot about retail that has improved my experience working with customers in a busy environment.
good,enjoyed working with different customers eveyday coworkers were pleasant
good,Great people but lack of leadership. Loved the culture. I enjoyed coaching employees and learned a lot about business.
good,"At Best Buy we always had fun. Joke around with co workers, yet it wasn't as laid back as you would think it was. Great company to work for."
good,"Retail Sales of Electronics, Appliances, computer networking and repair services. A very enjoyable place to work with great people and a fun and friendly atmosphere."
good,"Best Buy is an enjoyable place to work, due in no small part to the camaraderie and collaborative spirit amongst its employees."
good,Most of the people I work with at Best Buy truly want to move the business forward and see the company succeed. It is great to be in an environment where everyone is trying to push in the same direction.
good,"I have spent alot of years with Best buy and they have all been good. Never met a better group of co-workers, but as the landscape changes so do our needs."
good,"I really like Best Buy overall. My job an the people ive worked with. The discount wwas excellent. I think that was one o the primary reasons i stayed. The management was ok, has its ups and downs as any other place. Good luck if trying to get hired full time if you're not a favorite"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"tough business , hastle envornment."
good,"Best Buy has been good to me since I started back in 2005. I've been promoted several times and have been a Lead Functionality Technician for a while now. The training I've received has kept me on point for what I need to do in terms of IT cabling and the like. I've made some good friends with other employees and management, but I feel where I am it's not what you know, but who you know for advancement."
good,"well organized company, great employees, and good food. Someone is always willing to help, and there is always something for you to do while on break, such as getting on the computer or playing ping pong. Also, it was always a very clean work place."
good,I worked for Best Buy for over 5 years. It is a great company and a great place to start a retail career with.
good,This workplace is a great learning experience and flexible work schedule
good,"I really enjoyed working here! The people were all really great and it was just an all around fun place to be! The managers were all really helpful and friendly, you could talk to them about any problem you where having and they would help you any way they could."
good,"A fun atmosphere to work in. Having knowledge of the things your are selling should be a requirement but is not. Having knowledge will make your job much more simple. Management can be overbearing a little as they tell you to get to work a lot even when you are in the middle of doing work, that kind of thing. Nice discounts on products as well."
good,Over all not a bad place to work. Unless you are a manager it is not a long term career.
good,"I have been selling all types of products to customers, and they have been changing the idea of sales. We have less items that are asked for, by customers."
good,This is a great company to work for. It has a very fun atmosphere and the managers are always willing to help you improve your knowledge and skills to advance in the company!
good,It was like a home away from home. I really liked how well the mangement treated employees. Very much like a second family.
good,"A very fun environment to work in, great co-workers and sales reps. Great customer service and I have become very knowledgeable of electronics while working there."
good,"This is one of the better jobs I’ve had. Managers were always willing to work with me, the work was always interesting, and I felt supported by coworkers. There were stressful days but I felt equipped to handle them most of the time. Id love to go back."
good,"A great place to learn about new technology that is being released. Pay is okay and have great flexible hours, the downside is the cut of hours to part timers without warning after off season. Makes it hard to make enough for the bills."
good,"The benefits at best buy are extensive. They do take care of their employees in that sense. The pay is not great. It starts above minimum wage, but not by much. It's a retail job. The days and nights are long. Customers can be stressful."
good,Its a okay place to work .Was a lot of drama and alot of messiness between the managment. I would recommend if you are fresh out of highschool. Can be alittle Underwhelming.
good,"I had a great time working at best buy, and I learned a lot of skills that I still use today even though I am not employed in any field around what I was doing there. Lots of team building through group workloads that makes the job easier. Helped me learn how to get my point across to someone without stepping on their toes."
good,"While I was working at Best Buy, the people around me really made my working environment fun and great especially the people in my department. The work in the Customer Service sector of Best Buy was a good introduction to the working environment, not too hard but also not super easy."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I loved working with the general public on technical problem solving.  Finding the right solutions was normally a great time.  I really learned how to LISTEN to the customer to find the perfect solution for of their needs.   A lot of my high school friends worked there too so the culture was always great.  The hardest part of the job, as always communication between human.  Good thing that is my specialty, which of course means it is the most enjoyable part of my day."
good,Best Buy was an ok place to work. The culture of the workplace was pretty decent a lot of interesting people. Most of the management was sub par but there were a few that wanted you to excel and go beyond.
good,"Always stayed busy doing something, hours were flexible depending on the position that you were in. Some days went by fast and were fun depending on what you were doing"
good,"Retail, but with more training and growth opportunities than usual.  Important to think through your career track before you advance - as it's hard to shift from Sales Lead to Geek Squad without taking a cut in pay."
good,"When you’re just starting to build an employment history then it is a great place to start.  Otherwise, I would not recommend seeking long term employment."
good,The pay is ok but the other employees are competitive to the point of sabotaging one another. Many of them are ignorant and curse like off shore sailors. Management is helpful and kind but have no clue about what's going on. Work isn't hard and most people are easy going. The HR department is extremely competent and professional.
good,Most employees expected me to do their jobs for them but it was still a task I could handle. Most of the time I would come in and do my work and it would usually be a normal day.
good,"If they just would have given me full time !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"Average work conditions, but company does offer excellent benefits. PTO health insurance and 401K for fulltime employees, plus discounts and other perks."
good,"Working there was fun. Had opportunity to learn more about retails. Sad part if you join during season , they will throw you in the pit without any training, i don't blame em. But in the end they will tell you that numbers are not great etc etc. I mean without any training ,people are trying their best and still. Anyhoo they will interview first saying that its permanent  but in the end they will say you were seasonal ,  so make sure."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at BestBuy, though management was very weak at times my co-workers made up for the fun I did have. If you are young and want an early start at retail this is the place for you."
good,I loved my time at Best Buy. It's demanding inasmuch as you're constantly on call (you're expected to be available when the store is open) there are razor thin margins and the CE market is intensely competitive.
good,"Overall it is a good company to work at to improve your customer service skills, and improve in sales, and inventory management. Good place for your first job."
good,"I greatly enjoyed working for Best Buy.  They had many great veteran and up and coming leader.  They valued out of the box thinking as well as process development/improvement initiatives.  The only drawback was work life balance, but that goes for many distribution careers."
good,"Best buy is a great company. They offer a lot to their employees and have good benefits. Most benefits are for those that happen to be in a full-time position. Management and workplace culture is going to vary greatly depending on locations. Valpo location, management is a bit overwhelming at times. Coworkers are pretty fun to work with and very diverse and different people. The job itself just involves a lot, especially sales positions ."
good,Too much stress for the pay. Should love working with irrational clients. Clients in aventura area like to bargain too much or request irrational compensation.
good,They have great pay they need better flexibility especially around the holidays managers never around training should be forced more. Need now hours for part time workers.
good,It pays decently well for retail which is nice.  Some of the people that work there are awesome but most of the leadership is not.  Not a whole lot of accountability and a lot of slacking.
good,"Best buy is still one of the best jobs I had in terms of accommodation from management with scheduling and duties, a very team based work environment."
good,I feel that Best Buy was a good growing experience for me. You can learn a lot as long as you are willing to be open to stepping forward when there is an opportunity.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I enjoyed working at Best Buy but always felt anxious working there. They would tell me what I should do, but I felt like they always wanted more. It was confusing. The people there were very nice and welcoming though!"
good,"job, but you can meet a lot of good hard working employees that can make the job fun and enjoyable. I learned how to do low profile security for the store. I also learned how to better manage my time as an employee. Management can be a bit demanding at times but they are all great people who are passionate about the best buy brand"
good,I had an amazing time working project team. Travel and gaining skills. I learned how to do a lot when it comes to displays and travel. It was a wonderful experience. I do not regret it.
good,"My temporary stay with this company was due to Sales just not being for me and getting a better opportunity, as there are not many there to get into without fierce favoritism and ""competition""."
good,"For a starting job it wasn't too bad. There is a lot of room to grow in management in this company. The only problem is if you don't work sales floor, no manager cares about you. The pay rates aren't that competitive. Even if you are the best in your position you won't get compensated well. You'll still get paid the same as the worst guy."
good,Great environment. On site training and advancement opportunities. Great for building experience with customer service and having fun with new tech. Great company that's willing to work with employees going to school or looking for a career
good,I had a great experience at Best Buy Mobile. My GM understood how to place people in the correct roles. Trusted and valued her employees and was very professional who still knew how stressful the job was so she allowed us to have fun.
good,"Best buy had a very good initial feel. My co-workers were friendly and helpful in getting me up to speed. However, the majority of the management team could use some improvements. Inventory truck nights were one of the hardest parts of my time working there and least enjoyable. My favorite time was in geek squad working to fix computer issues."
good,"This job was an excellent job right out of high school, they develop key attributes that correlate into other various job settings. They help develop interpersonal skills with colleagues and the general public."
good,Great opportunities for career advancement within the company. Job can be both physically demanding as you have to stand for long periods per shift while also trying to achieve work life balance. If you enjoy tech products you will enjoy this job as you are surrounded by the latest and greatest tech
good,it is a very good place to work if your are hired full time people there are very nice to work with I was only there as a temp worker that's the only thing bad about working at best buy is only 2 or 3 of the temps get hired there
good,I am confident in breaking down trucks for shipment and being able to scan such product into the system and disperse appropriately. Becoming a Inventory Specialist taught me a lot and now I am confident enough to work in any warehouse environment.
good,The job is good if you're looking just for a part time job on the side and also the discount are good if you're looking into small stuff to buy once in awhile.
good,You A lot of hours during there peak season but you are shown he labors of your hard work in the end. There is a friendly enviorment. You will have put I hard work and long ours.
good,"Fun place to work, flexible hours, mangers were not really encouraging though, they make us harass the customers at times. The policies for returns didn’t help."
good,the work at best buy wasn't hard. You are always moving though. The job was fine I didn't find it a problem. The management was really cool and tried to help out their works a lot. Work here if you want
good,to be honest it's one of the best places left due to issues with the manager of my department and pay...none the less its a great place to work for full and part time depending on your life style.
good,"Contact as much customers as possible"
good,This job was good for me as it taught me about the asset protection side of working for a company. I was able to learn how to read people and their actions.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"DO NOT GET A SEASONAL JOB AT BEST BUY"
good,I had a fun time at Best Buy and probably could have stayed there a few more years but decided to move on to other things and grow my mind but overall is a good company to work for and if they had given a more standard schedule rather than all over place I wouldn't have much to complain about.
good,"I did not work in a customer facing position, so there was little to no advancement in that role. Experience in the field was not a requisite for the manager position, but managerial experience was."
good,"Since our bonus structure has restructured, I believe that that amount of money I make per year, $38,000, compared to how long I have been with the company, 4 years, and how much I work, 40+ hours a week, is not enough to live comfortably in St Petersburg. Also my local store does not have as good of management as my previous store."
good,"I talk to customers about the products that we carry and find them the best solution for what they are looking for. The management is okay, there are a lot of redundancies which become very annoying and lower moral."
good,Good place for college kids to work. The managers really make all the difference. Show up on time and work hard and you can succeed at Best Buy. Very difficult to become a manager though.
good,"The company overall could do a lot more to make the employees feel appreciated. Many of the managers get so caught up in their jobs that they forget to continue to take care of the employees working under them. They need to go back to living by ""Having fun while being the best!"". That's when the company cared and made us want to come to work."
good,"Overall a good place to work.  "
good,"While working here I feel like I gained a lot of experience for future customer service jobs. The managers were amazing, lots of unnecessary drama within coworkers. Not much room to grow/ move up but gives you experience for your next job."
good,"During my time at BBY I enjoyed it.  However, co-workers were definitely out for themselves, supervisors definitely played favorites.  But, I made the best of it......."
good,"Great place to work if you don’t mind working weekends and the taxing holiday season. Has flexible hours, but must request off in advance. New bonus structure sucks"
good,"Best Buy culture is good, that is the best part of working there. Fellow employees and leadership are generally understanding and inclusive.  Hardest part of working for the company is when the store isn't hitting numbers, and leadership starts to pressure employees to push sales, services, and credit cards. Even if the foot traffic is light you are expected to meet and exceed said goals.  The tenured employees tend to choose other tenured employees for job advancement.  If you plan on moving up within the company plan on being prepared to move around to different stores for advancement.`"
good,"Benefits where great but like any company it can fall under bad management from store to store.  Toward the end of my tenure, there was a high turnover."
good,More information upon request.  I didn't fit the model for career advancement to General Manager.  Left for better opportunity.  Progressive sales enviorment.
good,"The job wasn't bad, but, as usual in retail, you're forced to push extra warranties, credit cards, or not-needed extras. The discount was probably the best part of the job..."
good,"Working at Best Buy isn't much different from any other retail job; you just get to be around the Latest and Greatest technology. Perks/contests through different companies where you can potentially ""win big"" without doing much more than an e-learning through their website to learn about their products/services. Management did lack a bit in the store(s) I worked in"
good,"I was just out of high school and it was a decent job at the time. I got better at customer service there while still being a teen and meet great people there,which I learned how to be a great team player ."
good,"I have worked at stores with a great GM who will allow the job to be fun and laid-back as long as it stays productive, and have also dealt with managers who are so strict nothing will get completed and is miserable to work with. Best thing to do is ask sales employees about the manager and go to close stores to see if other locations know how good or bad it is. Going into certain stores you can feel the mood difference and if you don't get an initial good feeling you may want to check somewhere else."
good,"As long as you can prove what you’re doing, you can freely work in any desired department  it’s sales so occasional bumps with customers and management expected. Managers can be hit or miss with how much or little they breathe down your back about securing credit cards more than actual sales, some managers are great leaders"
good,"favoritism is an issue here a lot of the times & thats super annoying. pay is fair, dress code isn’t horrible, nicest management i’ve ever had. it’s hard to move up but its possible."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Some employees and supervisors are very close and when there's a mistake that is made on your behalf they just make funny you behind your back. Talk a lot of smack and tell somebody go help you instead of them. Other than that there's some generally good nice hardworking people that help.  They also grown on you and become pretty good friends.
good,"over all OK , but not fixed hours all the time and sometimes dealing with mad customers but the best time part was gain more knowledge about  latest technology."
good,Good place to work and always an opportunity for overtime if youre reliable. Management is very helpful and can guide you in the right direction. Would definitely work there again.
good,"Great life and job experience, does not compensate adequately"
good,Excellent opportunities to learn about things that you may have not known before working with electronics and appliances. Be wary of having to upsell and add on to everything to increase your sales numbers.
good,"Could play video games in a game room on break. Replied to emails, made phone calls and answered the phone. Had fun Halloween costume contests. Provided meals on holidays,"
good,"Best Buy is an excellent place to work if you’re looking to move into a commission based job in the future. While it is traditional retail, you are expected to hit personal sales goals daily, including membership goals, with the potential of receiving a quarterly bonus dependent on how the store does overall. It pays well for being a retail job, but having those constant goals without any benefit to hitting them can leave you feeling unappreciated at times."
good,"Day to day was repetitive and simple, nothing to difficult or easy. I enjoyed the work environment and helping customers also the opportunity to grow and learn new things."
good,"Some days were slow while others could be very fast paced. This was usually on the weekend when most people were off work. I learned a lot of other things about computers, smart home and other things. Management was dependent on who it was. The workplace was good with the group I had. Meeting numbers at times was one of the harder things and sometimes the expectations of management when it wasn’t exactly the most feasible thing."
good,Great company to work for when they are not restructuring. Moved up in this company. Love the values and love the culture. Great pay. Equal opportunity.
good,I’ve been working here for almost a year. It is a great place to work. The managers are cool and chill. Flexible hours. They offer competitive and great pay. I’m happy to work here.
good,"Awesome but stressful experience trying to keep up with metrics and sales goals even on slow business days. Too much pressure from management to push credit card applications. Great discounts on merchandise though. As long as you get credit apps and make the store money consistently, you'll be fine."
good,"It’s a good easy job but they haven’t let me do any advancement even when I’ve been striving and asking. They’ve told me they’d put me in a management program and I could get a raise and then they forget. Besides that, great job. Fun to work there. Laid back."
good,"Best Buy has a great workplace culture that is very supportive of my movement upward in the company. There were some issues with the decisions of leadership and the incentive structure but all in all, it was a fine job."
good,"Focus on training to give employees tools to succeed. Good employee benefits package. Including healthcare, discount, life coaching, and other programs to ensure good job atmosphere."
good,Best Buy as a company was amazing to work for. However my locations management wasn’t the greatest but when I experienced other locations they were really educational.
good,"Working at Best Buy will teach you a lot of it's your first job, like it was mine. Overall though, I wouldn't describe the job as too demanding. You'll be about to cruise through your days. Just try to make friends with your peers. There are sales targets, but if you try even a bit, you'll hit them with ease. Management could get annoying, but you could just brush them off. Overall, just have fun."
good,"Overall good experience, the job is consistent. Co-workers were fine, management had their ups and downs. Little to no advancements unless you are a pet of management. I had 3 great reviews, but no foreseeable raise was in sight. Bonuses are a joke if you get one at all that is."
good,"La empresa como tal es muy buena, es un ambiente bueno pero no con todos los empleados  ya que son muy poco en trabajar en equipo, no se diga de los líderes, tienen preferencia hacia otros empleados y sino les das el ancho como ellos quieren te ponen en lista negra, sin embargo la empresa como tal te da muy buenos servicios y prestaciones, solo si tengo algo negativo que decir es hacia su personal al mando."
good,It is a very nice and flexible place to work with great benefits personally and in and outside of work. They try their best to communicate and take care of their employees.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Over the course of 13 years working for best buy. I have learned from customer service skills to being trained on becoming a supervisor. I always come 15 minutes before my shift to prepare myself so whats ahead. I make sure every unit that was brought in and client will be picking up on that day has been fully completed.
good,"There are many aspects of this job that I enjoyed. Flexible scheduling for the most part, fairly competitive salary. An atmosphere of a fun place to work and encouraging socialization with coworkers both in and out of work hours. Product knowledge was not always the most emphasize which often could lead to difficulty assisting customers unless  One was motivated to do research on their own. Sales targets were often emphasized over the customers best interests. And emphasis on signing up for credit cards and protection plans over simple short term solutions became overwhelmingly emphasize to the point of unrealistic expectations by the end of my tenure."
good,If you are looking for a job that will work with you on when you need to work then Best Buy is not a bad bet. I worked here before graduating and they were overly eager to work with me.
good,"Like any retail job it can be difficult a lot of the time. However your coworkers are diverse and friendly, so the work environment isn't bad. For part-time work this is the place to be. Full time or management and your responsibilities increase tenfold, so be prepared for that commitment."
good,"Great place to work, helped me grow. The GM is one of the best people in the world to work for. Other managers was not as approachable.I started as a part- time employee and I worked up the latter from there I enjoyed my time at best buy."
good,"You will learn a lot about retail through working at Best Buy. Good and the bad, but the company is very good about giving you plenty of resources and giving you the opportunity to succeed. If rapid movement is what you are looking for, this is the wrong place. I've worked at two stores, and both had a high percentage of people that have been in their positions for 5+ years. If you are willing to hop around stores to get promotions, that's really the only path to do it. The job culture depends store by store, and manager by manager. But they give a lot of leeway when it comes to scheduling (except during the holiday months obviously, but that's just retail)."
good,"Overall, it is a great place to work. its got friendly staff, great pay, and good benefits too. Unfortunately i had to leave due to the location closing."
good,The best thing working for Best Buy is the constant investment in technologies. There is non stop learning as the environment is dynamic. I feel I have grown up a lot in term of knowledge and I can see that there are more to absolve.
good,"Like most companies these days every few years they do a ""restructuring"" which results in higher paid employees being let go only to have job fairs weeks later to replace them. Sometimes entire departments are eliminated. I honestly should have left when I had the chance should have left when I had the chance to but the benefits and decent pay kept me there.i would recommend as a stepping stone to something to help advance your career"
good,"Best Buy's retail environment varies greatly depending on the General Manager. You might dislike one store, and love working at another. It is a fast paced goal oriented environment that expects much from it average employees. A great place to work if you are a hard worker and value company directives. Opportunities for advancement are always available within any given area."
good,"Working a 7-9 hour shift completing installation of car audio, selling as needed on the sales floor and answer questions and calls. "
good,The hard part of the job is trying to keep eyes on the whole store to make sure no one is stealing. Management is nice and at times reasonable. I enjoy all the new and returning customers that I come into contact with.
good,"Need to be sales driven. I had a good experience learned alot on the go. Sales targets sales target sales targets... "
good,Before new management took place it was great opportunity for everyone to grow and learn. A lot of people left when the new GM started and it kind of went down it just was not a healthy work life balance anymore.
good,"Management at the time was hard to get along with. I was treated disrespectfully by the assistant manager (1 of 3) and general manager (Austin)."
good,I never had a problem with my managers for the most part. The usual day consisted of me either manning the security cameras at the front door or working in the back helping with inventory.
good,Loved this job but lack of pay for the amount of work is the biggest issue. Can be extremely stressful. Especially during the holidays. Maintaining a good relationship with leadership and employees can help ease the stress.
good,"the typical day at work was basically just trying to sell protection plans to anyone who was interested in buying anything. I learned how to sell things people don""t really need and that I enjoy doing so very much. some pros were the food that they provided us during busy days and the discounts you get when you work there."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"the warehouse staff have their own click, rarely do they personally act within the rest of the team. seems like they need to learn internal customer skills, otherwise, they act like you don't exist, otherwise, they do a pretty good job restocking...."
good,Company does not try to help you get higher within the job. Management is very unprofessional. Family associates are treated better than outside associates.
good,I’ve spent a lot of time at Best Buy and I think it’s time to explore new career opportunities and see what else I can do maybe get paid a little more or work less day out of the week
good,"The culture of Best Buy is really cool if your into a more lenient cooperate/retail experience, if you are not then its not too terrible. The biggest problem is management, which is different between store to store. Management decides job security, the ability to move up, among many other things. None of those opportunities are up to you, they are out of your hands."
good,You learn about new specs and tech coming out. You become better at technology and understanding tech language. You will work with a lot of tech savvy people.
good,"Long term employees are very condescending and are why I quit.. Management was pretty jumpy, changed managers and never got to know anyones name. Good compensation for just a pt seasonal job"
good,"Basic work days involved troubleshooting people through their new purchases such as Laptops, Desktops, Phones, etc... Often times you'd sit and help them for hours. Other times you would receive complaint calls."
good,"Great place to work with great compensation and benefits."
good,"A person could work in a worse place.  Employees worked well together.  Team members from all departments were very helpful to everyone and to the customers.  I learned things about inventory control.  The hardest part of the job was getting done with work with the time allowed.  I enjoyed all the people I worked with except one.  He was a pain.  Dealt tactfully and effectively with difficult customers. Experienced in retail merchandising specializing in inventory control. Compiled reports and records. Excelled at organizing, coordinating, and managing projects."
good,We were in a terrible location and were given unrealistic goals. Manager was very inappropriate but the other employees were the main reason for staying.
good,ok place to work if you are in school. hardest  part about the job is sometimes you are all alone in the warehouse which is stressful. The workplace culture is ok.
good,This job is a standard retail sales position. As long as you can help people find what they need you have succeeded at your day. You do not need to be a brain surgeon but you need to be comfortable with the public.
good,"really nice place to work for students, teaches some good sales skills because they are really focused on selling protection plans etc, which can be annoying. really good benefits package after 6 months, salary is minimum wage, its easy to progress in the company though."
good,"Very busy and hectic work environment "
good,"Working within the computers department allowed myself to learn a lot about computers, and learn how to sell them using a variety of techniques. But, supervisors and managers don't seem like they care about their employees and don't give the opportunity to prolong employment after the end of the season."
good,Best Buy has a wonderful workplace culture. Employees are encouraged to have a balanced work/life ratio. Most managers allow flexible hours and even work remotely if needed.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Exciting products, great coworkers and a culture that embraces having fun on the job. Very flexible hours, good discounts, health benefits available, tuition reimbursement.  Overall a good place to work."
good,Very busy during holidays but when not holidays hours are cut down to minimum. Run many hours during holiday but after its like they dont care and if you arent a regular employee you are let go.
good,I had several managers and all had little experience with computers. Thankfully there were other ARA's and CA's with great knowledge. If not for the immense hard work of these agents i feel that some precincts would fold up.
good,"Flexible job for students, and room for career advancement. Constant management turnover. Difficult customers on a daily basis, which is typical in all retail, just VERY apparent at Best Buy stores."
good,"In my brief time with Best Buy Mobile, with a team of 4 consisently driving sales and having a great time doing it. Building relationships with our clients and each other was totally integral to the process of growing within the company. General Mgr was nice, albeit disconnected and more concerned with store metrics than relationship building and individual career growth."
good,Relocated from Illinois to Florida to work for the company.  Employee's and management were friendly.  Very fast paced being in a tourist area.  Slow to move up in higher positions.
good,Coworkers were friendly and easy to work with. The training opportunities were abundant and easy to advance due to restructuring. Management stand behind employees.
good,"Best Buy is a great company for young people to have for their first employer.  Some people find they love the atmosphere and find ways to continue their employment there.  Others use it as a stepping stone, make money, learn how the working world works, and use  that knowledge to decide how they want to move forward in their chosen path."
good,"Working for the Geek Squad at Best Buy was a good learning experience, having had only practical experience prior to the placement. The staff were friendly, management was fair and the culture surrounding the job was typical of any technician type job. Like any technician placement I have had in the past and post to, the best part of the job for me was tackling new computer type issues on a daily basis. There was rarely a dull moment."
good,Fast paced but you learn a lot. Great customer service experience because you literally deal with all types of customers. Good management is key. Room for career growth depending on the store size.
good,Expérience de travail enrichissante. Gens formidables.
good,"I enjoy my time as an employee here, the staff were really good, I really loved my position, the discounts were amazing. We were more like a big family and that’s the environment I believe everyone should work in."
good,"Enjoyed working at Best-Buy distribution center, unfortunately, the job was just seasonal and their was not any open positions in the shipping department where I was located at the end of the holiday season"
good,The job was fairly straightforward and compensation was very generous. Engaging with customers is a huge plus but management can sometimes be useless.
good,Great place to work for college students and students in general. The environment helps you understand how the fast-paced work environment works and opens your eyes for a better experience for higher jobs.
good,Best buy was not much different than any other retail job. They struggle to keep their employees work/life balance in check. It is better than commission jobs I have experienced though. I am passionate about many of the products and enjoyed most of my coworkers.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at Best Buy, my management team was pretty great and I think we did a really good job of making customers feel welcome. Unfortunately our store did end up closing due to rent hikes, in all honesty it was a bummer when we found out. Store 1138 treated us well."
good,"My job at Best Buy was very enjoyable and would have loved to work their longer. The people I worked with were fantastic, and still offer a warm welcome upon entering the store. However, the 'Family' aspect they tried to hold as far as employment was great until it came to management."
good,"Maximum freedom in your job at the cost of little to no job advancement, and management tries to make you think you get paid a lot but you don’t for the job you do. Poor management."
good,I had a lot of fun working here and it was very fast paced at times but everyone always kept a smile. I learned very quickly what I had to do and everyone took notice in that.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I did enjoy working at best buy."
good,"Best buy is a nice wok environment. It is a good job, especially if you are a student, they management staff works with your hours. i would recommend if you are looking to work her that you go for it."
good,Getting to know new customers and talking to my managers. The hardest part of the job is hitting sales target when we have a really slow day. The most enjoyable part is getting to work with others as a team and getting to learn more about technology.
good,"I worked for the company for 9 years, through the years I saw senior employees learning how to be more efficient due to new work class not being able to pull weight. HR and the 23 and under workforce basically hold the business back and make it impossible to manage, teach or even instruct corrective action without having an investigation take place."
good,"Car audio is the unloved child of Best Buy, no dedicated or even remotely educated sales staff forcing installers to spend more time selling than installing."
good,work environment was good and the staff was friendly. never had an issue with the manager but the pay was kind of low to be honest. I would recommend working here
good,"Good work environment, flexible scheduling and understanding of school and extracurriculars. Employees are friendly, and willing to help others when needed."
good,"When I was first interviewed and introduced to this position, it was presented as a Full Time job, which is what I was looking for."
good,its good for someone out of high school or in college but unless you have great numbers and a good relationship with management you wont be able to progress in the company.
good,My manager wasn't really all that nice of a guy. My coworkers were very fake and said a lot of bad things about other coworkers. Often times at Best Buy you will see the employees that have been working with the company pick on the new hires.
good,The only issue I had was the favoritism when it came to the veteran workers who got the lighter loads as a post to the newcomers getting all the heavier loads
good,a great experience overall and such a nice work environment but I would say that it needs better pay for the employees and better management around the year.
good,"Geek Squad runs a very tight ship. Fun job. I was there for over nine years. They strive to keep the best employees. The down side is that it is still within the Best Buy store, so retail stuff seeps in -- but that's not so bad. Best Buy is probably the best big-box store to work at,"
good,"We would review sale goals for the day and utilize ""Top Down"" selling to achieve goals given to us on a day to day and monthly sales goals. Was InCharge of assisting with teaching ""Top Down"" selling to achieve higher goals."
good,It was a very good company to work for until they sent in new management and in one year the store closed due to poor leadership. I learned a lot of who I was and could do from that position.
good,"All in all, best buy is a good company to work for. Lots of chances to move up depending on the state you live in. Pay is below average based on the amount of revenue that an individual can sell and the stress to reach their sometimes unrealistic hourly goals is a downside, but the team environment and friendly coworkers make it a fun place to work at."
good,"the job is decent, you have to be comfortable working in retail and being a salesperson. if that is ok, then you'll do fine. the pay was adequate, but my store was often down sized so hours are hard to get."
good,Fun yet competitive work that encourages you to be the best in your environment. Now that is a good and bad thing because far too often are numbers not perfect metrics for your work performance.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Overall,"
good,Time flies because you are always helping a variety of different clients. Everyday is different and keeps you on your feet. Your communication skills grow over the course of time you are there.
good,workplace culture was enjoyable and a typical day was selling to meet a weekly sales quota during the holiday season. I enjoyed the familiar faces from high school but I felt wasn't socially accepting of new employees. I personally felt certain people in management was constantly watching me on a regular basis like I was going to steal something. It was uncomfortable at times so I tried to engage in conversation asking them why they were constantly watching me but they would just walk away before I could ask them. Ultimately I felt viewed as a disposable seasonal employee and ended up getting let go.
good,"The job is very productive. As an inventory specialist, I was always on my feet and completing tasks. Coworkers were very friendly. There was never any problems in the work community. The management is okay, they did little but supervise. The hardest part of the job is the late truck hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is that there is always something to do so time really does fly."
good,"Best Buy offers you a flexible schedule with reasonable sales goals. It is a great company to work for for those first entering the sales world, to those advanced in sales seeking advancement in a retail company."
good,"I gained a lot of Skills, Knowledge and Wisdom working at best buy . We often had  training sessions where they kept us motivated in sales and customer service and provided us with lots of learning  materials to advance our skills.It was actually called UP Skilling !!  I was really impressed with the amount of skills I obtained at the end of my time with Best Buy and NCO. A typical day consists of taking inbound calls for the best buy project I was assigned to. Either Geek Squad Tech support or Magnolia Home Theater and Appliance Sales.The culture of the workplace was geared towards, productivity in a timely fashion and meeting sales goals.The hardest part of my job was balancing life situations with the company cuts backs and lay offs .The most enjoyable part of my job was being of service, meeting,and talking to people, daily from all over America ."
good,"Overall the work environment was fun, fast paced and demanding, but still fun. The collaboration of teams was great, probably the best part of working at Best Buy."
good,Every day I would show up to work in a positive atmosphere. I Enjoy working for the company. Best Buy really helps me continue to strive to do my best each day.
good,"Bestbuy as a whole is a okay place to work."
good,"Fast paced store with a lot of stress on management. Upper management are quick to point out faults but offer no help to improve store performance. Great people working at store level that do not get fair recognition for their efforts. Pay and benefits are outstanding, but not worth the amount of stress."
good,Would definitely recommend to anyone needing extra holiday money and good clean working environment.  Heated and air conditioned building is a definite plus if you're not used to working without.
good,"I learned deskside manner and variety in repair - great for that. However, a lot of the troubleshooting is done via disks, automation, and shipping out. Education outside of the role is key for breaking away."
good,"This is a very fast-paced and competitive environment. I enjoyed working here and learned a lot about technology. Mid-Management can be very trying, however, incentives make up for their lack of interpersonal skills."
good,"During my time at best buy, they had a very good work environment which made going to fun enjoyable. Everyone was treated equally and fairly. Overall it was enjoying working at bestbuy and being apart of the team."
good,Working at the Geek Squad provides a great entry point into computer repair and the culture around the company is great!  However there is not much room for advancement and make sure you ask up front for a good starting wage.
good,Fun place to work if you are just starting out. Culture can vary from store to store. Lots of various attitudes and people in one environment can make objectives difficult in big box stores.
good,"I learned a great deal of new skills during my time at Best Buy.  How to manage and meet sales goals, The ins and outs of the audio/visual field.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was successful in solving our customer's problems."
good,"I like it , management lacks professionalism from store level to corporate, sometimes the environment is high school ish but the overall mannerism is authentic"
good,"Cool or fun place to work if you enjoy technology. Sometimes you have to deal with irate or unruly customers, but over the experience is just fine for an entry level job that sometimes requires you to work weekends and holidays."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I love BestBuy but I believe an honest review only helps everyone. BestBuy performs well because they focus on numbers heavily. They are not flexible with work hours due to retail environment and management is terrible because they tend punish employees over poor performance instead of a positive approach, So the culture stinks."
good,"Best Buy gave me a chance to work in something that I enjoy, Electronics. I enjoy the new technology that the company brings out through their products. If I had the chance I would work with them again. I had a good mgr who was easy to get along with a did not mine teaching you the things need to be successful at the job."
good,"I enjoyed my work at Best Buy. The store was one mile from where I live, so I would often walk to work. I liked selling electronics and dealing with mostly older customers presented some unique challenges that made my days interesting."
good,Not much room for advancement for a student going into CIS. Great company to work for during high school. Great employee discount if you are into buying tech.
good,i enjoy this company definitely a starter job i personally didn’t see room for job growth but some may differ and i’ve been there over 5 years i do however love the work culture
good,Best Part of Best Buy was the employee discount and the exciting new product that we would be able to play with first before customers.  Allowing us the hands on experience was not only fun but gave us better information to help answer customer questions.
good,"Great place to work , pay is low for the amount of work you have to put in . "
good,it was ok but i had to relocate for more money. really dont have anything else to say about it anybody else trying to aply should do so if you like face paced work
good,This is a large big box retail store. Many different opportunities of work from cashier to sales floor work. Great education of products for employees to create the best shopping experience possible.
good,"Had lots of fun updating stock and unboxing new tech, Seeing new Televisions and Mobile Phones before anyone else was fantastic, learning about the new tech is always exciting"
good,"I was Part-Time at Best Buy during both times there.  Even though I was eventually a Geek Squad Agent in Council Bluffs, IA.  I was never able to get on as a Geek Squad Agent in Papillion, NE.  I found that strange...as I had more than a year of Geek Squad experience."
good,Great job to start out your customer service background and to receive excellent training on providing customers a stress free purchase. Unrealistic daily sales goals based on traffic sometimes.
good,"Enjoyed my time there. Co-workers were friendly and professional. Good balance of fun and work. "
good,"Enjoyed the company, spent nine years and grew many of my management skills there. The company works well for its Team Members, and has a good culture."
good,"Good place to work for most of the time, he manager can make or break your store. People are good to work with also. Pay Scale while i was working there was a little messed up, hopefully by now it has been fixed."
good,A job at Best Buy can be challenging and rewarding. With so many positions its easy to climb the ladder if you buy into the Best Buy way. A lot of easy going people and it’s fun.
good,"Just felt like no one cared when I worked there, management wasn't great to me, so I worked there for about two months and continued my career in banking,"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Any retail job is stressful due to customer interactions but most of the people that I worked with were smart, fun, and hard workers, which made it a much easier time."
good,It is a quick paced job. You have to be very flexible with your availability which makes it hard for you to do things like go to church or have a weekend day off unless requested. It is a fun environment for the most part
good,"Best Buy was a fun place to work. Always have access to the latest in electronics and technology. Work life balance for a sales manager is average, working around 50 hours a week"
good,"Your experience will vary greatly on who your managers and coworkers are. Since Geek Squad primarily hires college students with minimal experience, it's a wild gamble on how reliable your coworkers might be. Those who perform well are generally recognized and have the opportunity to advanced, but you might have to change stores often to get into the position you want."
good,"Promotions never happened too much internally. Management hired from outside sources. Also, didn't leave too much room for other parts of your life, like school, etc."
good,"Working for best buy as a sales associate was a fantastic first job. But honestly, I was tapped out looking for another after 2 years. But I would recommend working for the company."
good,"Best Buy has made strides in reversing the big box trend of retail and has done an admirable job of increasing revenue in the world of Amazon.  As far as the day to day job, it all depends on what position you have."
good,"Flexible work environment with a drive for sales. Not for everyone, but not a bad place to work. Team culture and fun meetings help get you by. Its a retail job, but as far as those go, it was one of my favorites. I still go back in to see my former coworkers as there is a really good bond."
good,"I worked at Best Buy during Black Friday and throughout Christmas. Management was great with pairing up white shirts with blue shirts. [Blue shirts are hired on employees, white shirts are the newbies.] The only downfall was after Christmas, work got super slow so they let all of the seasonal people go."
good,"While it does range from store to store, Best Buy is a great company to start working for in terms of learning about technology and sales. Additionally, you get very flexible hours and time off based on your position. Although the only problems I have with the company are the management for which they play the favoritism game and have EXTREMELY unrealistic expectations in terms of selling to customers."
good,Interact with customers and discuss potential options for customers keeping their best interests in mind. During downtime it is imperative to restock and ensure the floor is clean and tidy.
good,"Best Buy is a good company to work for if you are looking for a part time job."
good,"I can't speak for all best buy, but the Best Buy I worked the management team had no people skills and ran the store with an iron fist. Yes the store did hit bonus but that was because there was a good team despite management."
good,Lots of opportunity for learning and growth. Advancement can be challenging as there were often no objective measures of performance. Politics is important.
good,"Best job for me as a teenager. As a college student, they were flexible with my hours and were always willing to working with me and my schedule. Would recommend this job for any teenager."
good,Best Buy was a good place to start out in the workplace. The job consisted of a mix of retail sales and computer repair that will set you up to work with customers to find them the product they need.
good,"Good place to work for, the employees get along together for the most part. Down side is working alot during the holidays, longer day and overtime is a plus."
good,"Schedule changes weekly"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,My overall experience with the Best Buy company was impactful to the betterment of my customer service skills. I was able to communicate with peoples of different backgrounds in order to meet their electronic needs. I was also able to make great acquaintances through working for Best Buy!
good,Pretty stressful with unrealistic time constraints.  Clients are very abusive even especially if they don't understand what the issues is. Work place culture is a lot of fun and relaxed when it isn't too busy.  Management does their best but sometimes seems like there is favoritism.
good,"If you like working with the latest technology and selling to other technology lovers, this is a great job. I wouldn't recommend working at the holiday season though."
good,You get out what you put in. I spent a lot of time not putting in the work and I got nothing out. If you commit yourself to do good everywhere you go and do everything in your power to help the business thrive; then you will thrive.
good,"Best is a fun place to work at with the people that you are working with, but once it comes to management its a show. I loved working with my coworkers. Management was do able when you either were on their good side or you got the numbers they wanted, but if not you don't get hours."
good,I was younger. It was a great place. It Taught me a lot about what i know today. I came in being a good talker and left knowing how to talk. There is a difference.
good,I enjoyed the fast pace but I did not want to stay there. I wanted a job where I could have weekends with my family and set working hours. The schedule was always changing.
good,"its a entry level job with not much thinking involved. its very routine, nothing really changes. the customers have the same issues and its a very rinse and repeat atmosphere."
good,Normal days at work are slow paced with rushes every now and then. They day goes by fast with the fun co workers but the managers are a little unreasonable some times.
good,Best buy es excelente empresa la cual tiene un ambiente laboral excelente la cual es muy padre el trabajo y muy ameno
good,"Best Buy has a well developed organization with training that is required for every employee, subject to the particular area in which the individual is working.  The training is good.  However, again, the job is a basic floor sales associate role.  Promotions are very possible.  The people are pleasant to work with."
good,Overall and decent company learned a lot of information regarding technology and how it works in the modern world. First experience working black friday in a retail industry great opportunity to learn customer service and sales knowledge in busy work environments.
good,"Honestly one of the best places I've had the pleasure at working. Fun environment, no stress. I would go into work each day smiling knowing whats ahead. Management really helps if you're having trouble learning something and team members jump at opportunities to help one another."
good,"It is an easy going place to work, except for holiday or when district/cooperate visits because Management gets Nervous. I leaned how to interact better with customers and maintain a healthy schedule and workload in order to be efficient."
good,"A typical day at work will be knowing what to do as soon as I clock in, once I am done with the first task it is on to the next, if any associate or customers needs assistance I stop what I am doing and help them out as much and soon as I can. Management makes sure everything is done correctly and time efficient. The hardest part of my job is just trying to stay busy once all is done, I usually go to my management and ask if they need certain tasks done. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to see everyone and help each other out with whatever it is."
good,The discount you receive does benefit you greatly and can offset the low pay that they provide. Much like any retail job every store is different and the leadership will play a factor in how successful day to day operation is.
good,"If you have the right supervisor that can keep you focused on hittinga goal, but also make it fun to work everyday, Best Buy is a great place to work."
good,"I enjoyed working there until the location was shutdown by corp. The management team could improve in many areas, however the team members are fun and entertaining."
good,"L'expérience BEST BUY a été pour moi très constructive, et épanouissante , j'ai pu développer mes compétences et les mettre à profit au-prés des différents clients à qui j'ai eu à faire."
good,"It's as good as a retail job can get.     It's competitive, cooperative environment demanding discipline and self control.  The jobs are easy to perform and easy to not do well."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,It was a great family-oriented environment where every employee got along and enjoyed working hard & efficiently for customer demands. We created a partnership with the company and employees to achieve great satisfaction.
good,Busy workplace with often times unrealistic goals. Average day is usually busy with up to 25 personal client meetings. No clear way to guide lines on how to do certain things. Often tiering due to lack of coverage.
good,"Best Buy is a wonderful place to work. But it demands flexibility in your schedule. For me, it was difficult to plan my life around an always shifting work schedule."
good,If you come to work and do you job and try you will succeed.and also you have to be able to work with different personality on a daily basis including co worker s
good,Great people. Lots of opportunity to learn and grow. Management is satisfactory with room for improvement. Compensation is fair to some degree with the possibility to receive bonuses.
good,I think Best buy is good place for part-time job. You can learn couple thing about electronic too. There are some employee discount which is better than internet deal.
good,"Good place to work, but they can make you feel like company is in dire straits. They use a very unethical way for wages and raises. Management is overall good, but they seem to ask employees for business ideas, and reap the benefits of ideas given."
good,I like working here. There is plenty of room for advancement if you push yourself. I love the people I work with and my manager is always very helpful.
good,"It is a great place to work if you have the right managers and staff, but isn't a long term job if you don't plan on moving up in the company. The employees are nice but you have to have a lot of patience when working in retail."
good,It was a great place to learn and be around the things I loved. The employee discounts where great. The teamwork and friends made were great and the management even was very enjoyable to deal with. The job isn't always fun but if you enjoy electronics and love talking about them then its the perfect place to set up shop. There is almost no room for advancement unless you send quite a long time there. Hours can be long. Black Friday is always fun.
good,Been there for almost 2 and half years great staff to work with and management as always been good and great products and benfits on discounts on the items
good,"Anything that you did was never enough. Even if you push their credit cards or geek squad savings plan it’s never enough for management. Selling 12,000 in one transaction with what they call “full solution “ still never enough."
good,"Is a really good job to start as a highschooler maybre a bit into college, but to become a lead they will force you to focus only on work, and they stop caring about your school etc."
good,The manager of the store had an unfavorable approach to a situation.  It wasn't ideal to deal with how an interaction with an employee occurred. The freedom of the casual workday was actually preferred though.
good,"A job at best buy typically keeps you busy. there is very little downtime between selling products, maintaining the store and training. Associates are typically personable and helpful. Overall the environment is very team oriented. The hardest part of the job is occasional interactions with uncooperative customers. The best part about the job is being a part of a very family-like team."
good,"solid job during college or to learn networking/AV. Good for beginners. management is all about training and quality. During college, the best buy employee discount, and pay is awesome."
good,"Best Buy offers flexible schedules and a good work life balance for the most part"
good,easy going sales environment without the stress of commissions when I worked there.  fantastic first job that allowed me to explore my strengths and weaknesses as an employee.
good,"Usually I don't care about sales jobs, but they understood my needs and helped me feel comfortable in the environment. Part-time wasn't enough for me to sustain myself, as expected."
good,"Best buy is a fun place to work, where many relationships are built. Good team culture. Could use better training though on products. Pay should be more competitive"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Not a bad job, good management, coworkers are nice, decent pay, not sure on benefits or time off......................................................"
good,i worked with alot of friendly people they became like family. best buy is definitely a company that likes to keep all their employees well educated and compensated for their time.
good,A typical work day consist of assisting customers with product needs and questions along with cleaning and stocking product as needed. You get to constantly learn as technology continues to grow and change year over year.
good,"was doing this while going to college for my AAS degree. management was awful. colleagues didnt really care and a lot of people moved on. turnover rate was pretty high."
good,Most of the people you work with there were great. I even had some managers I loved working with. Unfortunately there were a couple managers that I and many other people couldn't stand. But other then that it was a great place.
good,"Best Buy is a place in which employees are seen as a means to an end, as in most companies. This company uses its employee's desire for bonuses to drive sales, and reprimands them when numbers are not where they should be. The numbering system as provided by Best Buy is very unfair, and all employees get punished for slow traffic or days in which no one buys anything big."
good,"Paid well for a retail jobs, well trained and developed sales culture.  Little room for advancement as company ""restructures"" every few years due to competition of online sales and other retailers. Being interviewed and put into a full time position was considered a promotion."
good,"Not a lot of opportunity for advancement, due to the small size of the store. Part time employees are not offered any benefits, including, insurance, bereavement, personal time or any type of paid time off."
good,My day at best buy usually consist of price tagging and fulfilling dot com orders as an Inventory Specialist. I would also be out on the floor placing products and helping customers find products. It was really fun and I spent most of my time with the warehouse staff which were a group of awesome people who were willing to assist and support me.
good,Best buy is a fun work environment but over time it becomes very dull and repetitive nothing new ever happens and Management doesnt stand true to their word
good,"While my time was minimal, the experience has helped me through my professional life in many ways. A worthy experience for anyone working retail and customer service."
good,Great place to work for anyone who is looking for their first job or for students. Management can get in the way at times but atmosphere is fun and exciting. Great benefits and the employees always makes it a fun day at work.
good,"Lideres comprometidos con sus empleados, mucha humanidad"
good,"I worked unloading trucks and stocking store during the holiday season. My supervisor was awesome and helped me whenever i asked. My manager was a good guy and always made me feel welcome. The downside is the hours you have to work are outside the normal workday usually at night and early mornings before, during, and after store closed"
good,"Management is strict but fair, not much room for advancement. Filled with culture and diversity and not long after feels like family. You get to learn a great deal about current and upcoming technology."
good,Best Buy IT is a fast-pace work place.  Project teams varies widely in their software testing tools and procedures.  Some teams made up mainly with offshore contractors using Waterfall development processes while others are implementing Agile Scrum with mainly onshore workers.
good,Best Buy is higher end retail but its still retail. Management is either unqualified to lead to people or too busy focused on their own business to really understand and guide employees.
good,"Being in the computer department for roughly 3 years, I have been exposed to MANY different kinds of people, all of whom have helped me to have better client-facing skills. The new influx of technology every so often force me to learn and adapt to newer methods of efficiency, thus helping my career outside of Best Buy. The work culture is also exemplary, as you are encourage to learn as much as you can and to apply it in helping others succeed as well."
good,Always something to do to keep busy and will always know what is to come workload wise each week. No need to worry about what will be done the following day.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"No matter the day or attitude you get, you'll leave the work place with a smile on your face.everyone is willing to help you out with what you need. never doubt in that best buy in signal hill if anything everyone will be apart of work events that go on no one is left behind there."
good,"I have very few complaints about my time as a Geek Squad Agent. The customers aren't always cooperative, and management tends to sometimes work against the better interests of work productivity, but the culture and learning opportunities were fantastic."
good,Best Buy is politics that really run some stores and  career advancement is hard unless you've been in the business 5-10 years or you're really liked within the store. Management is iffy a lot of days but Best Buy pays the bills but just don't ask for more that what you're offered.
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work at.  Great employee discounts, and flexible on shifts.  Great place to work for a student or under graduate. Great experience."
good,"The management and Sales team were constantly at odds with each other, one needed goals to hit and one couldn't hit the goals for a plethora of reasons"
good,Overall experience was positive. Professional environment and invested time and money on making work environment fun for it employees. Management at times had too much on their plates.
good,Bonne entreprise mais salaire trop bas pour ce qu'on doit faire
good,Great work place I wish I could've stayed longer.  I started working here through a temp agency no  have of getting hired on too many employees already
good,"Despite not being paid on commission from sales, there are still sales numbers that each individual employee had to meet on a daily and weekly basis. The biggest problem that I had was that sales associates were constantly hounded to do whatever it takes to reach those sales, even if it meant annoying a customer. There is a required sales training that all sales associates must go through, and there is always more training available to the employee in various forms. "
good,"Most of my experience with BestBuy was tarnished by bad leadership. Pay wasn't great, discount was awesome, management left some to be desired. Membership was also difficult as I worked with BestBuy while the company was at a technology crossroads, now days, it has a completely different workflow and culture, so bright futures a head."
good,"I've learned a lot at best buy. How to communicate with others, how to work while being the best and have fun while being the best. How to have patience."
good,Its like a family. Turn over is low and its a great place to work. the company values is what drives the culture of good service. Sale goal is what drives the staff everyday. They meet those challenges and set a higher level for themselves everyday.
good,I learned a lot from working at Best Buy. I feel as though I was able to carry what I learned from Best buy to my current Job. I would recommend it to someone who enjoys sales and or someone who is looking to get customer service experience
good,"Good place to work, normal type of job, people were fun to work with, nothing super special about the work there. I would recommend it to a person that needed a job."
good,"Best Buy was a good temporary part-time job for when I has a college student. However, I would not recommend for someone who is looking for something long-term."
good,"It was great to work for Vivint, it was a tough job but i learned a lot and met some great people along the way as well as learned a lot of skills when it came to talking with people and making a sale"
good,"Job duties where repetitive , lacked creative thinking and was mondane , Productivity was ok, in conclusion it was dull and boring if you have a competitive or creative personality. Perfect job to learn structure and master discipline."
good,"So far the best company i have worked for. I would definitely recommend Best Buy to anyone. You must be driven, open to learn new things, and be a good salesman."
good,"Working with customers to identify their needs,  I worked in every department from tv's to cameras, I was a high seller and sold on average 10,000 plus a day"
good,Had a set schedule. Was always learning something different. Very easy to advance. Had to make sure you are always on time and not calling off. Very strict on that. Fun place to work and awesome employees.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Typical work day consists of finding jobs to do around the store. Lately there has not been a whole lot of foot traffic to sell product to customers. Culture is fantastic! Excellent people work for Best Buy.
good,"Through development of leaders and team members, I oversee all aspects of sales and operations business.  Engage in a positive work environment while ensuring to develop individual communication skills, including my own."
good,The economy is killing this place.I like the place but I didn't have many work hours.Management was the best I ever had in retail.The workers cared and worked hard.Its a great partime job if you are a student or need extra income.
good,"If you love working with multiple types and brands of technology, then Best Buy is your place. Geek Squad has an amazing culture.  As a field agent, I have the ability to work with many different technologies from home theater equipment to networking as well as personal computers."
good,"The work place was good and left with a good experience. I wish I would've gotten more hours but, overall I enjoyed the experience I had. Most days were busy because I worked a holiday season but, that was expected. Hardest part of the job was trying to sell Geek Squad protection because most customers did not want it and I feel as though that had an effect on me keeping the job."
good,Moved up fairly quickly. Good culture. Sometimes felt like babysitting children. If you execute the company play you will do well. Management schedules are a burden. It's tough to both support your family and actually get to see them.
good,best buy was a cool place to work. i was lucky to work with a good team but unless you are just needing extra class its for college students to work because the mandatory schedule requirements became ridiculous
good,"My actual employer was Anderson Merchandiser."
good,"Es una empresa que si hace lo posible por cumplir con sus valores, es muy bueno como primer empleo, aprendes mucho y no juzgar tus errores, todo es muy relajado y te logras llegar muy bien con todos, hice muy buenos amigos y todos nos apoyabamos entre si, nunca hubo malos entendidos ni malas interacciones entre compañeros. "
good,"I enjoyed my work there. I learned how to handle or promote your own brand. Management no issue. Workplace and culture also good. The most enjoyable part of my job, here I learned many things and get confident to enter each and every market without fear and there is no shy about to do logistic in this company because I consider this is my company and try maximum to close more and more order & support to deliver goods by myself to customers at earliest rather than waiting for pick up or courier person."
good,"great place to work to gain some experience in the IT field, unfortunately Bestbuy doesn't pay nearly what the work is worth. "
good,"For the technology industry that is rapidly changing , Best Buy is a fun place to work at , standards and salary are all average and normal , co-workers were fun , others not so much as in every workplace environment , It was fun meeting new customers , and talking to new people , and a personal gratification knowing the customers walked out happy with my service , and helping them get what they needed , I did not enjoy the cash handling part as it sometimes gets confusing keeping track of the money coming in or out sometimes , especially during holidays when I was hired , I liked the more face to face part where I helped customers with there questions and issues , the only downside to my experience was not getting hired on after my seasonal contract was over and the management at the time was not very pleasing , overall I would recommend Best Buy as a good employer."
good,"Standard retail job with a little more focus on sales. Learn about new technology and demo cool products to the customers. Staff tends to get close knit, family-like atmosphere."
good,"Overall great environment, friendly staff.  Learned a lot about new computers, phones, and tablets. Learned about repairing certain software and up-selling electronics on the sales floor."
good,"Working for Geek Squad is awesome.  I love working with my Co-workers.  It has been the best job I have since I graduated from college 10 years ago.  Although I am overqualified for the position I still work there because it is fun to go to work.  With that said, I have come to understand it is all about who your supervisor is and how buddy buddy you can be. In with your boss, life is great.  Get a new supervisor or your supervisor just does love you that much, it becomes a terrible job that they can hour you out very quickly."
good,You will start off with the basics as a C.A. Then you will move on to ARA this is the meat of the IT field where you will learn and observe everything
good,"Very stuck in the mode of if you haven't done it, you can't do it.  Many positions share workload which is not distributed evenly.  Employees that choose to do less get away with it.  The managers I have worked for have been poor across the board."
good,Best Buy is fun place to work.  The holiday hours are terrible.  That is why I left.  The managers were great.  The other employees were great.  The customers can sometimes be hard to deal with.
good,i love it there but the only issue i have right now is that i rarely get over 10 hours of work. i do not know what the issue is with scheduling but i wish it was better
good,"Its a job where you are constantly learning about new tech. My day would consist of continuing the work on a open ticket, and resolve the issue until its exceeds the clients expectations. I would also have to troubleshoot clients devices, and based on the issue open a ticket."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I was a vehicle installer for several locations, and I loved the skills that I learned and the interaction with customers.  I am still using what I learned today."
good,"Good place to work, very understanding manager and flexible scheduling.I get paid weekly, and it is a nice place to keep your customer service skills at ease."
good,Standard Retail experience at BestBuy. Issues of management focusing hard on employees meeting sales requirements with no potential gain to the employees. Management however got an all expense paid trip to Jamaica.
good,"Good leadership in corporate level"
good,"Fun place to work with great energy.  Not a great place to work during the holidays but you get extra hours.  Great opportunity to be promoted.  Can learn all about electronics, cameras, computers."
good,I worked there for years. It’s cool to see New tech. Before it comes out but if you don’t know anyone in management it’s almost impossible to move up. Discount is great. Can get competitive for nothing. You have numbers that you have to keep up with but since you aren’t on commission it’s pointless. It only benefits the managers’ pockets in the long run.
good,"it is an easy job, the hours are flexible,"
good,"worked there for over a year and never got a raise not on my anual and we dont get compensated for minimum wage going up overall good place low hours,"
good,"Good place to work part time."
good,Overall atmosphere is great. Best part of the job is the people I work with. They can make or break the job to be completely honest. Management team varies upon the store you are in. I will say district staff does care about progression within the company more than the store level management. A few things that could be a turn off would be the clients that come in. Most of them are pretty straightforward. However there are plenty of days where some clients feel entitled and that they deserve better discounts and will beg you to give them a better discount on products because of the price and then it creates and awkward vibe between you and the client. But other than that we have great partnerships with our vendors so sometimes we can receive special accommodations on product if the vendor wants the employee to own the product to sale it.
good,"I worked as a cashier helping the customers with their purchases.  I then worked at the Customer Service counter where I would also assist the customers with their returns and exchanges.  Then I worked as the Asset Protection Associate.  In this position I would monitor the store cameras and check the customers purchases as they left the store."
good,Great company with lots of great people.  The store employees are the hardest working I've ever encountered.  The culture is competitive but fun for the most part.  Ability for growth isn't what it was in the past when they were in serious growth mode  Benefits are great and the pay is very competitive.
good,"As a Home Theater Sales Associate, I enjoyed interacting with the customers and finding the best technological fit for them. We were urged to push the 4k televisions and had to meet minimum sales quotas which were easily surpassed."
good,"A typical day at work consist of checking out customers, and also offering them a Best Buy Credit Card and offering different discounts to go along if a customer signed up for the credit card. Also helping customers find things around the store."
good,Overall working there has given me a whole new perspective on customers. There are customers who are patient and can work with you. There are other customers who can be rude and obnoxious. Management wise it can be better. There are some moments where they have a good day on sales and there are some bad days where they push you to shark around for sales.
good,Good place to work. Nice people. Digital space is the open environment work area for ease of collaboration and positive atmosphere. Would recommend to others.
good,Best Buy was a great experience for me. I had to leave because I got a better opportunity with more hours. If I could’ve got the hours that I get at Walmart I would’ve loved to stay.
good,"Fast pass, slightly competitive. Coworkers are nice but lazy. Hard to get things done and communication is poor between management and employees. Nice people to work with."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I worked for them briefly.  It was over all a positive experience. The  managers were helpful,  the store was clean, and the paycheck arrived on time."
good,"I started out in a seasonal position with the opportunity to stay on board after the holiday season. The general manager that was there when I started was extremely nice, understanding, and pleasant to work with. After she was transferred to another location, the job became unbearable. The new gm had set unrealistic expectations of the employees and had an extremely unpleasant demeanor. Other employees would steal customers from you. I was treated like I was incompetent any time I would ask a question."
good,Great family environment that is very demanding. Matching customers differing needs on a daily basis while helping/improving employees grow is a daily challenge that brings it's own reward.
good,"Sell consumer electronics to prospective customers."
good,The best part about working at Best Buy is the ability to check out new technology on the market. The second best part about working at Best Buy are the discounts off of certain products (not all products garner the employee discount). Working at Best Buy can be an extremely stressful job due to the numerous personalities that come in and out of the store.
good,It was a very professional work environment where all co workers were very generous. The job overall was great but the HR department was the downfall of the job.
good,"all and all, an okay company to work for if looking to further advance career in a short amount of time. Down fall was team members drive to  want to advance in their careers at the store."
good,I enjoyed my time at best buy.  I loved my coworkers and my managers.  The environment was clean and organized.  I enjoyed the work and the discounts for employees were great.
good,"Best Buy is a nice place to work for your first time, especially if you have experience with technology. However, in my experience, you're not really going to get anywhere working there. Not a lot of people get promoted, and often, it was the people least deserving of a promotion, though that may just have been poor management."
good,Best buy was a fun place to work only because you stay fairly busy and the management is good. they are fun and like their employees and treat them well.
good,"Good part time job to keep you busy and learn new information about electronics. Management is subpar for the most part, and advancement opportunities are few and far between. The discount is great, work-life balance is solid, and the people you work with are good people."
good,Cool place to work at especially if management is good. Benefits here are amazing somethings you get a discount off and you see the price after make you say why didn't i start working here years ago.
good,Typical retail job.  I was lucky to have a good manager.  Very busy during new phone launches.  Target goals continued to get increasingly higher the better our division did.  Overall a decent job and would recommend for high school or college students.
good,It is a fun place to work with a lot of benefits. The only con is that it requires a lot of work at times.  Overall my experience at Best Buy has been a great one.
good,"I loved working there for the most part. The only major down fall was my floor manager. He was very rude, condescending and misogynistic. He would toss papers on the desk vs handing them to me, snap his fingers and talk down to women like they were his children."
good,Pay is bad but it is what it is. If you enjoy working with old people this is the job for you. Its mostly just appeasing people who have no idea how to work a computer.
good,Woking at Best Buy was a good experience. It was a fun place to work and I learned a lot about all kinds of electronics. The management was good. Overall I enjoyed my time there and working with my coworkers.
good,My time at Best Buy was spent helping customers unlock the power of their technology . Whether it was something as simple as making a playlist for their Ipod or setting virus software for their laptop I believed in the best for our customers .
good,The people are nice and it is a good and okay paced environment to be in. Managment is good. Everyone gets along well. Great chances to move to different departments.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The culture is great the guys are really fun to work with we have a good time to get a lot done the day goes quickly And there's a lot to do but not too much that she can't get things done.
good,"Better pay will be good but over all nice place to work if you are going to school. Good discount after you be there more then 90 days, hard getting full time"
good,"Best Buy was one of the most fun jobs i worked. There is always something going on that keeps you as an employee motivated to work harder, the pay for the most part when your are hired matches your worth to them at that time. The only thing with Best Buy is they always feel that ""you"" the employee is stealing. There is always this uneasy feeling that someone is watching you, which they are. Mobile department has the best perks but hardest job in my eyes."
good,At Best Buy I was a sales consultant under the Mobile area. I helped customers with their cell phone needs. I would sometimes venture out and help out other departments as well.
good,"Usually consistent of bunch of college students. Management are usually younger and easier to talk to. You can usually request days off anytime other than holidays."
good,"Best Buy was a very fun job, high energy paced job. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to create lasting relationships with customers. Management did play favorites quite a bit, and favored other employees, even if they were less productive."
good,You get the opportunity to sell some of the best consumer electronics. It is rewarding to help someone get a new product they love. Great for college kids.
good,"High inbound call volume"
good,"Depends on how well your management team is preforming around the values and customer promises as to if you will enjoy this job or not. If you have good leadership it's a very fun and challenging workplace. If not, then you will dread everyday of it."
good,"Fun, nice environment. Management listens to you. Everyone that works there is pretty friendly and have the same hobbies it seems like. It's a very clean place to work."
good,"management staff very professional, took some time to learn micromanagement style. i come from commissioned sales back ground, which was a little more independent."
good,I don't mind working there.  People are great.  It's a second home.  Can be stressful and overwhelming because the work is never complete.  Every day seems to repeat itself.
good,It was a good work environment that allowed you to work with customers giving them the best customer service you could provide by making sure they recieve the product they were looking for and leaving with knowledge of what they purchased.
good,"Overall, it is a great team, but the culture seems to be stuck in the past still.  Great benefits, but not as flexible as I would expect a large corporate technology environment to be."
good,just like in my subject line the people there are great but the job as a whole is terrible i work in the warehouse and when you dont sell anything you arent really worth anyhting to the company.
good,Outsourced over 400 jobs to India.The job had a great salary and decent training. The benefits were not world class but were better than nothing. Working from home was nice.
good,"Best Buy is a massive electronics retailer with Geek Squad as the massive support team behind the sales. I was part of the remote support team that provided 24/7 support to our clients. In this position, management was fair, and fun to work with. The culture was excellent, as long as it lasted. The hardest part was working with clients that expected work to be done remotely that wasn't possible. We sent those clients into the store, or offered an Agent out to the home. The most enjoyable part was the gratitude from clients when we completed the work on their computers."
good,"Pas de formation très stricte, on apprend sur le tas"
good,Best Buy has an amazing atmosphere to work within but I feel that advancement through the company really comes down to playing favorites for management and not by those who actually demonstrate the core values of the company while improving work conditions for other employees.In my time working for the company I have made friends but there is more to just being a good salesmen or women that should affect the choices made by management for this company. As well as for the most part everything is pretty fair however it can be stressful at times when hours go by slow and hours get cut all the way around
good,Worked there for a while. not willing to balance my schedule with 2 jobs so I left for my career. could be managed better in the one store.  Would go back if they could work with me on scheduling
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy taught me more about business and management and working with others than any other job in my life. The dynamic of working with professionals as well as young people who are just looking for a part time job is one of the most challenging aspects of the company. Every year the corporate teams roll out some new sales process for everybody to learn and this is one of the most frustrating aspects of the company, the fact that they are always looking for a process that is a one size fits all approach and it never seems to fit just right."
good,"I have been gone from this company for over 10 years. I'm sure the culture, management and procedures have changed. I am still a very loyal shopper. And know many people that still work here"
good,"It was a great company to work for. Although management can use some work, overall it was a great experience that I had and still  will go back to if given the chance."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of printing morning sign batches, laying out the days task and constructing a schedule to efficiently complete each task in a timely manner. I learned to work hard and not expect much out of others. I also learned to stay focus on the tasks on hand regardless of those around me. The store I worked in showed a lot of favoritism. It was not uncommon for someone else to be acknowledged for your hard work. Although it was pleasant to work with the other employees, management tended to abuse their power and put down on many of their employees."
good,"Laid back job, but the management team is slow to respond. It is difficult to move up based purely on skill. However, the pay and benefits made the job a very plausible option at entry level."
good,"It's a fun place to work, plenty of space and opportunity to move up into management. Working there gave me a great work experience by way of customer interaction which I loved. The only downside is that it requires all of time."
good,If you are into technology then this is the place for you! You get first dibs into all of the new items coming out on shelves and the company gives good training to be able to help answer customer questions.
good,Had a great time working for geek squad as a intern. Coworkers were great working with and getting along with. Always getting sharpened every day far as experience and knowledge.
good,"Retail work is demanding but working for Best Buy made it fun. For the most part, employees are right there with you in the trenches and there's an air of camaraderie. You constantly learn new things not only about your own department but about everything else in the store. It is very physically intensive - at least in the HT department because of the size of the TVs you have to carry around - but I considered that a plus. I'm very grateful to my supervisor because he knew how to push me to do better each week without exhausting or discouraging me. This is a very good job to have if you like learning and you like working. Unfortunately, I didn't see any room to grow or progress within the company. There weren't even full-time positions available the two years I was there. The unstable hours was also a drag. You can't count on a steady income or having certain days available for errands and such. But I would still recommend Best Buy over other retail work opportunities."
good,Bien environnement de travail agréable personnes agréables a cotoyer.
good,"I love the work, the people, and the benefits. The managers are mostly fair. The one bad thing is I was hired under the pretense of a particular schedule, a year and a half later, management completely ignored this promise."
good,Good place to work if you are into technology driven products. Benefits are pretty good for a retail job. Best part is the employee discount. Advancement opportunities with the ability to move lateral y.
good,Great great great! Loved working here for the most part except that you had to try and sell people everything under the sun even if they didnt want it.
good,"A good place to work if you want to work retail. Holiday hours are no fun, but holiday pay helps outweigh the bad. Hard to promote unless you are on good terms with management."
good,A typical day at work is coming in ringing out customers and overcoming customer problems. Love the people I work with and the friendly work environment. Very competitive and you learn a lot every day.
good,Most efficient best buy i have worked at. The staff was friendly and welcoming when i first got there and made my experience there worth while in the end .
good,The company provides flexible hours for students. The company provides the ability to move up. It provides customer interactions and customer services.
good,was an okay job.if you know a lot about electronics and dont really want to do anything then its okay. 10 dollars an hour if you like people than its okay.
good,"It was okay. It is an alright job, employee discount is nice. Culture depends on who you work with. I would recommend depending on the manager. Other than that it is an okay job."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Good job for a young single, but with limited growth potential in their services division,  this is not a career/retirement company."
good,Great place to work if you enjoy technology. Company provides training for new employees and ongoing. Opportunities to meet new people and to demonstrate knowledge. Great incentive programs.
good,"It was a fun place to make friends and a little money. This is a great job for a high school junior or senior that has advanced past the movie theater, ice cream shop, and grocery store. Pay is about the same though."
good,People were great.  Management was mostly lazy passing off duties to supervisors when possible.  Pay was good.  Point of sale systems were well done easy to learn and use.
good,"I really like working at bestbuy, we have good breaks and lunch,we also have a ps4 to play in our free time!"
good,"Honestly, the job isn't hard at all and I had a fun time working there. It doesn't pay well but if you're just looking for a little extra money it's not a bad gig."
good,"the job is ok, the plain we sale to the customer have too much fine print information. the management are a bit pushy about sales. job culture are very good strong and positive."
good,"-really awful hours "
good,"Great Sales Training program prior to release of the new business model.  Not very competitive pay, and are now expected to be a true expert in every sku for the store with no incentive for mastery of sales and knowledge.  Most co-workers are great and fun to be around."
good,"Best Buy is at the tail end of a small renaissance. The culture in most stores is good, with the occasional poor manager. I will admit that the majority of General Managers that I have met have been rude and untrustworthy, however, the majority of assistants and supervisors have all been fantastic. The discount that employees get is very good, and the work-life balance is better than most places. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the many different employees that will inevitably pass through the doors while you are employed there. The worst part is saying goodbye to the good ones."
good,"Great Team, and good management. You will always find yourself learning a lot. Sometimes things can and will get a little hectic, especially around the holidays."
good,"fun environment"
good,very friendly and diverse. all ways have the latest and greatest technology in stock. i really enjoyed my time there as an employee. i would recommend this company
good,"Simple work day with varied tasks and plenty of customers to keep you on you're feet day by day and great staff to be able to communicate with, with the added exception of the break room having a home console for workers to let lose and lay back during breaks"
good,"•	Sold products, services and solutions to customers and helped solve their unique needs"
good,I was a full time student at the time that I was employed there. They definitely help with scheduling around your school schedule. They make the best schedules and do not judge because you are not available for certain days.
good,"Each day was filled with fun and activities to make our jobs more entertaining.  What I liked most about this job was the multiple different opportunities given to each individual to grow and move up in position.  I started off as a bench technician and within two years I moved up into a lead, audio/video technician and tv/monitor technician.  However, the least favorite part about this job was how each employees was being micro managed to meet a quota every day. There was a certain amount of electronics devices you had to fix each day and also contact each customer's, giving them an explanation or cost on the repairs and parts."
good,"Best Buy can be a good place to work for, as long as you do your job, be a team player and solve each issue with the up most customer service.  It can also be a bad place if you fail to do any of those things and it will reflect to your coworkers, the company really does care for its employees."
good,I liked Best Buy because you always had opportunities to grow and learn new things. I cross trained in different areas of the store and became very versatile.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Working at Geek Squad is hit or miss, it seems. Many places are fantastic to work and harbor great culture. The management at many of the stores is lacking and changes far too often. There is very little room for advancement, but the pay cap for each role is definitely fair. Working part time, you do receive a monthly/quarterly bonus based upon sales and productivity, as well as client satisfaction."
good,everyone feels like their on the same team. help is readily available to you and management stands up for their employees when appropriate. only real downside is the pay which is marginally above minimum wage for what is essentially engineer's work
good,"great starter job for the first time applicants. pay rate was fine and so was the team member discounts that were offered. great training and room for advancement,"
good,The job is fun and the tech you get to work with is just as fun. Customers whether good or bad help getting through the day so the better experience you make with them the better time you're going to have.
good,"More often than not it seems the management become friends with certain employees, giving them more benefits, more options for designing their ideal schedules, more options for advancement. While those of us who keep to ourselves and don't suck up aren't given many opportunities to advance or get very far within the company. I only experienced this at the Best Buy store that I started at. The one I am currently working for, I love the management team and everyone they hire/promote seem to be in it for the long-haul and they have everyone's best interests at heart. There are still some cases where certain people fraternize with one another and makes others feel isolated/unwanted. They also don't train new employess as well as they should."
good,Best buy is a great company to work for. Great management all around. I have learned a lot about being a better worker and being able to make tough decisions. Working with a variety of different ethnic backgrounds. A typical day day at work consists of being on my feet between 8-10 hours a day. Some days i have to be security for my store.
good,"I have been working at Best Buy part-time (over two-years)"
good,Great employees and management but the pay is not much to live off of for regular employees. Unloading trucks is a pain but with an organized back store room then its easy.
good,"really enjoyed my time at Best Buy Canada. I was lucky enough to take part in the grand opening of the barrie store which debuted a music department/ school. It was the best thing i could have done at the time, great benefits, good/ secure pay and i got to play guitar for a lot of it (which is not the case for the rest of the store) "
good,"Constant change. Great sense of team among employees. Continually looking to evolve who they are to the customer. Focused on customer, employees, and business."
good,"Usually the day begins with auditing of all the cell phone pricing. then we have a store meeting at the end of it we play a game of ball or what ever the manager see fit."
good,"I spent a long time with Best Buy and held many positions but the one position I held the most was in Inventory. My typical day consisted of getting shipments ready, unloading and loading trucks, inventory audits, receiving incoming shipments, stocking shelves, maintaining displays, price changes, and organizing the warehouse. During my time with Best Buy I learned a great deal about technology and customer service while I was working in the store. While I was apart of the Project Team I learned a wealth of knowledge about how to run network cabling, setting up networks, managed switches, and network troubleshooting. My managers for both the store and Project Team where amazing. They always cared about their employees as person and if there was anything the needed in and outside of work they were wiling to help you. The managers understood that whatever was happening in your personal life directly effected you at work so they took the time to get to know their employees and if you were going through a hard time they were sympathetic and willing to help you in any way possible. The workplace is like any other retail environment, but I was luckily enough to work with some amazing people and my coworkers were the reason that I worked for Best Buy for so many years. How ever great my coworkers were the job was not without it's challenges, the hardest part was how fast paced everything was and for some people that proved to be too much of a challenge. However that was the most enjoyable part for me, I would rather be busy all the time than not. It also meant that there was plenty"
good,Great place to work... they are great people that work there the enviorment is great alot of fun at work sometimes.. there have been alot of people who started off as line level and now supervisors and managers
good,Very competitive in terms of benefits. Employees that put in the work are compensated and rewarded. All employees are taught business metrics and encouraged to share best practices to help the team improve.
good,Great first job as a manager. Not enough input to truly manage department.  Great advancement opportunities for those who want to seek advancement. Hard to balance work life balance
good,Answer clients' calls to Geek Squad who are requesting assistance with their computer issues. Run Log Me in Rescue to diagnose problems with the computer to determine the best course of action in making repairs to the computer. I learned a lot about how the computers work. Sometimes there were problems in connecting to the clients' computers. I enjoyed doing this job as it gave me new skills.
good,"Huge opportunity for self development, really great atmosphere. Ability to learn from challenge and change. Interacting with people on a day to day basis to understand their needs and find solutions."
good,It was a fun part time job place to work. I enjoyed interactions between customers the most. That is what made my work days go by and be enjoyable. I think the best sales practices are customer awareness. What do they need> Are they simply browsing? What fits them and their needs.
good,"My experience working for Best Buy has been very lacking, though it is my favorite job to date.  The management team has been flexible with meeting my needs, but lacking in care and ""tack"".  I had to go on medical leave and management made me feel that I could pick up where I left off with-in the company.  Now that I have returned to work I find that my store's management team is very unwilling to help to protect themselves despite previous promises that are confidential.  However this has left a sour taste in my mouth, and makes me feel that Best Buy doesn't value it's employee's as much as the Renew Blue statements would have you believe.  I feel that I'm working just another job to make due with til I find something better.   "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,This was my first real job and it was perfect. They taught me the fundamentals to being a good hardworking employee. Hours were very flexible and reasonable and my fellow employees were a joy to work with.
good,"Recycling TVs is strenuous and potentially hazardous work. A lot of them are 20-40lbs, but others are 70-100lbs. All the dust and filament particles (mercury and other bad stuff) is really bad for respiratory health."
good,I had fun at best buy loved talking to customers but the management would never work whit the associate when it came to my hours
good,Working at this company was going well for me it was always busy but not chaotic. Management team was okay. I learned how to provide better service to customers and communicate better. Most enjoyable part was helping customers effectively and there was no hardest part.
good,"I have not been to a better work environment in the past few years, and have been treated with respect by all associates. I would do it again If I had."
good,"	Viewpoint member – plans, manages and builds in-store visuals, product displays and inventory control; employs staff morale boosting activities such as team cook-outs, company social events and integrated employee/public programs"
good,Overall Best Buy is a good place to work. Management makes or breaks your experience working for the company. If you have good managers you will enjoy working for the company and if you don't the you will probably dread going to work.
good,a typical day at work would require fast paced work ethic to be able to meet orders on time and load trucks full of skids for outgoing products.
good,"Best Buy is prided upon having fun while being the best. They make sure the work environment is great for both employees and customers everyone is involved and everything is about teamwork. They are very encouraging of people moving up and on. They are also big on promoting younger people and giving plenty of opportunities to succeed and move upwards in the company. Everybody comes in motivated, energetic and ready for the day. You get to work with thousands of different customers with each interaction different than the one before it."
good,"The management is good there, but I don't support the companies morals. I overall enjoyed working for this company just was offered a better opportunity."
good,"management had too be the most con of best buy. management only knew how to yell and put you down, never knew how to sit and talk nor give warnings or even good critcism"
good,Management are all usually pretty cool people. Simple tasks and expectations. Starting pay was good from when I started years ago.
good,Employee's were friendly and eager to help new associates/temps with questions. Building is a quiet environment with lots of PE equipment running around. Always be on your toes and pay attention to crossings.
good,There are a great number of wonderful people that work within the company at the store level as well as corporate level. The pay is fair however should be higher for the supervisor level.
good,Best buy helped me on communication on customers and also how to be a proper salesman. Learned a lot about Tv's and also soundbars. I'm a geek when it comes to electronics and technology
good,"I think that working at geeksquad has its own benefits.  You learn a lot about helping people, and about new technology.  You would go in for your scheduled shift, and you help customers, that have tech support, with their problems.  Again, coworkers are usually pretty great.  Best buy does a good job of hiring people."
good,I enjoyed my time here at best buy because it was fun to be around all the new electronics and see the excitement on someone's face when they get exactly what they are looking for.
good,"Best Buy is a fun place to work depending on your store. If you have a good store, you will have a fun time, but the culture of the store will also affect how you like it. If your store leaders don't respect the warehouse associates, then you're gonna hate being a warehouse associate."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,clean up around the ware house had fun with staff in seeing who can unload a truck faster. was a place where i enjoy my co-workers and supervisor always had our back and never knew what to expect coming to work.
good,"Somewhat difficult to advance at Best Buy, but not impossible. Management is very friendly but expects a lot from all employees, including part-timers. Expect to stay late around christmas time, but also get tons of hours. Not much drama compared to other workplaces, very friendly coworkers."
good,"I feel that it is am awesome place to start working when coming out of school, now saying that after a few years it becomes less of a lucrative job. The yearly raises dont give very much. The opportunity to move up and be difficult at times because there are not meny positions to move into and generally someone is being groomed into the postion before it is available for everyone else to get a chance at."
good,Recommend this company for an individual whom enjoys customer service. Fast Paced environment with room for advancement. Great culture and good people.
good,Best Buy was a good place to work. It's a good place to start a job for the first time.  Advancement can be difficult if you don't want to be management.
good,"If you are willing to put in the work, you can go as far and as fast as you want to go with this company.  They have developed a culture of promoting from within, and continually building a talent bench of quality men and women who drive results."
good,"Nothing overly poor to say about best buy, just kind of outgrew the job. The type of folks the job attracts makes a someone childish atmosphere present if there isn't strong leadership in the store."
good,Very hard working bunch of folks at Best Buy! Everybody for the most part got along and it was a great culture for working environments! We were a very busy place during the holidays and also regular work hours because we were one of the only stores in the area.
good,"clock in and make sure all employees were in place for the best experience."
good,Having worked here for 8 years I can tell you it's a fun place to work where things are constantly changing and if you love technology you will love this job!
good,Just started working there. So far it's pretty smooth. It's a face pace retail but laid back environment. Not a bad combo.
good,"A very good work place with a good mix of youth and experience.  Lots of tech, a fun environment.  Load/unload trucks is a very fulfilling experience.  Good atmosphere, room for advancement."
good,A day could start off slow if you have an opening shift depending on the day of the week. It tends to get busier throughout the day/night shifts. I was able to gain great customer service experience. Hardest part of the job was making sure you were always on top of your toes to help each other out and customers. It is such a fun job working with different people you get to help customers find what they need.
good,Best Buy has great bonuses and incentive.They provide plenty of training to make customer interactions smoother. The only bad part about the job is how crazy it gets on black Friday.
good,the company is doing well but many things are changing fast. Right now the only thing that is negative the the top down management structure that is in place. This causes a very stress full environment for general employees.
good,"Each day was repetitive, you learn customers are very rude. The people you work with you become close with. Hardest part- difficult customers. Most enjoyable meeting a handful of customers that brighten your day."
good,"Working at Best Buy was your standard cashier job. Daily task were making sure the check out lanes our clean, soda/candy was stocked, ringing people up, and selling Best Buy protection plans on electronic items. Working Black Friday was the most exciting day and was definitely an experience I will never forget."
good,I liked my coworkers and the job was pleasant. Most managers truly care about their employees. However there is just not much room for advancement unless someone above you leaves the company.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Great place to work, teach clients about new technology and empower them to make choices to improve and enhance their lives. Love technology and what it brings to our lives."
good,great work environment. A fun place to make life long friends. great discount! I really enjoyed taking on tough problems or customers and seeing them walk away satisfied.
good,"Best Buy is a fun place to work if you have few bills to pay and you still live with your parents. They do not schedule you very consistent hours unless you are full time and even then they do not want to schedule you a minute of overtime. It is very hard to move up in the ranks at best buy. they only look at sales numbers and do not take into account any actual leadership potential. I have a lot of leadership potential but I do not get a chance to show it very often as I have no authority to do so. I am fine with most of my coworkers, it is the leadership that I have a problem with. I work at the best buy in south land mall and a lot of our traffic is only passing through to go to the main part of the mall. Which means our store may look busy but the customers are not there for best buy. But we are still getting yelled at when are numbers are not up to par even though we have not had the right kind of customers in the store to sell things too. I did learn valuable selling skills as a result, and know how to pitch a product even if I do not know much about it."
good,"Developing associates to achieve and exceed sales goals. It has developed me to have great people skills and complete any difficult task put in front of me. I enjoy helping people, and finding ways to give them satisfaction with the correct products and solutions."
good,"At the wireless department it is great that you get to talk to different costumers with their different issues. However, you don't get any commission on your sales."
good,"typically at work, we contact customers on a daily basis. I've learned to understand and recommend customers solutions.  the management isn't to bad but sometimes they are bias towards employees.  Our co workers are easy to get along with and are very competitive.  the hardest part of the job is advancement.  it is very difficult to advance because management doesn't like to lose good employees for certain positions without having replacements. also another part is pay,  management isn't willing to work with you for pay raise.  the most enjoyable part of the job is being around technology.  you learn a lot about new technology."
good,"a lot of customers taking cheap computers to other countries, co workers are very knowledgeable and taught me everything i needed to know, management had high expectations, hardest part was attaching accessories, enjoyable part was reprinting receipts of successful transactions."
good,The work is periodically is some areas. Its not always consistent which could be a problem. Sales may not be driven to secure jobs to be done.
good,"Was a fun place to work when I started."
good,"I worked at a store that has since moved to a different location. The management was pretty awful -- I had one manager physically assault me in front of customers and watched in horror as another manager assaulted and then fired a friend of mine (he eventually got his job back). Employee theft was rampant, especially among the managers and loss prevention. Lots of inappropriate relations going on between managers and subordinates behind closed doors. We were pretty much taught in our monthly meetings to not care what customers thought of us because we didn't work on a commission. What mattered was the sales of service plans and how the store looked. And our customers retaliated -- they trashed our bathrooms, the parking lots, they complained and yelled at us every day, destroyed property inside the store. It was amusing at the time because I was young, but I would loathe that environment now. I did learn a lot about sales, appliances, store layouts and resets, and inventory and I made lifelong friends while employed there."
good,"Decent company to work for if you are starting out in the job market."
good,"The days at best buy are task based. I can say I learned the importance of proper organization and EFFECTIVE communication. My co workers were all fine for the most part with a few exceptions, one of them sadly enough being the team lead. My management on the other hand was sorely lacking in ways that would be unprofessional to get into. The hardest part of my job was only when things weren't communicated properly but other than that my job was enjoyable through and through."
good,Good workplace. Felt like home most of the time. Pretty laid back environment but hard to advance without tenure. Good benefits and fun atmosphere.
good,Great work from home position. Providing Technical support to geeksquad customers based off service level agreements. Open schedule.Great environment.
good,It was a very great place to work at while I was in school. They were flexible and supportive. The values and skills I learned there help me everyday in my current position.
good,My time with Best Buy has been one of the most important experiences in my life. While working there I have been able to grow as a professional while providing world class customer service to customers.
good,I honed my sales skills and communication skills here. Goal oriented hard work required. The work environment encouraged team building and cooperation.
good,"Best Buy has been an up and down place to work for me.  Some of the managers are wonderful - the manager who hired me is the best manager I've ever had.  Other supervisors and managers are rude and disrespectful, sometimes to employees and sometimes to customers.  They talk about how it used to be easy to move around in the company, but I ended up getting trapped in my position because they've been taking months and months to hire more people for my department.  Also, the store suffers from the same thing every retail place does - you end up with some irresponsible teenagers on the team.  However, I do feel appreciated and I'm compensated quite well.  Their full-time benefits are excellent for a retail store!"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Perfect for people who love and want to stay on top of technology. Outgoing and confident people do very well in sales. Coaching is provided to teach you about all the products and services but no coaching/training provided if you want to step up into leadership.
good,great job to have. very fast paste and well giving pay. Mostly busy during the holidays and the hardest part of the job is having customers but no productive to provide them with because your store is out of stock.
good,"Best Buy is always a good company to work with. Lots of things to learn, good training culture. Pay is not so high or good but good for the beginners."
good,I learned more interpersonal and communication skills being a part of the Best Buy community. I enjoyed the benefits and the work/life balance.
good,I learned how to have great customer service at all times. Fun co-workers who were very supportive. Seeing customers leave satisfied was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,A typical day at work would be just helping customers out when needing help and standing around for hours. I just learned how to make bill payments for customers an do credit card transactions. Their wasn't anything hard about the job. The most enjoyable thing about the job was the electronics i guess.
good,"I loved working here even though it had it's flaws, they promote internally, and I was promoted quickly. I loved the first 2 GM's and if you get a good General Manager you feel as if your work means something. Being a store manager I was working 60-80 hours a week so that did start to wear me down after 2 years when we were down 2 managers already, but I loved my position as Geek Squad Manager."
good,"Un ambiente excelente, jefes estrictos pero amigables, compañerismo excelente."
good,Great place to work for high school kids.  Lost of fun but not enough hours to pay bills.  The discounts are great though.  Unloading trucks and stocking the shelves is just about the most you do.  Sometimes you will be asked to sell items to customers if you have the knowledge to do so.
good,"great job fun people to work with but the pay was very low and the hours fluctuated heavenly, all and all a good job with great discounts"
good,"This job is really good for high school students. You can learn about retail, sales, inventory, and the food industry. Management would work with you and your schedule."
good,Good place to work. Great benefits. Fast pace retail environment. The only downside was that most of the work is for part-time employment. Only management was full-time.
good,"Management was fun, I got caught up on the latest and greatest technology, my coworkers were awesome.  It was fun enlightening most customers.  I didn't care to clean the break room but it was apparently part of the job description!"
good,Best Buy is a fun place to work. Management is less then desired but the other coworkers keep it fun and upbeat. Salary is poor especially because Best Buy does not give commission.
good,"Helping customer around with Laptops and Camera's was quite fun, because I enjoy working around technologies. Specially with camera's, I know a lot about camera and working at Best Buy helps me connects more with what I love. It was really great and different experience working with such nice and communicating surroundings. I think if you like what you do, you'll enjoy your job even more and would show more interest, that's why we should always go for what we love to do the most."
good,"Good workplace environment"
good,"Management was encouraging, and pushed to make work fun. Retail is not fun though, having to work with rude customers is not fun."
good,"Actively seek out customers to help them with their needs, ask questions and make recommendations based on customer needs, retrieve merchandise from location in store and ring up customers. Provide friendly and fast customer service. Maintain knowledge of computer products and promotions."
good,Learned a lot of new thing about electronics. Television repairs and installations. I also learned how to work the different systems.
good,"The work place is fun and productive, but I feel that the short amount of hours is what brings negativity among others. I've learned a lot about retail at this job. The management is alright. I have some cool co-workers. One of the most enjoyable parts of the job is being able to use discounts and getting paid when you work on a holiday."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,hard to move up in the company. rare raises. low pay. management is okay but a little pushy and expecting too much. co-workers are very nice and knowledgeable.
good,i just didnt get enough hours 10-13 a week is hard to get by staff was nice. the work day was laxed most days. management was professional. calling the  store for employees is bothersome
good,"Fun, corporate environment with many amenities. Highly intelligent, strong, strategic leadership.  Opportunity to learn about new products with frequent vendor visits and technology fairs on campus.  Good benefits."
good,"My day consisted of selling as much as possible."
good,"A general day would begin with me coming in at 6:00 am to open the warehouse. After signing in, I would rush to the back of the store to assess the jobs that were leftover from the previous employee that must be completed during my shift, and I would get my morning paperwork that automatically printed each day. After spending my first hour filing a small mound of paperwork associated with stock count variances, incoming and outgoing transfers, and finding End of Life product on the sales floor to send back to the manufacturer, our Order Management System would open. This means all online or ship to home orders made in store from the previous night at 9:00 pm through 7:00 am would come through all at once, and I am allotted 15 minutes to find all products and scan each UPC to ensure I have obtained the product for the customer. Now, these products were to either be sorted at customer service to await pick-up, or they would have to be packaged and ready to ship from the store. After all of that was taken care of, there would generally be 2 shipments of ~25-30 packages from UPS that would come in and a larger shipment of ~40 packages from FedEx that would arrive at our truck bay. These packages each had to be hand-keyed into our system to ensure proper stock counts, but this was generally a very long process as online orders will come through constantly in the mornings. After finishing receiving, I would begin the task of finishing any remaining shipments yet to either be received or to be put away from the previous associate's shift, and it was also usually this time that the"
good,"Typical day at work is talking to customers and narrow down the solution that best fits their lifestyle."
good,Great people and products.  A fun place to work.  Always changing and evolving to meet customer expectations.  Great core work philosophies.
good,"Very fun to work here, and very challenging. You are always on your feet and looking for the next customer to help anyway you can. I learned many sales techniques and was able to use this inform to be a top performer and Team leader in my department. Management got tense around the holidays, as expected. They were always teaching us and gave us many opportunities to move up in the company."
good,the ability to run your business your way within company guidelines of course.  ability to be innovative and continually grow.
good,"I enjoyed working for Best Buy, they were very good to me while I was in school, doing internships, and traveling.  They have an excellent tuition plan."
good,"Typical day at BestBuy would be assisting customers in finding the perfect technology solution based on their needs. I would come across multiple objections and problems customers had, but I would find ways to find alternatives and still have the customer leave happy with their purchase. I would also provide the latest knowledge on all our products ranging from routers, tablets, computers, PCs, and accessories."
good,"Overall I would say that working at BestBuy was a decent job, unfortunately without holding a supervisor position or higher, the pay is somewhat underwhelming."
good,"My days working at BestBuy were pretty fine. Whilst working there  i learned about product management, Using a cash register and handling cash. I also learned about product placement and most importantly how to treat customers and how to provide them with excellent service."
good,"All the benefits are great. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The hardest part about his job was meeting sale goals, with light customer traffic."
good,"During work days, it's always busy like any other regular work day in the company. I learned how to balance my time, hone my technical and people skill. For the management and the rest of the employees, every now and then you learn something new from them which is good. The hardest part of the job is when there are a large amount of work load and have to catch up with it for its turn time and of course getting the job with quality. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the company/branch meet the desired metrics, they give you extra incentive."
good,A great place to work with the latest technology at your fingertips. A ever changing market but always fun and interesting. Management are great and supportive. Training are fun and informative.
good,Working with customers to help them find a computer that they needed was always great. Teaching people how to use their new technology was also fun. Trying to push $300 dollars of tech support and damage protection on a family that has a $500 budget isn't so fun. The employees in my department were great to work with.
good,"A typical day at work consists of ringing of customers' purchases, keeping registers clean, answering basic customer questions. Stocking merchandise and food near front registers. I learned the register system very well and efficiently.  I know store return policies, how to sell credit cards and warranties on store product.  My co-workers and very energetic, fun, and helpful with providing product knowledge to my customers.  The hardest part of my job is when it gets very busy in the whole store, and at the registers, and I don't have extra back up cashiers. The most enjoyable part of my job is being productive, and meeting interesting and friendly people."
good,Dont look at having a long term career here. They will stick you in on position or move you around on same job code level positions. super hard to move up or get full time cause they company is trying to save money.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy was a very fun, exciting place to work.  The management was awesome.  The customers were fun to talk to.  There is a lot of room for advancement in this company."
good,"I enjoyed working with staff members, treat customers amazing. Fun dealing with clients and working on PC's.Never a boring day. You will be able to use your passion to learn and grow."
good,I worked at 2 best buy locations the first and most enjoyable in Northern Virginia. My job was primarily in the media department where i would set up displays for vendors on dates requested by them. As well and maintaining cleanliness and organization of the sections for customer ease in shopping. oh and mostly customers service.
good,"Best Buy management is very cut throat. I'm currently a sales lead, which is like just the tip into management, and if i were to go in any further i would be losing sleep over whether i would keep my job or not. corporate bosses are very adamant about sales, and if you're not hitting target they can be very overbearing on the subject. In the end, it bleeds down the chain of employees and morale takes a dive."
good,Great company to work for with great benefits.  Management is not all that great but improving on how to treat employees who actually show up to work and do their job.
good,good job to work for normal typical everyday job co-workers very nice lots of international customers you learn a lot there's so much to do all in one day but good job
good,Overall great place to hold steady job. Finding career path within company proves difficult if not willing to suck up to management. Management has hard time making tough decisions on policies. Wishy-Washy tactics. Fun co-workers on entry level.
good,"It is a fun work place. Very competitive. Management is good they are nice and want you to do well, working with co workers is less stressful and fun. The hardest part of the day is trying to meet certain goals they have for you."
good,Fun enviorment with supportive team . Not all about the numbers its more about connection and building great customer service .
good,Always competing to be the best and bring out the best in everyone. Management pushes too hard to sell services which can push away customers.
good,"Typical day in tales of superb customer service all day everyday."
good,"- Fast pace environment, helping customers with issues they have with their computers."
good,"Random hours, daily expectations for sales, and lot of people acting like your boss. Words of advice: Smile, nod and sell everything under the sun. Limited supervisor and management roles so moving up is scarce."
good,"Typical day at work would consist of laughter, long hours, and easy going. Co-workers were great people, like a family."
good,I enjoyed meeting new customer and learning about digital imagining. I liked helping the customer find the right device to satisfy their needs.
good,"A typical day is fast paced and changing.  Management for the most part is hands off but does a times give conflicting guidance.  The people are by far the most enjoyable part of the job.  Co-workers are good for the most part but as at any company there are those who are challenging to get along with.  The hardest part of the job is the inability to have a set, consistent day.  Work days vary in length by several hours."
good,"Best Buy gets a lot of bad reviews from past employees, however I really enjoyed my 12 years with the company before I was laid off. Best Buy gave me the freedom to work hard, get promoted, and lead a team. I enjoyed that everyday was different and you never knew what obstacles you had to overcome. I learned a lot from my mistakes and grew with the company."
good,I really enjoy working with people. I have learned how to diffuse a messy situation and do my best to help people. The management has been very frustrating and does not seem to keen to help when asked for help. The hardest part about customer service telling someone you are not able to help them further. What I enjoy most about customer service is when I am able to help someone and I can make them happy and satisfied with my service.
good,Working for Best Buy was a fairly good experience. Management was knowledgeable and able to train in all departments accordingly. Definately gained great industry experience working for this company especially being in the field of selling new technology.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Work both remotely and at a client's location, performing computer repairs, upgrades, installations, and consultations. When not in a client's home or business, Covert Agents work from home on a company-issued computer, providing remote technical support for clients via the Geek Squad technical support platform. -Supporting problem resolution with terminals, printers, access points, network equipment, scanners, and software."
good,"Some Managers DO NOT Care About Your Availability And Still Schedule You Outside Of Your Availability, Deny Your Day Off Requests, Then Write You Up If You Come In Late Or Don't Come In At All"
good,"overall Best Buy was a good company to work for, you stay up to date on technology, learn a lot more than you already knew, go on trainings where you get to meet people from all over the united state. just depends on the management crew they have and the environment you are working at."
good,"The work was a standard afair and a good introduction to the world of sales. I enjoy the overall experience, but sometimes the sales goals are unrealistic unfortauntely."
good,"We repair all brand of appliances.Samsung,LG.GE,Whirlpool,Frigidaire,Bosch,Viking .we learned new technology every day."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of taking care of any customer that came into my department and helping them find the right product they were looking for, keeping their budget in mind. "
good,"Its usually a lot going on at geek squad but mostly we just sit down and take parts of laptops and take the hard drives out and replace them."
good,The job it self was great; the lack of hours given sometimes isn't so great. My supervisor wouldn't give several employees including my self more than 12 hours a week.
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work, it allowed me to learn will having fun. Working for a retail technology company has been great. I am always up to date on the new technology as it hits the market. I work in the operations work of Best Buy and it has been great to learn how a large scale company conducts it self."
good,"This can be a great job, in fact most days I love it, but they money is just to low these days and the work schedule is difficult for you to have a life outside of the store ."
good,pretty cool place to work for but sometimes its hard for you to move upbecause favoritism comes into play a lot.Great company to work for if nothing else.
good,"Enhanced my customer service skills. Management was flexible and gave me time off or extra hours whenever I was in need. Great workplace culture, more like a family."
good,"Worked as a Portable Electronics Sales Associate for Best Buy at store 511 or almost 3 years. Enjoyed the role as I was introduced to the latest and greatest technologies in Digital Imaging, Car Audio, MP3 players, and more. Engaging and educating customers was a fun experience. The most difficult part of the job was finding a reason to stay in the position. While the tasks performed for the job were undeniably fun, I didn't feel like a valuable resource to the company. Despite my enthusiasm and others' Best Buys' model consists of mass amounts of part-time employees working 15-25 hours per week instead of small amounts of dedicated full-time employees working 32-40 hours per week. While the job was fun and interesting, I find Best Buy's business practices towards their employees rather mediocre. Most of their consultants are no more than glorified cashiers, but the few who aren't are treated equally despite their level of expertise and experience."
good,Having to make decisions while using my best judgment for the customers and for the business. They company is a great stepping stone
good,Was able to drive team to great numbers. Direct manager was fair and professional. I learned how to lead a team of over 15 people to sucess.
good,"It's a great place to get a temporary job, but be careful at the location I was at, it was easy to enjoy where you were and what you were doing and not want to leave. The pay is decent, the benefits are good (once you hit fulltime) and the people are generally really great."
good,"Allowed me to get started and build a reputation in field services"
good,"helping customers find products make orders answer phone calls ."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,A good place to work but not a lot of job security for leaders.  The company reorganizes annually.  You need to be an expert at change management.
good,"Best Buy INC. Is not a horrible place to be employed. Yes the company treats every employee like they are on sales commission and pushes workers to convince customers to buy things they do not need and will inevitably return them. There is a store culture but it is a fog that lingers in the air that everyone works here just because they have to. Some of my coworkers absolutely love this job. However, it just does not fit my pace. I want something that is more directed towards social life and giving people a good time or a luxury that they would not get else where. All in all Best Buy is just not right for me"
good,When I was at Best Buy it was a wonderful place to work and I learned a lot. The only problem was the constant push to meet a quota that nearly impossible to meet in today's internet shopping economy.
good,"It is pretty fun to work there, especially with the people you work with. They could really step up their management and actually giving us real training. Instead of us going home and doing our own research.  Hardest part of the job, is carrying tvs and other large products onto the customers car. Most enjoyable part of the job, is making big sales, but would be better if it was a commission based."
good,"At the location i was at, the management could of used a bit more training since they were somewhat new to the management position. Most of the management staff came from a small department store to  the largest foot traffic store in the area. Not knowing the products and the atmosphere definitely causes some issues"
good,"the work and co-workers were fun uplifting and encouraging, generally. some management was questionable but other then that the job was lot of fun"
good,Was a great opportunity to use my skills and knowledge of computers to help those in need of tech services and repairs. Built upon my skills and was able to grow as a technician.
good,"Best Buy is a good stating to point to learn the ins and outs of retail. They offer good pay and benefits to full time employees, such as stocks, health plans, store discounts, tuition reimbursement and other perks. The store life is similar to high school and can be fun at times. You can work hard to get into management positions. The best part is the experience you get working with people in a customer service oriented work place."
good,"I worked for a store, part-time (as it was the only position available, in the Computer and DI), and was paid only $9/hr.  I brought almost 10 years of customer service and sales experience, including management experience, an Associate Degree, and was working on a Bachelor.  I was insulted, to say the least.  "
good,"When you first come into Best Buy, the staff are very helpful in training you and preparing you for the sales floor. They teach you step by step on how to open up a conversation with a greeting. At some point they will make you go to a sales class that is required. It seems a bit too much and if you do fail the test. You will get written up for it. All and all it's a good job for part time and career wise. Downside the training does not stop, because there are new learning module each month on new products and it requires you to be informed about them."
good,fun place to work. Management can be a little too political.
good,"Most days there are many projects that can be worked on throughout the store, the more you take on the faster the day goes by. I've learned many interpersonal communications, how to analyze business metrics, and teach out the results taken by our business matrix. Most of my coworkers are very good with people, and generally have an optimism about the that translates thru their customer experiences. The hardest part of the job is picking up other's slack when they do not show up for their scheduled shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job is the feeling of satisfaction when you've made someone's day, by just doing your job."
good,"A typical day would consist of fellow employees trying to get through their day with constant fear of head hunting management looking for what everyone is doing wrong rather than what is being done right. With only one other competing service center within Best Buy's organization, the Chino service center where I worked at had the highest productivity and largest profits.  I believe it was the skill and knowledge behind those who worked there. As second in command of my team I found it very difficult to tend to the needs of my employees.  My military experience has given me the skill to tactfully protect my employees from a management team who's only interests was to reprimand for the littlest things. In doing so I had the respect and trust from my employees giving a higher moral than most teams on the tech floor.  Management tried their hardest to isolate each individual technician but creating solid barriers between each technician within each team and between the teams.  This only made it more impossible to assist those who work under me.  As a laptop diagnosing tech I had to assist the installing techs with issues that arise with each unit.  The most enjoyable part of my job was to share the knowledge I have with my co-workers.  I love to train and to be trained.  I am never satisfied just knowing the duties that are involved with my position.  I feel I can be more of an asset and increase productivity by knowing the duties of all departments involved to complete the job.  By knowing how other departments work, I can take the extra five seconds to organize outgoing paperwork"
good,The Employees and Management Team were great at all aspects of the store but Best Buy does not pay the national average to their employees especially Geek Squad in particular.
good,"Not for average retail employees. Fast paced, and consist change. Provide professional sales training classes and keep the environment fun and exciting. Very heavy workload and have to be self motivated for success."
good,"Handled cash and credit transactions  "
good,"overall fun place to work, great discount. depending on management they work with flexible schedules. good people for the most part. holiday season is a breeze not too much difficult work going on there."
good,Great place to work. Generally employee have great work ethics and take pride in their job. For the most part managers are good. not much space for growth but they prepare you for professional world.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,the most enjoyable part of my job was driving Raymond reach machine and walkie.
good,"Overall good place to work, good environment, overall all associates are good to work with."
good,Typical day wt work will either open or close the department. Help any customers with any questions or concerns and make sales all through out the day!
good,"Interesting work environment"
good,"Confused labor structures can makes the job challenging."
good,"I was a CSS, also known as a Customer Service Specialist. I worked as a cashier, but at Best Buy a cashier is more than someone that rings out customers. I was required to know about Geek Squad Protection and the different types that applied to different appliances. I was taught how to sell it and the benefits of buying it. I was also required to fill out Best Buy credit cards. One of the hardest things was trying to sell Geek Squad Protection (GSP), but every time I worked, it was another day to practice. By far my favorite thing about the job was my coworkers and the environment. I met a lot of great people and it was a great place to work."
good,I came to work logged right on the computer and started taking calls and making sales. I learned a lot about mobile devices and how to sale products over the phone. Management was ok never had no issues with management. My co-workers was like a second family to me. There was really no hard part to the job it was easy as saying your ABC's.
good,"Worked in car audio installation.  Relaxed work environment, management was always willing to work with schedule.  Learned a lot about cars, boats, motorcycles, inside and out.  Co-workers were very helpful, always someone with a little more knowledge willing to help close a sell.  Hardest part of the job were morning meetings, made the day really long."
good,"Not a bad job to have, can definitely grow as a person and as a salesman"
good,Went in a sold a lot of focus on credit cards. Keep you up to date on new products. Managment is a little grogy. It was a fun work enviroment.
good,"Depended upon who decided to stroll in.  Retail Management experience was very educational and gave me good ideas on how to handle different people in different situations.  Pay acceptable, but not for the ridiculous schedule that you are to work.  Very technical with knowledge to solve a litany of different issues."
good,"Responsible for teaching, coaching and recognizing sales team members behaviors appropriately to provide all customers with excellent shopping experiences and execute business group strategies, to drive exceptional business results.  Partners with the store leadership team to identify areas of business performance opportunities in support of business group plans. Reinforces behavioral expectations to support Retail Brand Standards and Merchandising along with reinforcing behavioral expectations of third party labor.  Enables a coaching environment for all sales associates to ensure that they are educated in every product we sell and is prepared to engage with our customers in an environment that makes them most comfortable while assessing and meeting them in a way that best serves their needs."
good,a day at best buy was nothing typical it was a very high pace busy enviorment with non-stop work. what i learned from Best Buy & Best Buy Mobile was my ability to sell to customers at a high level. the Management was a great part of work very helpful  and gava me a peace of mind on how to complete my day to day task.co-works was ok and the hardest part of the job where  the closing duties and the most enjoyable part was making BIG sales every day
good,Best Buy Canada is a great place to work. The people are nice and the managers are open to advice. The main downfall of the company is it's inability to train and promote people.
good,Its a nice place for people that are in high school to work. I have learned a lot working at this store. Its not a place to make a career.
good,"A typical day at Best Buy was to clock in and report to your department to meet your supervisor and get assign to your duties. I was responsible for customer service so I ring, exchanged and return products while handling the financing department. While Best Buy was my first job, I learned how to work with others as well as multitask."
good,"A typical work day consists of assisting customers, educating them about latest phone technology and making sales. I learned interacting with different kinds of people and also how to deal with escalations. The management is not as strong as it should be and some people take advantage of their positions. I am comfortable with all the co workers, working in a team environment always helps you learn more about different personalities. The hardest part is tough customers who do not want to listen to your side of the story but at the same time it challenges you to figure out the best solution in order make them content with service. Working with people is the best part where you get to meet and help a lot of people throughout the day, this helps in building relationships and creating owners of the products the company carries."
good,"I worked as a cashier/sales consultant in the front lanes of the store. There was a lot of training provided which I liked. After a week I had the registers down and was slowly given other responsibilities such as closing shift."
good,"Reviewed results from previous day and partnered with team to evaluate what worked, what didn't work and made adjustment to the day.   Determined if we were fully staffed for the day,  observed sales behaviors and checked on operational standards.  Reported daily to upper management and informed them what steps we were taking to stay aligned with company expectations.  Coordinated daily meetings with employee's to communicate focus area's and continued to motivate team to drive expected results.  The most difficult part of the job was keeping life balance for myself while focused on helping keep the life balance for employee's.   I thoroughly enjoyed hitting our daily goals and working closely with team in driving those results."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I had a great experience with Best Buy, there were many ups and down to the job.. I learned to become a better person to communicate and interact with. My favorite part was the interaction I had with customers on a day to day basis."
good,"Best Buy has a great culture and team atmosphere. Many store events, flexible schedule, school friendly, decent salary"
good,I love best buy always good to come in they have helpful employees
good,"Very busy, lots of responsibilities, and often challenging."
good,BestBuy is a good company to work for as an Auto Technician. The hours are consistent and they provide individuals with the right tools needed for training.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of interacting with many different people and understanding what they wanted and getting them that. I learned how upsell, sell bundles, and how to read the customer through asking information driven questions. Management did not work very close with staff. Co-workers were each others main support system. Hardest part of the job was working behind a register. The most enjoyable part was performing at a high pace and group selling."
good,"great company, great opprotunites and good experience."
good,"Worked primarily as a cashier during the holiday season.  Also worked in multimedia department."
good,"Excellent place to work as a student, you get to meet a lot of new people and interact with them."
good,when you get customers its fun whether they just want to  talk or purchase something.
good,"As an installer we complete jobs from a scheduled route in installing products sold from the store in many different types of enviroments as well as educate client's in how to use their new systems. Responsibilities include work tools, company vehicles, laptop and cell phone being used to complete our everyday jobs. We would also sell needed cables, mounts, and remotes to complete the job in a timely and accurate way possible. Sometimes we have difficult situations to find solutions to a job where a job is not sold correctly but in the end the customer is happy whether its a residential or commercial surrounding."
good,"When business is great,  work is great. When it isn't hard work is required. Managers are eager to assist. Great benefits. COnstant training."
good,"There was no typical work day here it was always something different working on computers. I learned alot at this job about working with computers, I had to take different lessons on what to do when working with computers and home intertanment systems. The management team was awsome if you had a problem they where always there for you and they were willing to help any way they could. My co-workers and me got along very well we worked well together and treated each other as family. The hardest part of the job was getting the computers fixed in a timely maner. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers and learning every thing that I did for working on computers."
good,Primary job responsibility was to establish customer relationships while meeting revenue goals.
good,"This is an INCREDIBLE place to work! The people are amazing, you are always learning about what is new, and you get to meet so many people from so many different backgrounds. I absolutely love working for this company. It's a big company though so sometimes you need to motivate yourself. Best Buy tries its hardest to make sure that we are motivated, but it's difficult. Customers will yell, insult, judge, and think that it's okay to insult your parents too. And being a girl within this business, it happens quite a bit. I've had co-workers shocked at what has been said to me and have asked me why I continue to work here. It's because I really do love it here!"
good,nice place to work for not stress the people there are nice. The doctors are easy to get along with. Hard working environment.
good,Long hours. Numbers driven. High energy. Overall good place to work.
good,Best Buy was a great pace to work. My position was eliminated company wide.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Great company to work for.  I developed fast with Best buy and have had great experiences.  They tought me how to be a leader rather than a manager.
good,I learned how to receive and ship products do inventory and work employee schedules
good,"Bestbuy is a very productive place to work, its also a veey fun place to work. The energy in bestbuy is awesome. Working at bestbuy you meet the most interesting people there while working and through your coworkers, ive met so many people from all over the world. My coworkers have became more then just coworkers but more like family they are your team and thats how we work. Management is also the same way u build a relationship with everyone very fair working enviorment. The best part of working for bestbuy is just assiting customers and getting to learn something new everyday."
good,Amazing company to work for. I love being a part of the best buy team and coming to work everyday. I know so much about my role.
good,A typical day at work would include a variety of duties in a positive environment. I learned how to adapt to change extremely fast and still produce world class results. The hardest part of the Job is when people leave. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the discount.
good,"Days at work can be challenging but is fun. "
good,"A typical day at work for me involves helping customers understand on how to use their technology as far as wireless printers, bluetooth speakers, their mobile devices and more. Best Buy has given me a great experience as far as advancing and learning more in depth on technology and molding me for my field. My co-workers were like my family which made the work play amazing. The hardest part of the job would be the constant change we, as a mobile employee, had to go through. From learning new plans and the depths of them, to constant promotions, new phone devices, the compatibility to the customer's life, the operating systems and working with various accounts and socials. But the hard part made it challenging in a good way and working with amazing co-workers it made it fun to learn and help each other understand it. After all you can't help a customer without fully understanding a product."
good,"A typical day if it was not a holiday was slow during the week and busy on weekends. The managers were nice, got along with co-workers, hardest part was making sales, most enjoyable part was looking at new technology."
good,"Management and co-workers are nice and get to know you outside of work, a lot became good friends. I learned great communication and selling skills from Best Buy. The hardest part of the job was keeping your numbers up, they really push you to sell and close every sale. I enjoyed company parties and meetings, getting to know my customers and selling cell phones."
good,"If you want a basic understanding of Computers or any type of tech, then selling them can defiantly help build that. I learned a great deal about computers, tablets, smart phones and televisions. The co-workers where almost all amazing people and hopefully friends for a long time after but the corporate set up isn't up to par. There has be a complete restructure almost every 8 months and management can't seem to keep up. Good starting sales job, but its not a career."
good,"Best Buy is a great company to work at, especially if you enjoy having peers around your own age. Management is always understanding and honest with how your performance is. The hardest part of working at Best Buy is, of course, the holiday hours. But it's retail, so you can't expect it not to be. As a sales support associate, I would receive truck shipments, organize them into their respective departments, and place the items on the sales floor. Whenever an online order would come in, I would have to go find the item and reserve it to be shipped to the customer. I would then pack the item and prepare it to be shipped. We have a whole team who does this, so the work goes rather quickly."
good,"As a teenager I will say this job is very fun and energetic. Best Buy has recently gone through a lot of changes that most are not proud of but as a company it is a fun work environment. You really get to try out the latest and greatest technology. I have learned so much at Best Buy. It has really shaped who I am today thanks to my connectivity leaders. I would love to advance in the company and as someone who's been a veteran for a year now I will say I am impressed. The management can sometimes be tough but maybe its out of care and concern. My co workers are some of the coolest people I have ever met. A typical day at work is full of surprises and excitement. Best Buy tends to get busy during certain hours and really dead during most. The hardest part of the job is not being able to have self expression through tattoos, or colorful socks or even better shoes for your feet."
good,"I worked as inventory part time the job at time was physically demanding but overall simple, but the best buy environment and co workers was awesome"
good,Good job for those who are tech savy. Get to work around what you love on a daily basis. Also if you are great with people and love helping out with all thier technical needs then this is the place for you. It is a fun atmosphere never a dull moment. Great coworkers and management is fair as well.
good,"Started in the computer department after helping to grand open the Ankeny store in 2009.  After 8 months I moved to Loss Prevention to get away from a supervisor that I just couldn't see eye to eye with.  Spent the next 3 years and 4 months standing in front of a CCTV day after day monitoring for theft while I was also busy directing customer traffic and checking receipts.  Never got more than a meets expectations on a performance evaluation but was never given any tips on how I could improve.  Job was a lot of stress and the only time management would take me seriously about talking out the problem was when I was ready to quit on the spot.  Position was eliminated due to corporate restructure in 2012.  Although I applied for many other positions, I got turned down for all of them.  I took it as a sign to get out of the retail game."
good,working their was ok though the management would always pick favorites always hard workers
good,"Not enough room for advancement, I have worked there two years and still haven't gotten offered a full time position. Easy fun place to work but needs more opportunities to advance."
good,Being able to help customers is priceless. Being a customer hero  is the best part of the although sometimes you can really get annoying customers with difficult questions.
good,"Dealing with every kind of costumers would be the most important duty, our goal is to have all of our costumers to be helped and meet their wants and needs."
good,Help customer then task. You can make good money there if you are able to move up in the ranks.  But once you do its very hard to have a life outside of work.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Spending most of my time dealing with customers trying to ensure their satisfaction with any and all products relating to my area. I also put together planograms and make sure all the displays are working.
good,"Develop a strong product knowledge and educate customers"
good,"They hired me seasonal. The general manager stated they didn't have a limit for how many seasonal people they can keep once the holidays were over. So, I experienced the main training and Register. I worked in Computing and Tablets which their management was very unorganized this holiday season. I ranked the top third performer for our area, yet they just let me go a couple of weeks ago due to ""over staff."""
good,"Best Buy has an excellent training program and takes the time to ensure their employee's are up to date and knowledgeable. "
good,"good place to work with good discount, great co workers, and learned sales and customer service skills"
good,"The typical day involves engaging customers to seek out their technological needs. Once you figure them out you carry them through the sales process of offering services and insurances all leading to the finalization of the sale. "
good,"A typical day as a CSA would be standing in or around the prescient,coexisting with Geek Squad. Taking returns, filling ut the proper paper work for certain items. Selling geek squad protection and credit cards, and checking certain items for damage. Hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers."
good,"Didn't dabble (much) in sales; the job was meticulous, detail-oriented, and overall, easy.  Rewarding."
good,"Co-workers were wonderful though management could get mired in politics, though that's the case with with every job."
good,"Good place to work, but really fast paced and you have to try to keep up with the amount of work load"
good,"Spent over 13 yrs with this company.  Learned alot, met many great thinkers and do'ers.  Half my life was with this company until downsizing.  Left due to GM"
good,"Loved the products, but corporate hassles get in the way of productivity."
good,"My experience at the Best Buy store I currently work has been an up and down roller-coaster. With the right personnel, the system is set up to function efficiently, but because of management, this is not always the case.Overall, the company is a great place to learn, receive training and to build a great networking base. The hardest part of the job is to adjust to the sudden changes that are constantly being made in regards to store and shift hours and dealing with the fact that you are forced to sometimes do things outside of the job requirement. The most enjoyable part of the job is to be able to assist people and to figure out various amounts of situations problems and mistakes to eventually result in great customer satisfaction. I love being able to help out a person in need and to have their backs whenever they need something."
good,Liked working for Best Buy. Some of the Managers and supervisors were completely incompetent.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of inventory controls, merchandising, customer greeting, down stocking, and cleaning.  All in all this was a great place to work with, we cared about the customers and it really showed. We had so many long lasting relationships that encouraged people to continuously come back. It never felt like it was about the sales but about the customers first and that's what made it such an authentic experience.  My co-workers were very supportive which made the job that much better. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with angry customers and the most enjoyable part was seeing a satisfied customer leave the store."
good,It is a fun place to work and a great place that works out well with school schedule. Only thing is that it's hard to grow/promoted within the company. Seems like there is a lot of favoritism.
good,"Decent wages starting comparably, management makes all the difference, co-workers are generally great to work with. Self-motivated training, lots of resources available."
good,good place to work. Understanding management and each person held accountable for what is needed.
good,I was just thrown in to the job. Not much training and alot of computer training.
good,There is noting wrong with technology whom is always changing. Sometimes poor management can get in the way of a team being productive. Many available moments to excel in the business if that was a desire.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Sell MP3 players and cell phones. Management cared more about making revenue than the people making the revenue.
good,"Talk all type of electronics with customers, in warehouse supervisor I would make sure all the different warehouse have their product out for customers to purchase and make sure the inventory team has all the product received"
good,"Good place, fun place. Always getting the latest updates on the newest products"
good,"-learn alot abt technology"
good,"Show up at work, speak to colleagues, print out reports and promotion and proceed to helping customers and selling services with all products. Co-workers are the best part of the job, the management can be hit or miss and interchangeable."
good,A day at work for me is a busy and productive day filled with new account openings and transfers. What I have learned working here is you always have to know and keep up with your promotions so you can give the customer the greatest price. The management team is all around the store and checks on your progress daily. The hardest part of the job is switching over lines it takes a while to do. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with new people everyday.
good,Great place to work as a young person looking to gain experience for management future. Lots of things to learn and people are free to share their ideas.
good,"Wonderful co-workers, acknowledgement of achievements, great team building meetings"
good,"One of Best Buy's motto's is to have fun while being the best. They truly encourage that in every store. They believe that when you are trained properly and provide a bit more relaxed and personal environment for customers that the results will be greater for both the employee and the customer. Our managers at Best Buy truly care about their employees not just the business they can bring them. We all work as a team at Best Buy and enjoy serving our customers and giving them our best efforts. The hardest part about working for Best Buy, I must admit is feeling like I lack much of my own life outside of work. They need you at work for the better part of the day. While working for best buy I have gained a bit more patients for others. I have also gained understanding for those who run into issues with products they purchase and how frustrating it can be."
good,great first job for someone looking for a job.. can turn to a career
good,I was a customer service rep and the day to day was pretty simple in nature. Your job is to assist customers in finding the right solution for  whatever the needs are. Now that you have found them a solution sell them some warranties and cables and/or other stuff they might want/need. You will learn a few selling techniques but nothing too impressive. My manager only cared about selling add-ons like warranties oh and the Best Buy credit card. These things make up a large profit for the company thus this is why you will get hounded about them when you shop. Selling is the main goal there. If you have a fun manager who is okay with your performace you will love it and they will bend over backwards for you. If you have problems selling the add-ons you will be okay but you might get pulled aside and lectured about selling techniques and so on and so forth. Nothing too demanding other than juggling multiple customers and trying to make sure you don't forget one. People don't like to be forgotten about.Discount was okay when I worked. Flexible hours but expect more work towards Black Friday and holiday season.
good,had a good time working there. have to work on your on. a lot of driving
good,"Best Buy has been my career and life for the past 3 years.  It has been a great experience both growing in a company and in life.  I started with Best Buy Mobile as a part time sales consultant and was quickly moved up to part time assistant manager within two months.  As the assistant manager I was there to run the floor and assist my manager with her tasks.  I learned everything from monitoring business metrics, inventory, cash management all the way to employee development.  I served as the assistant manager for 2 years before being promoted to General Manager.  The role of General Manager lets you step back, examine your business and then staff and develop the right people to get the job done."
good,The company is coming a long way but they need to really sift through all the junk they call district staff.
good,“I make sure to be ready and out the door so I can get to work at least 30 minutes before ‘start time.’ That way if there are delays such as traffic I’m still on time for any meetings or important tasks.
good,"I primarily worked in the warehouse where things were a little more laid back than out on the sales floor. My direct manager was really great, he was understanding and really tried to do what was best for you. Compared to the other managers in the store I couldn't say the same for all of them."
good,A great place to work - Creative thinkers provide innovative solutions for businesses around the world.
good,The atmosphere is pleasant to work in and enjoyed my co-workers
good,"Working at Best Buy is probably going to be the best retail job you can find. Although there have been issues with management playing favorites, it's not something that you're going to find better somewhere else. People have issues, but you don't let that alter your work ethic. Aside from that, working here is ridiculously fun. Your coworkers become your second family and it's all about ""having fun and being the best."" It's a fast-paced environment and the hardest part is probably dealing with upset customers, but you get that at any retail place. I would definitely recommend working here if you're looking for a retail job position where you want to feel comfortable with your environment."
good,I liked working for best buy. Meet allot of different people.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"A typical day at work is activating cellular phones and updating cellular phone planes and on our down time I make sure all signage is correct, prices are up to date and everything is stocked and out on the sales for. "
good,"When arriving at work my typical day starts with updating my knowledge around current performance month to date, quarter to date and year to date. After catching up I begin looking into every associates performance to look for strengths and opportunities to allow recognition and coaching. I solve customer issue if any, otherwise majority of my day consist mainly around coaching my associates around store and individual performance to increase customer experience and financial results. Being in this position has taught me the role and responsibilities of managing a team, and running a business. It has also aloud me to create a good behavior around customer experiences. I manage a team of 10-15 associates, mainly around Home Theater and Car Electronics Products. The hardest part of my job is finishing tasks on a busy business day. The most enjoyable part of my day is interacting with people, training people and educating people around things they don't know anything about."
good,"A typical would the daily chalk talk to learn who advance from or within the company, new growths, our target goals, or what is expected of us as a company. I learned how to love what you do and how far I can go. The hardest part of the job is learning how to love it."
good,"Loved working at Best Buy. the atmosphere is nice and the other workers were likable. Pay was very good, no benefits. My boss was awesome."
good,I believe Best Buy is a great place to work if you have a passion to help others find electronic or media needs. Best Buy is a place where superb customer service meets with top notch products. I have nothing bad to say about Best Buy and the employees who work there.
good,Fun environment great staff.  Made lots of connections.  Best buy has a great benefits program
good,"I've been here for 13 years, it has been a wonderful place to work for, work/life balance and fun eliments that are part of what this company a great place to be."
good,"Got some great experience working with electronics. Met some wonderful people. "
good,"The job pays very well, and there is a culture that promotes best practices. However, the leadership is very young and immature, which leads to role strain. If you don't take this job seriously, you will be just fine. If you wish to climb the corporate ladder and attend school full-time, you will be met with adversity."
good,"Customer is always right"
good,As a project team member i am gone much of the year and work over nights. Most weeks work 40 to 50 hours. Makes having a personal life a little hard.
good,"While I worked day,  leaders cared about people and the company"
good,"good experience and fun place to work, but no room for increase"
good,Entry level sales of technology products with addition of services and protection plans. 
good,"I got paid a lot of money..."
good,"Able to interact and hold conversations with many different individuals. Getting to know new people everyday on a more personals aspect by asking lifestyle questions. Management is very hands on because it is a very close knit work environment there are only about seven employees therefore we get to know each other on a very close level. Coworkers are very friendly, helpful and supportive. The only difficulty of the day is overcoming objections if customers when trying to assist in the decision of products. Most enjoyable parts of the day are closing duties making sure the store is back to its original state and writing the nightly email that consists of all the days events."
good,"you assist customers with any problem or when they are not able to understand certain things about technology."
good,This job has always provided a fun environment to go to when going to work. My co-workers have always been easy to get along with. The Management team has not always been the best. The training to move up within the company has stopped. It seems that now it easier to get a manager position if you are hired from outside the company
good,"As a product specialist my typical day starts by maintaining my department and then helping customers and offering them products that will help enrich their lives. Along with the core product I also have to see accessories and Best Buy Service plans that will help protect the product for years to come. The Management is great and create a informal environment. Seems more like you are working with friends. The schedule is different every week for part-timers, but you have the ability to switch shifts with your co-workers. The hardest part of the job is to convince difficult customers on a product and services. The most enjoyable part of work is when you make new friends and build great relationship with your co-workers and even customers. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I learned a lot here."
good,"Discount is good - pay is average and, well... its retail. Typical power hungry managers treating hourly employees like pawns"
good,"There are day it can be steady, but days that is can get really busy. The busy days are the most fun to work. You learn an extensive amount of traits/skills that were meant to help connect with the customers, but will they also help improve everyday life skills/habits. Management is the toughest to deal with, being that they a lot of times hassle you to, what feels like, bagger the customers and make sure they are doing ok. Most of the co-workers are great and we all get along well. We have fun doing our job. The most enjoyable part of the job really is helping out customers find their device and seeing them leave with confidence and understanding of what they purchased."
good,"A typical day at works is doing returns, helping customers fix issues, schedule appointments, and handling cash."
good,"Great management team, good employees, great business etiquette and extremely goal oriented company who thrives to provide the best customer service while attending to the customers needs for electronics and more."
good,The company went through a lot of changes and the results wasn't always the best. They lost a lot of upper management people because they couldn't appreciate the.
good,"The longest and most qualifying job I've held is with Best Buy. I have served 4+ years combined in phone sales and customer service, including Senior of Operations. I've worked in two locations during my 5 year career with the company. Currently, I am selling in the home theater, appliances, gaming, car audio, and digital imaging departments. I enjoy interacting with my customers and finding the perfect solution for their individualized needs. Although it can be difficult to keep up with the ever changing technology around us, I enjoy the challenge of understanding how it works and providing an impactful experience for my customers."
good,This job has been very fun to work at. Time flies because its upbeat and great staff working with you
good,"Working with Best Buy was fun and fast paced. I learned about custom home theater installations and proper techniques on how to do them. The management was very laid back for a retail organization. The co-workers I had were quite laid back as well. They almost seemed to not mind if they didn't make a sale. The retail hours of the job were rough, as was getting used to no being a manager. The most enjoyable part of this job was the satisfaction I earned when finishing an install."
good,Best Buy was definatly one of my favorite places to work. Everyday is full of laughter and games while being your best. The staff becomes your best friends.
good,This is a great place to work! Fast paced and fun. Management is great.
good,"A well diverse work place with a rich culture from around the world. Productive and fun to play with the latest technology on a daily bases. Learning new things everyday and meeting new people everyday , that's the most enjoyable part of my job. The hardest part is scheduling issues management not been very consistency with work hours makes it difficult to plan for outside of job events or family."
good,"Best Buy is going through enormous change. However, it's a great place to work filled with many talented people."
good,"My typical work day would anywhere from 4-6 am in the moring on the off season. I would work a minimum of 10 hours if not more. Durning my 14 years with the company I learned a great deal about customer interfacing, sales, management techniques, employee motivations, team building, inventory, and shrink control. I reported to a district staff sent out recap emails of prgresses, shortages, worked with the DC to find product and worked with other stores to keep our district up to speed on any iteams stolen, when and where. The hardest part of the job was my drive to and from work, I worked 50 miles from my store. Sitting in traffic to and from the job was the worst part. I enjoyed training my team in the job and becoming efficient and the best in what we did. I enjoyed helping people realize what it was they were looking for from the postion they were in, and where they wanted to go."
good,"While the job itself was not bad, the store I worked at was hard to advance in unless you joined in with the manager's poker games every weekend."
good,people are real nice fun to work with but management is to busy to really teach you anything.
good,Assisted customers in find the right kind of computer for their needs. Explain to customers the desktop and notebook computers and software/hardware that work with them. Sometimes had to work up until midnight stocking shelves. Worked part time in the evenings after my full time job.
good,Great customer base and providing of knowledge of product and services to customers but management treats employees poorly
good,Attend work to complete returns and exchanges and help customers receive great customer satisfaction.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Typical day of work consists of down-stocking product, ""clean and bright"" (i.e. dusting, cleaning tv screens, tablets and other displays, etc...), putting new product on display, some planogramming, pricing and signing, all while making sure your priority is one customers. New compensation/bonus system is pretty sweet and all you have to do is do your job!"
good,After working for this company for a few years it's fair to say that Best Buy is a good company to work for. The only real gripe i have is with the ability to advance within the company and get the hrs and benefits that an adult needs to survive on their own with part time pay and no health care benefits.
good,"Great Company while it lasted, was fast fun environment, great freinds, and great technology, great discounts and some great benefits. Enjoyed working at best buy for 20yrs. Did had its ups and downs but always overcome the challenges and obstacles."
good,"I joined best buy in 2006, and worked with them non stop until May of this year. It was a good place to work for most of the time, and had the added benefit of being pretty flexible with shifts. My specific location also had a great staff and we became very friendly, which I felt was conducive to a healthy work environment."
good,fun place all around. store was clean and big. i would go back and work there again.
good,"they don't pay too much, no opportunities for advancement, but is a fun place to work for a season."
good,to get anywhere you have to be willing to cut your friends. It is sad really.
good,Organized work area to quickly reference and close sales based on individuals needs. I learned how to effectively communicate with others to help find what they were looking for. Hardest part of the job was working with customers who had no idea what they were looking for. The most enjoyable part was knowing I helped a customer choose something that fit their lifestyle.
good,Good place to receive basic training at if your interested in retail and knowledge about computers.
good,typical day is helping customers with all questions in your home department and also other departments. what i can take away from here is trainging is key in developing your skills. Management when i was there was very structured and very apporachable. co-workers are usually very friendly and helpful. hardest part of the job is taking breaks i know if you are short staffed its hard to get someone to cover you so you can go to break. best part about working for best buy is knowing all the lastest and greatest of whats comming out and know the true prices of most items
good,I like the job and the type of work but the hours make it hard to have a personal life and balance work and home. Better for those without children unless you work first shift. The job is easy and pays good. If you work hard there are opportunities for advancement. They train you if you want to move to another position in the company. Full time work.
good,I worked there during the holiday season and it was fun. The employee discount is AMAZING!
good,I feel that the pay and benefits for part time employees could be much better the only benefit the part time employees receive is the employee discount and it would be nice if the company offered more to there part time staff members. But on the plus side of the job is that the company for the most part works as a team. Work and life balance is very good. The typical day as a truck associate is you unload the merchandise and put in each of the departments around the store. The hardest part of the day is when the associates in each of the departments that your putting merchandise away in don't help you when there is down time within the store.
good,"Working for Best Buy involves team cooperation and reliance between management and co-workers for daily updates on departmental goals and numbers. Department activities included cellular activations, database entry, follow up requests, troubleshooting, and sales. The most enjoyable part of the job is exposure to new and innovative technologies, prior to street release date. The only difficulty in this position is educating each and every customer on these wonderful products."
good,Best Buy was a fun job. Management was very good at helping out with any issues. Co-workers really cared about help customers. I learned everything i know about retail and serving customers from Best Buy
good,I am going to keep this short. Geek Squad was great but rarely allowed me to use any of my talents repairing hardware and never did I get to use my programming skills.
good,Fun place to work. Always encouraging you to excel and learn new things within the store. Management was very flexible and willing to work with your schedule (such as school).
good,BestBuy was a great company to work for and had a lot of fun with my Co -workers. Loved assisting clients with Technical needs.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,A typical day at work was constant security checks on employes and customers.
good,employees were okay but management wasn't great when it came to speaking to employees on the sales floor in front of customers.
good,"Best Buy knows how to enjoy work. High energy work environment, but pay is weak and results are needed."
good,Network & Systems Security; Business Impact Analysis; Regulatory Adherence; Data integrity / Recovery; Contingency Planning; Research & Development; Risk Assessment; Cost Benefits Analysis
good,it takes time to get a steady work flow down and dealing with management is extremely tough but the perks are worth it.
good,But following Black Friday the Job didn't like me.. for a Hoodie in the break room.. Long story
good,"Best buy is not a career opportunity, but it is a job and it has great discounts."
good,"I've worked for Best Buy for almost five years and I can say that even with the big changes the company is going thru as we speak, it is still a good place and company to work for. I have felt that job security is always there, even with everything that has happened. My day consists of me working with my team of sales associates to help them hit our department goals, help all of our customers, and make sure everyone is having a good day."
good,"Most days consisted of having fun with customers and employees while striving to be the best. I Learned to have exceptional people skills while dealing with Manager On Duty issues, coaching and training co workers, and for the most part doing my managers job when she was not present. My co workers throughout the store were very friendly and we almost were like a family in some sense. I loved being able to sit down with customers and explain values and get to touch base with them on a personal level."
good,"Pretty tedious work other than dealing with customers with different needs. I learned a lot about customer service. management was horrible about changing schedules, providing needs, and recognizing achievements. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unhappy customers that you can't do anything for them. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you helped out a customer who really appreciates what you did for them."
good,"This company definitely taught me how to open up and be a more social seller, I learned some great traits from this company. everyone is pretty knowledgeable about product and management never seemed immature or irresponsible."
good,"The store is run well on priciple, except Management of indivual locations are allowed too much management leeway. Following only general corporate rules under individual management allows certain areas to become out of proper control. Employees are treated as though they are machines without flexibility which much exist store to store."
good,"A lot of unbusy days make the day long and boring, learned how to stay busy even when it seem to not be anything to do in the store. Management in my opinion is not very good good management should know more about what is in the store than the employees they hire. Co-workers work hard everyday and are very informative. Job to me is easy I know where everything is located in my department and in some other departments as well. The most enjoyable part of the job to me is to hear the customers say that I am really good if not the best at my job."
good,"Best Buy is a very good environment to work at, I learned a lot about people NEVER GET TOO COMFORTABLE WITH A CO WORKER. You deal with all types of customers, I tell you. The pay was ok, was working at least 30hrs per week. If I was ever given the opportunity to work there again, I would"
good,I repaired every brand of computers there are and learned several unique trends for each brand. the environment was great but the problem lies with over management. Every person has several bosses to answer to and impress and it makes it difficult when the management would not discuss issues amongst each other. The best part of the job was the diverse areas of expertise by the fellow employees that they were always willing to share.
good,Great place to work with productive and motivated employees.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Best Buy. I started there part time, in college and went through just about all the store level stages. It was fun and demanding, especially for the management team. I have worked for a few different national corporations, all of which were Fortune 500 at the time, and I have never seen a company as dedicated to training their sales force as rigorously as they were. The drawback was the restructuring. Best Buy is not afraid to change. Sometimes, it seems, both on a whim and a dime. In nearly 12 years with the company, the management structure was changed 5 times, often reducing spots and combining responsibilities. Ending my career there as a Sales Manager (CSM), There was a lot on my plate that really strained my Work/Life balance. In the end, I can say that I had a lot of fun & and a lot of frustration with Best Buy. I learned how to manage people, and myself. I learned how a business can succeed when things are going it's way, and how it can struggle when things aren't. I enjoyed competent, enthusiastic, and driven co-workers, in a hectic retail environment and overall, that was the best part of the job. The heart of Best Buy is it's people, and there are some good ones there."
good,I enjoyed being involved in the customers experience. Customer satisfaction was the priority.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The eight years of employment with this company has been filled with knowledge, experience,challenge,change and growth. This enabled my growth not only as a leader but as a peer, and as an individual. Best Buy has given me the opportunity to create relationships that not only served me as an individual,but created a work enviroment that was enjoyable for the employee's as well as the customers that we serve. The typical day would consist of continued training of staff as well as myself in some cases, constant monitor of sales and behavior results, staff and customer issue's,schedule accomodation for business needs, as well as scheduling for future trends, payroll, time and attendance, Human Resource tasks, audits, merchandising,employee involvement tasks and preperation, meeting attendance, as well as prepartion, staffing needs, interviewing, recruiting when needed"
good,Helped customers in the computer department to purchase equipment with system requirements based on their need.
good,"A typical day at work, I explained products and sold services to go with products. It actually enjoyed the job because it consisted of meeting and helping new people."
good,"Typically, each day begins with checking email for updates that may affect the outcome of the upcoming day and its events. Following, I meet with my trainee and discuss the work orders scheduled to complete during the day and we discuss inventory on hand to complete each work order. We then call each of our clients to discuss the work to be performed, the technology being used, and give each client a more precise arrival window. Upon arrival at each clients house we performed a ""pre-walk"" assessing the situation before bringing in product and tools. We complete all work on the work order, address concerns of the client, and make recommendations (or upsell) of products or services in addition that may benefit our clients."
good,"Great environment with a different crowd of customers, its a great challenge to see what kind of sales associate you are."
good,"A great field to work in especially if knowledgeable in the product. Its a great start if you wanna progress to a more difficult level of work, this field prepares you."
good,The Best buy experience was very fun. I really enjoyed it. Other then the fact that at some points i felt over worked
good,"Working for Geek Squad within Best Buy has it ups and downs. From the repair stand point, GS provided a constant challenge by being introduced to the newest issues and threats occurring to current computers. From the down side, Best Buy is all about politics when it comes to getting promoted and if you do not know someone, do not plan to move up. Over the years Best Buy has grown to no longer care what is best for the customer but to push its employees to be commission style driven with a low hourly wage. No matter how much money you make them, or how good of a job you do because at the end of the day it is not enough and every manager will make that evident."
good,"Good place to work, fair pay and great benefits. Even though sales are not commission base, managers hound you like they are."
good,"I worked for Geek Squad for 5 years. When I started I was expecting to learn how to repair and maintain different IT systems. Instead I found out that GS (the abbreviation employees call Geek Squad by) is often very low on actual computer repair talent. But they make up for it with the dutifully enforced mantra of ""if I do not know, I will find out."" This may actually be a better way to approach consumer electronics service, as the industry has changed so rapidly in such a short time that anyone with extensive training on PC repair in 2001 would find themselves completely befuddled by the state of the world in 2011."
good,it was a great first place to work. I learned a lot of work ethics and how to work as team.
good,"The time I spent with Best Buy was mostly positive, but I noticed some changes that I didnt quite agree with toward the end of my time there. However, still a great experiance and I would not have traded it for anything."
good,Ils devraient permettre le salaire à la commission $$$$
good,"It was a fun job , management needs to show more caring about employees .. only thing they care about is production and how many credit apps you get ..."
good,"Best Buy is a company that values team work, diversity, and technological solutions and the distribution and sales of said technology. As long as you're able to work in a fast paced environment you will do well here. "
good,"It is a fantastic place to work with great and supportive supervisors and managers. I made lots of friends and my co-workers that I was shadowing in the beginning were very, very helpful. However, whenever the holiday season is over, you get significantly less hours. For example, I was asking for around 30-40 hours a week and got around 32 a week which was absolutely great until a week ago. Last week, I only worked 6 hours and this week I don't work at all. Next week I only work 8 hours. It is quite clear, they meet their bottom line with much fewer employees now that the holiday season is over. Because of the significantly less work hours, I am now looking for a new job."
good,Ok to make good money during their peak time of year. Somewhat disorganized on the floor. But overall during peak season its a good place to make good money.
good,"Dont have unrealistic expectations and it can be a good place to work. It's not a perfect place, but as I have family in multiple retail chains, I found my experience with Best Buy to be the best. Again, its not perfect, and the strains to compete with online shopping will be felt on the sales floor. Still, how they have treated employees in the past 4 to 5 years is far and away better than their competition. If you make it a choice to make sales management a career choice, they have a structured and mentored path to help you do it. Its not something I recommend as a career choice, but they'll make it happen if you do want it."
good,"Bestbuy prides itself in being a non commission sales base but still pushes employees to up sell customers, get credit card applications, and other subscriptions."
good,I love working here and I had a really great experience working for this company. The only short coming was the transition of hours after the holiday but other than that I loved it
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Enjoyed working there, the culture is fun, friendly, and fast paced."
good,"A bit pushy for sales results, but overall a good company to work for, so long as your management team is supportive and human. Employee discount is worth it."
good,"I worked during the Christmas season, so it was a fast-moving experience that I was quickly able to move with, but it got tiring towards the end. I would not want to be hired during the Christmas time again, and would have rather joined at a more relaxed time of the year in order to properly get used to all the tasks that were required of me as a member of the floor."
good,"It’s a great atmosphere, people you work with are knowledgeable and friendly. Hours are typical for retail- can get stressful during holidays. Find someone in management that cares about seeing others succeed if you want to move up"
good,"Don't trust their seasonal option to stay on, even if you meet your requirements. Also, the store is ungodly slow sometimes. The coworkers are great!!"
good,"This job requires a lot of learning and people skills. The most enjoyable part of this job is the fat discount they give on tech accessories.  The people that work here are pretty cool, most are very knowledgable about the products and overall tech."
good,"Working for best buy was a very good experience overall. My co workers were very nice and helpful, management always made sure each employee was doing okay both physically and mentally. The only draw back is that after standing around doing almost nothing all day the job just kinda loses its touch, it became boring and just no longer what i felt when i first joined the team."
good,Overall the work environment was great. If you love communicating with people then I would highly recommend this place as there won't be a single day where you won't talk to a customer. Many great co-workers and the employee discount was a big bonus.
good,"Worked as seasonal employee, having originally applied for Home Theater, though permanent employment became tricky without communication and manager confusion took place."
good,Good and flexible schedule. Decent management that will work with you on your schedule. Hard to obtain full time positions but the hours are usually there if you work hard
good,"Only bad thing is that managers can be very fake and lie to you right in front of your face. Unless you are a favorite then you can get promoted. Also if a plan does not work for the store, the managers will tell you to break SOP."
good,Training in new technology. Fast paced workplace with fun to be had! Sales driven atmosphere aimed at helping the customer. Black Friday is actually more fun than you would think!
good,Fun coworkers and customers. Training was in depth nd fun as well. Management was helpful as long as you were proactive about progression. If know individuals ask for help finding ways to advance they will fall to the wayside.
good,"t was cool job i enjoyed the employees and management, I made a lot of new connections and got to learn a lot about  the people and technology that came into the store"
good,Diversity and the new innovations in technology were great! Learning about all the new gadgets were not only knowledgeable but fun! Management not so great.
good,"It's a fun place to work at, if you don't know anything about selling to the products sold there you will be given lots of training and videos to bring you up to speed."
good,"Most of the things you learn will come from your customers. Every sale-situation is a learning experience, you’ll learn something new everyday to implement in your Best Buy career."
good,Though it was years ago - I did enjoy working along with such caring/funny people. It helped my re-introduction into the warehouse environment. I valued my time there greatly.
good,Its like everyone there is a family. I get along with all of my co-workers and everyone is knowledgeable about technology and what department that they're in.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"But the only bad thing about Best Buy if you’re seasonal is second guessing whether you’ll ever get scheduled "
good,"Push the credit card, push the insurance, push this and that. Ultimately the co-workers were the best thing about the job. I didn't really feel like I was doing anything great with computers as I had hoped. I was 17 though and needed a job so I took what I could get."
good,"processed phone calls whether it was upgrades to returns, and or setting up services for the products customers purchased. Also sold protection plans and or connected the customer to the actual store location when and if needed to further complete their best buy buying experience."
good,It's a great company to learn skills in customer service. if you get with the right click you can move up. you have to likable. have to work with lots of kids.
good,"Mainly provide advice on devices like laptops and related devices to customers, so there is a great chance for learning customer service through interactions."
good,"Most days are quite simple and repetitive, with a fairly long training process I understood most of what I was required to do and in particular what I was responsible for in my team. Co-workers are great and competitive which keeps you on your toes, employee discount are an even bigger plus. Overall great tech store to work for and much can be learned from it."
good,The company functions the same from a customer stand point to becoming an employee great work culture. They focus heavily on customer engagement and employee incentives.
good,"Depending on how business is, it can either be extremely entertaining or it can drag on. I learned to manage time more efficiently and also learned a lot of the systems that help Best Buy do their business."
good,Needs new and experienced  management in almost every department! The location promises and offers you every single thing that basically you will never see.
good,"Most days are the same as others. You get your assignment's, pick the units needed for the orders, then clean up and go home. Safety is very important and one of the main focus's."
good,"The teamwork there was amazing. Everyone came together to help each other learn and get through the workday. Busy times were a little stressful, however, the atmosphere of being around electronics made it easier."
good,It was a fun place to work and co-workers are awesome.  The management that was there when I worked did not let me advance.  I never worked more than part-time even though I applied for full-time 3 times.
good,Best buy is a great job for developing people skills and becoming a problem solver.  You create customer solution packages. Giving the consumer what they need not what they ask for.
good,"Not really much to say about them, the company is good, the pay could be better across the board. I liked the position and the job description. I would recommend this company to my friends and family."
good,Best Buy was a ton of fun to work for and in. Friendships were made and the managers are often easy going as well. Sucks during the holidays when you’re working 12 hour shifts day after day though.
good,"Working at Best Buy was an enjoyable experience, but probably not one I'd consider for future employment opportunities. On a typical day, I would have basic cashiering duties, promoting protection plans and credit cards available there. The management there was rather difficult at times and did not seem to understand its employees very well."
good,"My only issue with them is that you are a ""Trainee"" for a very long time. like 3 months. While you are a Trainee, you won't get many hours."
good,Best Buy provides tons of learning and development opportunities to employees. Our campus is fun and energizing and our leaders promote growth. You're encouraged to be your best and can stretch across multiple disciplines to learn.
good,"Great place to work as a first job, family oriented, events put on for employee bonding, provide food and treats on busy shopping days like boxing day"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Good place to learn about sales, customer service and products. Great benefits in terms of employee discounts. Overall pretty relaxed as long as you did what you were supposed to do. One thing which I did not like is pressure to sell extra that sometimes was obvious the customer didnt need."
good,"Pros:"
good,Management and employees made this work experience one of the better jobs in my work experience. The staff was about handling business but also having a good time while getting the job.
good,A typical day at work consists of coming in at beginning of your shift and then signing into a point of sale system. Management really emphasizes the importance of credit card applications over anything. Workplace culture is competitive towards application but towards revenue not so much when all you get is a mention at the end of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers who have been unsuccessful in finding what they were looking for and if not available ordering the product to their house to put them at ease.
good,"Was a great work space until it wasn't. It was a great job while in school, hard to advance to management level and remain sane. Lots of benefits & they do try their best. There is an e-voice commitee which is lead by employees to help voice the opinoons and concerns of other employees."
good,I started as an occasional seasonal Mobile associate and now currently I am working full-time as a project team specialist it’s a lot of traveling however when it comes to pay it’s amazing because you get per DM guaranteed overtime and a higher paygrade
good,"Sales often depend on how many customers you get. During slow seasons it can be hard to meet goals, but my managers always tried to help their employees meet team and individual goals."
good,"Being a GeekSquad agent was basically amazing in the sense of work life balance and challenge, up until Apple was involved. Now I can't recommend it. The culture of the Geeks are dying, and it's starting to show."
good,I loved working for kenosha and gurnee Best Buy  it was a fun time and a fun experience  I would go back if they would let me or I changed my mind to return
good,"great coworkers, meh management over the course of a year i've learned that the most important thing there is numbers. if you have good numbers there you are a success if not then your dead in the water."
good,I have worked several holiday contracts with Best Buy at different locations and my overall experience has been positive. Best Buy is a fairly enjoyable place to work since they sell interesting products and all the people I have met there are really nice.
good,The work place has flexible schedules and great discounts. Most co-workers are great to work with and if you like tech you can definitely learn many new thing through their e-learnings.
good,In conclusion Best Buy does offer a paternity my experience with Best Buy was fair but I was say to anyone to be prepared to do more than your job description
good,"you deal with a lot of customers who try to return things after the return policy has ended, and answer a lot of phone calls. Management is more or less on top of backing you up but didnt always come up right away. I learned a lot about the products that were sold. Hardest part was dealing with customers that didnt want to take no for an answer. Most enjoyable part of working here is learning about the products."
good,"I learnt a lot being a Geek Squad agent. The pay grading scale was horrible."
good,if you like technology this is a good job for you. they train you on all of the new stuff coming out. i worked in the warehouse. it is a different environment then the sales for. most days are relaxed unless it is a truck day.
good,"Management was okay. Warehouse job was pretty easy, don't have to deal with customers. Could be a headache trying to find small items but wasnt too bad."
good,The job was great for gaining experience and improving but the opportunities for growth are limited and may take a very long time to move up. Overall it was a good and welcome experience.
good,"In the 2 1/2 years I worked there, top store management changed 3 times.  It was a very laid back environment, which was nice, but management seemed to have issues getting rid of problem employees.  There's at least one still there that should have been gone a long time ago, lies to customers and management knows it, but they keep him because of the number of credit cards he signs people up for and sales of protection plans, that would be where the lying comes in.  i would consider going back if that one person was gone."
good,"People are great as in most workplaces, the work isn't overly complicated or difficult. As much as the company doesn't run off commission, they still do push you to sell as if you were being paid commission. Other than that a pretty good place to work, competitive wages, great atmosphere, management is understanding. Would recommend."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Everything in this company was good to work for to bad i broke my leg and was not able to go back being that i had to stand for a long period of time.
good,Working there was a great experience and gave me a lot of things I can take away from it. I loved the people I worked with just did not see much room for advancement.
good,Best buy has a good work culture. The people were fun and the job was not too bad. I had plenty to learn and do. I never got stuck with the same thing over and over again.
good,"Overall good place depending on management."
good,"Realmente no es tan malo para tu primer empleo, te dan buena capacitación."
good,I was hired on as a seasonal employee.  I worked as a merchandising specialist and was not required to push sells so it was a little more relaxed.  You were given your tasks and had to complete by the end of the day.  Overall not a bad job but definitely not a career.
good,If you are going to school or just like tech this is a fun place to work they do fun holiday events for staff. Pretty flexible with schedule a lot of managers so things can get heated.
good,"I enjoyed my job there, it was more like having fun than it was like working. The holidays were exciting and time went by so fast because we were always so busy."
good,Fun company to work for.  Learned a lot as far as selling skills and learned a lot about technology.  Good advancement opportunities.  One of my favorite jobs.
good,"So, I enjoyed working for them, but I was only employed seasonally. Also the training was a little to laissez faire. Meaning I felt like there was a lack of guidance when it came to completing the training. But, I still feel that it was a good job, and can lead you to a career path."
good,"I worked at Geek Squad, and even though I was making significantly more then the other retail employees I worked with I noticed that the amount of work that was asked of any individual their was never relevant to one's position but only whims of the management 'powers at be' that is as the management had a tendency to change every 6 months to 2 years."
good,"They pay better than other retail jobs, and employees are very knowledgeable and willing to teach. But the there are a lot of expectations of you. A lot of people want full-time, but there's very few positions to go around."
good,"In inventory, would start before opening hours to scan and update price tabs and restock inventory. Would receive product deliveries and place products throughout the work day, update price tabs if inconsistencies were detected, and answer questions/locate products for customers on the floor when approached. Developed attentive organization skills. Management would often remain hands-off when tasks were being completed correctly. Peers were more often than not friendly and helpful."
good,"they dont understand that we cant make money with no customers somedays . so they make us do pointless trainings. we know how to sell, but because a 60 year old woman looking for batteries doesnt want to buy an 85 inch samsung Q9 with a full 9.2 audio setup, completely installed by their geek squad, and pay for it all on a best buy credit card, its the sales associates fault. when you dont meet your goals 3 months in a row they will place you in the warehouse or fire you. so"
good,Mi estancia en Best buy es primordial mente por que fueron accesibles para otorgarme medio tiempo y apoyarme en actividades escolares.
good,Need to be able to think on your feet. Work life balance can be ruff. Pay is above average. Can make a living in this company. Would like to be able to move up eaiser.
good,"I had a great time working at Best Buy. That being said, I wasn't compensated enough to be able to live on the income I made there. When I was there they pushed a little too hard on the numbers. My fellow employees were amazing though. And the manager that was there when I was has since been fired. From what I've heard, they environment is much better involving upper management."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,For anyone who enjoys technology this is a great job! It's great seeing all the new tech that comes out and helping other people learn about some of the tech
good,Group oriented work evironment with flexible schedule.  Management was always willing to work with various scheduling conflicts but kept the entire team under control.  Trained properly and gave insightful knowledge on products and selling techniques.
good,"day to day was not too bad, management could be helpful and friendly, not much room for advancement in certain departments, decent pay but as with almost anywhere it could be better"
good,"It was a decent job, I felt like selling stuff came natural after sales induction class. I learned a lot from the class such as building repour the customers."
good,"Best Buy is a fun place to work, the people there are great."
good,The most enjoyable part of the day is being able to help a customer find exactly what he was looking for. As well as being able to answer any questions he has about a certain product.
good,"I worked for Best Buy for 5 years in two locations. I eventually became a Team Leader but was never able to rise higher due to the ""boys club"" environment in my particular store. This may not be the case for all locations but I know my district had very little diversity. I also found out that male employees in my department were paid better even though they were less experienced. "
good,"This place can be fun if you're able to get along with people easily. As Asset Protection, all customers and employees come to you. Make eye contact with all customers to welcome them to the store but at the same time letting them know that you see them (deterrent to theft). A lot of standing in a small area. Not cramped. You just can't leave the opening to the store. Management is key to morale. If your bosses are hard to work with, you're going to have a bad time. If there is too much employee drama, you're going to have a bad time. However, I enjoyed meeting new people and talking with customers. Helped my shift go by quicker. I didn't have an issues working at Best Buy, just wish I got paid more."
good,"Provides good benefits for employees. Can be very fast paced and must be able to keep up during the holidays. Must be willing to go above and beyond to get the job done, which will also help with being able to advance in the company."
good,"Pretty fast paced, tons learn, a lot of pressure to meet sales goals and credit applications.A great environment, nice location and very involved and helpful management team, I had a blast working there but the hours were a problem."
good,"Between checking in clients, shipping, troubleshooting and selling services, you'll never skip a beat and always be on top of doing something. You learn something new every day and there is a lot of customer service patience required."
good,Best Buy is a great place to work with a team full of driven and well rounded employees. The environment is one filled with positivity and individuals who all motivate and support each other.
good,"Overall the experience was typical of a customer service position except that the people were pretty tight nit and very welcoming. There was a good team vibe at all times and even to the extent that as a new person, one tends to feel as an outsider at times"
good,Great company to start off with and to get acclimated with different departments that you can challenge yourself with. People are awesome to work with for the most part.
good,"Worked with a lot of great people. Awesome employee discount, probably unbeatable actually. Sometimes you get the feeling that you could be a better manager than some of the ones there."
good,Best Buy creates a friendly environment for its employees that strives on positive atmosphere to create a good place to come and work. Everyone is friendly and excited about the technology they work with.
good,"The company as a whole, wasn't terrible. They offer great discounts, and the option for bonuses. If you are wanting to grow with the company, it will take a while. I have been with them for six years, and have yet to be able to get anywhere. They also are not above letting you know that you can be replaced."
good,This is a great place to work for college students and people looking to do a little more than just working any retail job. There are also plenty of opportunities for advancement within the company.
good,Great hours for people with lifestyles that require flexible hours managment helped out a lot with that but some of the guidelines were unnecessary and very few people agreed with them at all but while the corporation itself has problems I think the location I worked at overall had great people working for it.
good,"I'd rather work for Best Buy than another corporate retail entity. But it really varies on how you'll feel based on the management. I've worked there for 3 years and dont regret it one bit, but the opportunities for advancements dont really come around all that often; especially if you want/need to make more money. You'll work with great people that you'll want to actually be friend with, and you'll work with people you wont be too fond of"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"the management is good. but wages are't that great. the environment is friendly. "
good,"Besides the favoritism and inconsistency with management, not a bad place to work. The benefits are good very competitive. Problem lays with the staff not the company"
good,Great place to work if your in highschool or in college. They were flexible with hours and made it there job to give you as many hours you desire to have.
good,"Great leadership, great company to be a part of. Fast paced environment but a number of really smart and dedicated coworkers and they are committed to diversity and inclusion."
good,great company but the road to moving up can sometimes be stagnant but the company does provide good training and transferable skills. Although trying to create a career out of this would take the most exceptional work.
good,Best Buy is a fun place to work and learn about technology. The pay is decent but the company has been seemingly deceasing benefits lately. Discount is very good and culture is strong.
good,enjoyed the coworkers and direct superiors. work was well balanced and allowed for a lot of change and flexibility. it wasn't boring but sometimes the workload could be a little over bearing.
good,Competitive hourly pay despite what state the store is located in. Would have loved opportunity to earn commission when putting together bigger sales in order to get compensated for your efforts.
good,"Management has been accommodating with my work/life balance needs. Day to day workload varies, but offers flexibility for the most part especially in between jobs at client sites."
good,"I learned a lot f sales skills by working there. Staff and management are nice. However, pay is very low for the amount of work you are expected to do."
good,I think the company is great but I’ve outgrown it and looking for a new career path. I would like to afford for the future. I also would like a better schedule and and to not work holidays.
good,"One of the best places I've had the pleasure of working for. Staff and management very friendly and laid back. Great training, very knowledgeable about products and you also have virtual training to help you succeed. Not much else to say."
good,"I would usually work the opening shift which requires me to conduct a safety walk, daily count of valuable merchandise displays, and sign out keys and walkies to sales associates. All the staff was friendly and cooperative with preventing any theft. Hardest part when confronting a potential shoplifter and they want to be confrontational. I enjoyed the staff recognition events the manager had for all employees monthly."
good,"The Best Buy culture was a bit much at times, but I had a great Geek Squad lead. For a retail job I can't complain much. Even got to stay in a hotel for a weekend for a training ""get-away."" That was actually very fun and they paid us for 2 meals per day. "
good,I had an amazing experience while working at Best Buy. You almost gain a little family that you spend all of your time with. It is definitely a good first job if you like electronics.
good,"I’ve been at Best Buy for about 6 months now and I haven’t gotten a raise, haven’t gotten more hours, nothing. The schedule is all over the place and not very flexible and the managers are not very understanding of your outside circumstances. The work atmosphere with coworkers and customers is pretty cool though."
good,"Was a good company and people I worked with were great, I just wasn’t accustom to the retail world when I worked there so it was A LOT of pressure to get branded payments and to go talk to people that had already told you to go away"
good,"Have a great team, we watch out for another and help another out..the pay is decent but for the area it  could be much better. Leadership team is very understanding about life situations and are willing to help"
good,Good place to start for youngsters. Physically demanding as u need to stand/move for 8 hrs. Good learning and camaraderie. Advancement opportunities if u stick around and are diligent.
good,"Not a bad place to work. In my honest opinion, if you move up good. Otherwise it's a starter company. Work to provide stable income and find something better."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The best buy family is real. I made so many friends here and loved the time. Only left because I realized I wouldn't move up there and needed a new job after graduation from college.
good,"Enjoy working at Best Buy but room for advancement is minimal.  Good leadership, good pay.  Retail schedule can be burdensome during holidays.  Sometimes changes are made that aren't overly beneficial."
good,Asset Protection cannot sit. Boring and slow. Can drag on. Not bad pay but could be better. Law and policy limit job satisfaction and role. Depends on store.
good,Very quickly reached the maximum level in my position with not much room for advancement to management or higher level positions. Job was fun and the environment was enjoyable but would only recommend for entry level IT work.
good,Depending on the time or season work would either be slow and casual or fast-paced and sometimes hectic. At either pace it was important to keep in mind priorities for the task at hand and what can be done with the time that is allotted.
good,"As a permanent job, it is not ideal. It has very few full time positions and once hired on, regardless of attendance, getting better pay and hours is based off of the number of credit card applications and other services you sell to the customers. I do like that, for a corporate company, they treat their employees well. Getting hours as a part time employee is also based on your numbers, regardless of how much you need to work. As part time employee I do not qualify for a lot of the benefits available, but they do support goals outside of work, such as school, future careers, family, and hobbies. If you need someplace to work to make extra money, or work around other things you have going on, then its ideal for you."
good,"The first few days of working at best buy, are doing department specific training modules.... which can be fun sometimes, but there are so many. Leadership at Best Buy is EXTREMELY pushy about offering credit cards to every single customer. "
good,"Working for this company has more pros than cons When you’re a single mom in your early twenties, your perspective changes — fast. Everything changes. I had to work to support my daughter but, like most companies at the time, Best Buy didn’t offer any benefits that supported working parents who need certain care needs"
good,"Work was really straight forward, hours fair, pay was good. The job was honestly a lot better than I expected. Until Geek Squad became an Authorized Apple Service Provider (AASP). When that rolled out we had to spend a huge amount of time to take Apple's training to repair their devices. Agents got absolutely no pay raise to account for the added responsibility. There were few hours dedicated to training so most of it was done on top of the immense amount of other repairs coming in (for most precincts). Once it officially launched it was an absolute mess. Geek Squad agents have been quitting all over the country, which just makes the situation even worse.  Before AASP I would highly recommend Geek Squad, since then I advice you stay away for a little until the dust settles."
good,"Best Buy is a great company to work for if you're looking to get into sales, technology, or really anything that requires you to have people skills and communication skills. People who work here end up moving on to very different types of jobs, whether thats sales, technology, insurance, marketing, etc. Some people decide that Best Buy is their last stop and take it as far as they can, ending up in management or even corporate if they stick to it long enough. Great people, great environment, good benefits."
good,"There are always things to do at Best Buy. I was mostly in the warehouse filling orders or helping my customer service representatives. There are plenty of tasks to keep you busy, with that being said you can get noticed quickly if you constantly ask managers what is the next task that needs to be done."
good,"It's an okay job. Great for high school students. Wouldnt really recommend for someone that is looking for a career. One great thing is the discounts on products. "
good,Workplace culture is strong. Teamwork is promoted. They are willing to train you. Schedule is flexible. Compensation is fair for an entry level job. Field work keeps each day fresh.
good,Good place but man if you stay in one place to much or you’re in a small store it gets so old so fast. I left partially due to family emergencies but the sheer boredom of the same products with no chance to learn anything new really drug me down.
good,Best Buy is a company that was a joy to work for. Keeping up on the latest products and services for the customers was one of the most enjoyable experiences.
good,"-Great discounts"
good,"Pros: compensation with steady raise each year, benefits, office location, good company values, culture can be fun depending on which department"
good,"I was able to pick up various skills from best buy. For example, dealing with customers that were not happy or explaining the features of the product and the payment program. It also helped me improve my social skills."
good,"Good to start out in, but if you want to move up, you will need to show some dedication and know the right people. My advancement was hindered due to knowing too much."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best Buy was a great place to work when selling things I enjoyed and was passionate about. The management ruined that tho with pushy credit card pitches and up selling when customers clearly are uninterested. My location manager played favorites heavily.
good,"As been part of the warehouse, it was the easiest and hardest thing, It doesn't require too much thinking but it requires more physical work which is a con"
good,its fun and they really work around your hours if you have another job or have school plus its fun because the employees make it fun but its hard to grown within the store
good,"Best Buy was a great job, it had it's benefits to get discounts and flexible hours with coworkers. Management was very understanding and was able to understand and work with you on personal and work issues."
good,One of the better retail places you can work at but retail is retail. Compensation is on of the higher pays in the area and benefits are really nice when it comes to working full time.
good,"I really like working here. In fact my current position is ideal to my current situation, I just need more hours than can apparently be accommodated. Management is kind and at the very least gives the appearance of being in your corner. Though I admitt that communication with management leaves a little to be desired. Work culture is one of collaboration and positivity on the most part. It's a good place work 9 months out of the year, the holidays are nearly untenable but the increase in hours takes the edge off a little. I would not be considering leaving at all if I was getting more hours or a full time phone operator position was available anywhere else."
good,"I enjoyed working there overall, sometimes hours were cut but mianly raimined consistent. I would say they were pushy about credit cards but other than that no complaints."
good,"Working at Best Buy has helped me improve my people skills, hold conversations, and be more out going. The management at Best Buy truly tries their best to help you improve, they really do care about their team."
good,I enjoyed it but I got let go since I was seasonal employee.  I enjoyed working with people and interacting with the customers and making sure they were satisfied. Also during my time working for Best Buy I got an experience that made me realize that I like working with people.
good,best buy overall was a decent job with little advancement. The family atmosphere is what made it a friendly and happy place to work overall. The main issue was compensation and work hours. For the amount of money made by the sales staff it was not properly compensated to the actual workers.
good,"Depending on the Best Buy location the opportunity for advancement varies heavily. In my experience my store had a line of people waiting for different opportunities, but at many other stores positions open frequently and moving up has many opportunity for driven employees"
good,Was able to use my knowledge and help out customers while still being able to have fun in a professional manner. The sales goals were a bit unrealistic however and were very hard to hit some months.
good,"While I do appreciate the experience and the people I worked with, Best Buy often pushed us to make more sales and offer products and services in a way typical to a commission environment whilst only paying us at an hourly rate.  I often sold over $200k in various products monthly and even more during the holidays. They will definitely teach you how to be a good salesperson.  The paperwork you had to fill out with customers was often annoying, but it did help facilitate transactions at the end.  "
good,"A typical day was a slow start with not many customers in the store. Floor supervisor would provide us with daily goals to hit as in sales, credit applications, and to maintain a clean sales floor. The hardest part was when on certain days it would only be 2 employees covering multiple areas of the store."
good,Decent place to work if you are into retail and are willing to put up with seasonal ops tempo and have good communication and customer service skills.
good,"I worked there part time while I was finishing up college. It is easily the best retail job I have ever had. It can get a little competitive in reference to how much you are selling geek squad or extended warranties, but as a NON CAREER job it was perfect. However, if you were to attempt at career in retail, Best Buy is a job I would recommend. Especially because they adjust your wage based on minimum wage increases and talent (at least they did when I was there)"
good,"I liked the job, my coworkers and supervisors."
good,"For a retail job the company was fun, offered decent benefits, and good time off at the management level. Pay was competitive, but work life balance was non-existent for salaried managers."
good,"A typical work day involves up selling customers."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Empresa buena para trabajar con horarios flexibles
good,"It was an exciting place to work with a diverse workforce. I learned a great deal."
good,"A place that is great fun to work because of the team you are a part of. Management is great, they try to get to know you and are always willing to work with you and are understanding of you."
good,Really good entry level job with reasonable work hours. Everyone is extremely professional and easy to work with. Can get fairly hectic during the holidays and big sales days so be ready to work consecutive long shifts.
good,"Good environment at work, and managers are relatively strict, but also understanding about workload. During holiday times, store can get busy. Managers are pretty strict about work times, and aren't very understanding about changes in work times."
good,The job is fun and fast paced but I feel you are not paid enough for the area. But if you are good under pressure it is a great job. Just note the amount of sales you make is very important.
good,"The Geek Squad is no joke. You get a a lot of experience with technology. This is a great place to step your foot in the door within the IT department. Whether you are a consultation agent or repair agent, you get lots of hands on experience with computers and meet a lot of people with computer issues. This can be a very demanding job and can sometimes push you to the limits of stress. The outcome of working here though is that you become very respected in the IT world for a plethora of businesses that need an IT professional."
good,"First thing in the morning I process inventory paper work, pick orders and receive product. Throughout the day I maintain organization in the warehouse and pick customer orders. I also load and unload DDC and RDC trucks, as well as other vendor trucks. The culture is diversified and Management is supportive in achieving positive results. The hardest part of my job is dealing with  employees that have no drive or pride in performing their daily tasks."
good,"Overall the company is amazing to work for, the only down factor is the pay is not enough to sustain a standard of living and there is not a lot of room to move."
good,I liked my time at best buy looking back at it. the people were nice and many coworkers become life long friends. I still see people on facebook who worked there together all get together to hang out and catch up.
good,Great company to learn about a true sales environment without working on commission. Many routes you can go with the company but internal growth can be a challenge. Store culture varies from store to store you'll never have the same experience with management or daily store operation.
good,Best Buy has great employee incentives. The only con would be the customers screaming at you and management eventually giving in to their ridiculous demands
good,"can be fun but moving up is very competitive, especially when you don't know anyone.. generally, though, the people that work there all love the field that they're in, making for a more positive work experience"
good,"Working here to support my family while also maintaining steady, full-time school workload.  I made quite a few friends.  Pay raises are very low, even with promotion.  Leaving to work in the field of my study."
good,"Very enjoyable job, enjoyed my time here. My manager was good to work with as well as it was easy to work with others here at best buy. I enjoyed my time here only problem was I was hired only seasonal."
good,Enjoy the people ad Management.  Very understanding and collaborative work place. Always innovative to new items coming into the market. Have a great working system that makes it great for employees. Also offer continuous online training.
good,Working at Best Buy was a fun and great learning experience but it wasn't necessarily my flavor because of the extremely emotional customers from high priced purchases No Further comment.
good,"Best Buy was a good place to work in retail, especially if you are proficient with technology. Everything is strictly salary, so you do not have to compete with others for sales, which leads to a more collaborative environment."
good,Work Hard at this job and it'll pay off. As one of their top performers I was able to say it was a good experience. Its like any other job you got work hard to get some respect. Also performing at 85% should make you a decent worker but  if you want to move the ranks make sure to work at 100% all the time you're there. To move to the ranks must have a good relation with at least the one of the main managers in the store and also back it up with numbers and expect to either get bumped to who's next on being supervisor or get lucky by putting your work where your mouth is to get that higher position. Overall do recommend working there if you like the retail life. I personally left due to getting a job within the degree i studied but would have gladly stayed. Would like to also give a shoutout to the training they give at the store the company in general does care about their employees being ready to sale what products best buy offers. Each Employee is good in one department mainly cause of personal preference. If you like tv and audio then youll be good at that department but might suck at computers and its completely understandable but everyone has their weakness and the store does its best to overcome shyness and also make sure youre prepared to sell a product on the sales floor.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Geek Squad thoroughly promotes culture and diversity. We have a robust community outreach program as well as an employee enagagement team dedicated to enhancing the employee experience.
good,"While it was a good place to work sometimes the employee or management culture at certain stores leaves a lot to be desired. For instance, once we switched GMs at the location I was at, the job got a lot less desirable to work for at that specific location"
good,"Honestly, the company had lots of opportunities for growth and self-education. Plus, they have college tuition assistance too. The only thing I found frustrating in my time there was the lack of female engagement on the actual sales floor. The women worked primarily as cashiers or at the service desk and that annoys me to this day (that hasn't changed much)"
good,Good and cooperative atmosphere. Good starting pay with annual merit raises. Fair and accommodating management staff. Large customer base with many repeat customers. Staff is very courteous and knowledgeable..
good,Bestbuy is a great place to work. They are flexible on scheduling and understand your future goals and aid you in assisting with future developing within the company.
good,"I learned a lot working in best buy mobile."
good,Good entry level job that help build interpersonal skills. Selling skills are used all of  your life. Good place to grow that talent. If you are not trying to be a professional Salesman or woman then job will take its toll on you somewhat.
good,I enjoyed my short stay at best bu. I was a seasonal employee but i can say the pay is nice and most of the other workers were friendly. The atmosphere was very competitive though as if you were working on commission.
good,"I started as a seasonal sales associate, and worked my way up to the supervisor side. I had a wonderful team, of which each individual brought his or her own bit of pizazz to the table - making work great. We had our individual targets, but would be rewarded further if we hit as a store which to me was great. I enjoyed the management that I worked under, as they found fun ways to incentivize hitting harder to reach goals. The hardest part would definitely be the unsteady flow of foot-traffic on a typical weekday being in a mall area, making it slightly more difficult to hit daily goals. Other than that, this job was quite enjoyable."
good,"Constantly pushed to sell credit cards. They want you to push the sells but at the same time ""police"" people to cut down on shrink. Constantly have someone in your ear talking about numbers."
good,good sales experience and helps you learn the basics of sales environment as well as customer service experience. Pay could be better considering expectation of work quality.
good,Too many duties with too little pay. Very fun culture and work environment. Very good hours and reasonable breaks. Management has a double standard...
good,"Had fun working in Geek Squad, however it is still retail so dealing with angry customers is never fun. Management is reasonable and payscale is comparable to other retail jobs."
good,The people that I worked with is the reason I was there so long. We all worked well as a team. I've learned a lot of skills from my all my employees that made me a worker.
good,"A great company that struggles with bureaucracy and middle management politics. The culture is superb, but be wary of investing too heavily and losing a proper work-life balance."
good,"Best Buy has one of the best retail work environments for its employees, and pay is fairly competitive. The employee discount is unbeatable."
good,"I've been a consultation agent for the past three years, and I have loved it overall. The job can be stressful at times -- clients can sometimes misunderstand what is going on or be impolite, but overall there's a great deal of satisfaction from helping someone with computer troubles."
good,Best Buy is great place to work if you just need a seasonal job. Hours are flexible and you enjoy the same employee discount as regular employees. Promotions are merit based for the most part.
good,"Supportive management. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,It is very hard to transition from part time to full time employment with Best Buy. If you are seen as a friend of the managers you will excel otherwise you will be kept in part time employment for your duration at Best Buy.
good,permiten trabajar con expectativas claras aunque en ocasiones lo valores que promueve la compañia solo se viven a nivel tienda y no se notan en los niveles superiores como distritales
good,It was a wonderful experience working with Best Buy Distribution Center. Though It was a short period of time. I would love to work with Best Buy agai
good,You deal with a variety of different customers. Some would be in a good mood and others not so much. I have dealt with a lot of customers that didn't understand instructions.
good,"I picked up some nice skills while with Geek Squad. The team in the precinct was cool to work with although a little lacking until reminded to carry their weight. the GM and ASM were cool most the time until they had some brilliant notion to implement a new rule not affecting them. The customers were the most interesting part. While there were not as many disgruntled clients at Geek Squad, due to the team going above and beyond to keep them happy, they were almost always a pleasure to talk to and could have some of the best stories."
good,I would recommend Best Buy to anyone that is in school looking for part time. If your looking for full time employment searching for something else might be in your best interest.
good,Best part about working for Best Buy were the people. I have a handfull of best friends that I met working at Best Buy. This company is great to learn how to multi task and be proactive.
good,"Best Buy will always enable you to make a sale. There are plenty of resources available to make it easier, plus a full database of product knowledge. If you have drive, you will thrive at Best Buy. Sales Floor leadership is usually good because they started at the same level, and have learned from experience."
good,"- Best Buy/Geek Squad believes firmly in their culture"
good,"Working at best buy can be fun and rewarding but they heavily focus on your numbers, even if you're a member of geek squad which can cause a bit of stress to make your numbers. If you're a great sales person Best Buy would be a perfect fit for you. Otherwise you'll have a bad experience."
good,"It’s an okay job especially for a first job or a second job, but no advancements, unless someone leaves or passes. Need to be up to date on all the latest technologies."
good,"I normally worked 5 days a week for 35 hrs. I was trained to always be persistent on how you sell. Now Management, I have had some horrible managers and he was a eventually fired but now, the managers are great!"
good,I was challenged to complete my tasks under a short amount of time and effectively communicate hardware and software issues. I enjoyed that I constantly had something to do while working in Geek Squad.
good,"Doesn't ask for much and doesn't take much to accomplish the tasks. It's a decent gig to say the least. A little bit strict on rules that don't necessarily make sense, but it's alright."
good,"it wasn't that bad the employees were nice, the customers were okay too im just typing stuff because it wont let me go to the next page so yeah idk lol"
good,"Working at Best Buy on a daily basis brought about its challenges each and every day. Some days are slower and business is steady but not overwhelming. Other days, such as holiday season, is crazy busy, with people all over the place. I enjoyed working with other employees and communicating with customers while I was in Asset Protection. I also think it was one of the more difficult positions, having to prevent potential theft and actual theft where the police get involved. Customer issues could be difficult at times, but management was very knowledgeable and assisted in resolving conflict. I learned how to handle cash in a fast paced environment, stay up to date on current deals and offers."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, se necesita mas tiempo para descansos."
good,Best Buy is a great place to start in technology. There is room for advancement (although not always in your store). It is a fast pace environment with high expectations. The only cons would be that management makes or breaks your experience and the occasional customer that ruins your day.
good,Enjoyed my time there working as a customer service specialist. I also cashiered and helped replenish inventory. Hours were rough but was a family atmosphere.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,lack of focus and accountability.  Overall it has been a good company to work for but the compensation is low for the amount of work and retail life stress
good,"It's a good place to work the people there are friendly and willing to help you if needed ."
good,Best Buy has a good work atmosphere. The mission of the company is clear and understandable. Employees are empowered within the company. There is a strong sense of a team.
good,"Working here, you get the opportunity to work with co-workers who are willing to help, support, and teach you if you need help. Also a great way to learn how to work on a team."
good,Overall I enjoyed my time at best buy. The management was very nice and understood work life balance. The management tried their best to provide what they could with the budget they had. They pushed and believed in their employees to win and to provide excellent service.
good,"How can you not love working at Best Buy? The latest technology and services. The struggle as with any retailer is turnover of associates in the face of the customer. You would have no problem finding associates with longevity in support roles outside the store and corporate. The first retailer to balance this out might just win. I truly believe that Best Buy will be around for a long time. Meaning they continue to prove everyone wrong for the last decade all we hear is people shopping online and show-rooming means the end of brick and mortar. I hope Best Buy sticks around and finds a way to celebrate, motivate, and retain store leaders and associates. In Best Buys best days they focused on the employees and happy engaged employees took care of their customers and bottom line."
good,"Each Best Buy is unique, so every review will vary. This particular one had a lot of shining areas, but there were a few people who just made the experience a negative one."
good,"Great environment to learn more about products and how to sell properly. Sometimes feels like you are stuck in a loop, but helps with perseverance and growing knowledge."
good,"I worked for Best Buy for over 5 years, and while it is a nice company to work for, there is very little room for growth. Some people who have been there 10+ years are just now able to move up into supervisor roles."
good,Good place to work. Learn alot of beneficial information and company is run relatively well. Very much treated as a career as opposed to a job which is an issue sometimes when most employment is part time college students.
good,"I worked on the Merchandising Team in the late 90's. It was a really fast paced enviroment, trying to get the store to look it's best before we opened each day. We also set the weekly ads each Sunday."
good,"Its a good job to have. Its a job you can count on. Good family group. They are an understanding place of work, when it came to personal issues. Management has good communication with employees."
good,"Enjoyed working with Best Buy and the team of installers - relaxed atmosphere great discount."
good,"Not the most difficult job, talking to people and helping them in right fitting the proper goods and services according to their lifestyle. Also requiring lots of standing and mediocre incentives to sell and add on services."
good,"I really enjoy working at Best Buy. The people are awesome and there are a lot of experienced workers. Although the atmosphere is relaxed, it does sometimes get hectic. For example, Black Friday and other holidays. For the amount of work that I do, I don't feel like I am fairly compensated. I work hard and I do other tasks that need done after finishing the one that I had completed. I am not scheduled for said tasks nor am I required to do them, however I still do them because they need completed. I've been with Best Buy for 9 months now and I barely make enough to afford a one bed and one bath apartment. All that being said, I do enjoy working there and I plan on working there as a side job when I start my career."
good,It wasn't a terrible work environment it was the people made it hard. Was steady work to be done and was not too difficult. Some people took it to an extreme.
good,"Fast paced environment that allows for growth in subject matter, however lack of growth within the company. Great place to work as a part time job but pay does not always reflect effort."
good,It was a good first job to learn at. I learned quite a bit about how to handle customers and what to do in stressful situations. It was an overall good place to work
good,"The people you meet is incredible. Even after my employment, I keep in touch with them. The work environment is pretty great, and they really work with you. My biggest complaint, is that the pressure to up-sell customers is super severe. If you don't work well under pressure, this will get to you."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Fine place to work, I'm really not interesting in writing more on this subject. They offer a ground floor for people to get into the IT world. The advancements are fine."
good,"Cool job for temporary things, stay in the yellow to avoid termination. Always be early or best experience. 15 minute breaks are pretty good. Wonderful in time planning with students."
good,"A typical day at work a light hearted and fun experience.  I learned a lot more about repairing computers and how to talk to clients at this job.  Management was exemplary at this job.  The hardest part of the job is honestly the low hours and pay paired with some rude customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is just the environment honestly, everyone is very friendly and helpful"
good,"Consistently and accurately complete stock counts"
good,"Geek Squad has given me a great balance of teaching people how to use their technology with fixing things on my own. However, when it comes to relying on my teammates for support is when things start to fall apart. On numerous occasions, I leave exact instructions on what needs to get done on which machines and I come in the next day to find none of it done. Besides that, the staff and management are friendly, the store is clean and the discount is great."
good,"Quick past work for hard working people.its seasonal, so many won't get yearly work. Security checks when your done working as you leave. On time breaks and lunches is good. Team work the whole shift of work."
good,"working there with everyone was great, but the managers never communicated with one another so you would one thing one day and the complete opposite the next. The GM is one of the most hard working people I have met but his people skills are subpar."
good,"I was young and inexperienced, but they took me in and trained me to be knowledgeable and eventually one of the best. However, I didn't feel as if I was being compensated properly for the work that I've been producing. I gave them a chance to provide that to no avail and I left, but I really didn't want to. I loved being able to work alongside some amazing consultants and vendor reps, and most of all, being around some sort of music throughout my entire shift. Had I been given the compensation I asked for, which was not much by the way, like a 50cent raise per hour, I would've stayed in a heartbeat."
good,The people are nice and workplace is relaxed and very competitive. enjoyed working with different technologies. learning new programs ans systems. talking to different kind of people from different cultures.
good,"Manager/supervisor orders often conflict with the ability to hit sales targets by forcing you to complete other tasks and making you leave the department on a regular basis. This even happens if you are the only employee assigned the the entire department at the time. They also force geek squad to ""repair"" protected devices under their warranty plans until the device completely falls apart, instead of replacing the device after x number of repairs. ""Personal/Family Experience"""
good,"I had two tours at Best Buy headquarters. Like all companies, my experience had ups and downs. However, having been at other large companies, I realize that I took the culture for granted. I would definitely work there again if given the opportunity."
good,The team was a close group that helped each other.  The facility had just opened so everyone felt like they were a part of something special.  Team events kept morale high.  Peak season was the most challenging part of the job.
good,I loved my job at Best Buy and the customers I worked with but I was unable to live off the wages they paid me. Best Buy is a great intro into sales. They provide a decent amount of training and it was a lot of fun going into work each day.
good,The management and employees were of great help when you had any questions about your job and are more than willing to help out no matter what it may be.
good,"I enjoyed working at best buy because they have a great enviroment and some what good communication with the team"
good,When it isn't the holidays time moves slow and business is down. When the Holidays come around time moves much faster and it is a fun work environment to be in. sadly that is only 5 months out of the year.
good,Decent place to work. I learned a lot from a couple of managers who I worked with and under.Great vacation options and flexible hours.Overall desired placed to work and can learn a few things.
good,"Not bad place to work. The work was not bad, people were great there.  Learned a lot about IT and leadership.  Company had many excellent qualities that they transcended to employees."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"it was a good place to work while i was in shcool, it was a lot of work to do but i had good managers and they helped work around my school schedule. It was hard because i would have to work nights, weekends and holidays."
good,I've found BestBuy to be an enjoyable place to work.  Projects are many and challenging.  I've learned quite a bit there and do enjoy my job.  The work year is compressed into about 8 months as there are no changes to technology during the Christmas holiday season.  It makes for a fast paced and sometimes pressure filled environment.
good,Great place as a college student or secondary employment during the holidays. Competitive pay and GREAT discounts. Coworkers are usually pretty nice people.
good,"The work at Best Buy is not difficult and the pay is compensating enough. The problem that I had during my time at Best Buy was that management or supervisors would eventually begin to push more things on you that time in your shift permitted, after which begin to expect it is done before leaving. This could have been from my location as I did not change locations."
good,"Overall good retail company to work for. Excellent discounts for employees. Hours mostly flexible, over time available. Great for students, part-time/full time. Advancement optional"
good,"Good atmosphere and place to work.  Work was consistent, benefits and perks were good. Job wasn't to hard or demanding. Store discounts were great during the holiday seasons."
good,"The good things about the job is the culture it fosters. I've met some of my best friends at this job and it truly was a fun working environment. A lot of the negatives come from management. People being promoted solely from being there the longest, not necessarily having the best skill set for the job. My manager took critiques or criticisms very personally and would react accordingly. Not a great quality for a superior but that's what it was. Tons of opportunity to move up even if its not in the same store, and very good about what it takes to get to the next level. It may take a few years and stellar numbers but it will get you to where you want to go. "
good,It was a fun place to work. A lot of the associates and managers were very helpful. It was not for me only because I focused more on Loss Prevention and they were looking for more of a door greeter and not Loss Prevention. I felt I could not use all my skills to help the store
good,Good place for young adults. Customer service issues were always handled professionally. All of us team members were knowledge about the products we were selling.
good,Good place to work at lacked management when i worked there. Great people as well get to know alot about electronics. Fun atmosphere and  a place where you can alwaya be busy.
good,"I had the privilege of working at a very busy and successful store. It was faced paced and I learned a lot. A great place for me to work in my early 20s."
good,"BB is a fun place to work. You are challenged daily, and with the right team around you, the culture makes it easier to get through the tough times. Since BB isn't a commission driven environment much of the pressure to hit goals falls on the managers ability to drive the business through relationships rather than monetary incentives. Relationships are everything at BB. "
good,It was a very fun place to work and pushed you out your comfort zone to be better. I learned a lot about technology and used that knowledge towards life situations.
good,"If you enjoy electronics, people or working with other people who enjoy those things, you'll have a good time at best buy. The people there are blunt, real, motivated, funny and sometimes even friendly. Going into work at best buy is an adventure, and there's always an opportunity to make every day count, and some managers give you really good advice about how to do your job (like mine did). The only downsides to working here are that (while it's not commission) you will be in competition with other people on the floor, which doesn't always encourage teamwork. Besides not encouraging teamwork, the pay also isn't very good, and it's very hard to get a full time position at best buy or stay on after the holiday. Even if you do everything that they tell you to do, it's not a guarantee of better things. The compensation also isn't very good. wwouldn't recomend trying to make a care"
good,Enjoyed working at best buy however I'm told every store is different. It's a great company to work for. Benefits are good. Being a supervisor is where the money is though.
good,"With the right co workers and managers Best Buy can be a wonderful place to work. Without those however, it can be a challenging experience. I would scope out the Best Buy you are planning on working at before applying."
good,"I wasn't too sure on what I wanted to do with my career, but Best Buy gave me skills that led me to advance and create better opportunities. I gained a lot of knowledge and am using it wisely."
good,"It was a fun places, the other workers and supervisors would all joke around and laugh. It was a very relaxed place and they helped you learn what you needed to do and found out what you were good at."
good,Good experience.  I was rapidly promoted through the ranks of leadership and rewarded from my hard work and performance.  The only downside was compensation and hours.
good,"Typical day at work is starting at 4, 5, or 6am. Tasked with specific duties each day that are realistic to complete. I learned good time management skills. The hardest part about working there is the hours and the fact that no one really wants to come to work. Less employees working means more work for others. A lot of times work was never completed or half way completed which caused frustration. Most enjoyable part was work events and clocking out earlier in the day everyday."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"As the Service Manager, my responsibilities included making sure the guests had a great experience in maintaining the restaurant at a high capacity. This included maintaining the store by repairing or replacing any parts that needed. Also, I would make sure the store's money was counted and all in order for weekly operations. Another aspect of my title is employee life. I would hire and train future candidates. I took care of payroll and schedules. As well as managing the staff in their daily tasks. My final duty was to promote my store and get sales. This included canvassing around the city, create and handle all promotions, and finally offering to participate in community events in order to spread the word. In doing so, my stores ranking nationally was number 9 overall out of 2200."
good,"If you get a good manager/supervisor then you will be happy... if not you will be miserable.  When initially hired on they will try and give you the lowest amount possible.  This then effects your future pay, etc. Do not let them low ball you."
good,"Day at Work:"
good,"It’s a good place to work , latest leadership in some areas of store no so good . More care for sales gloor than the position they are in charge of leading too co works not doing or proforming duties ."
good,"very diverse, competitive, fun. "
good,"I started here as part time and slowly earned my way to a full time position. On a typical day I would be in selling and training new people. I learned a lot about technologies, and their developments. I also learned how to properly deal with customers and how to make sure they left the store feeling satisfied and likely to return. The hardest part of the job was working during black friday (or black Thursday) due to the amount of customers and their issues, and the little time to fix them."
good,"There's a lot the company teaches you and a lot you can allow yourself to learn. It's a team culture with everyone making efforts to a common goal. "
good,I worked in Geek Squad during and after college. It's a great entry job for someone wanting to work in IT. Learned a lot about break/fixing. Also taught me great customer service
good,Learned a lot at best buy. Worked in sales don't have anything against best buy just hoping for a change in companies. Caring co-workers and managers really looked after the employees
good,"Great place, good people. Sales targets were stupid at times, management couldve been better but oh well. I like it while it was in college but dont think its practical now."
good,"The culture is positive, tends to not focus on the bigger picture.  Not much room for growth.  Depends on the store and managers.   I enjoyed the technology, did not enjoy the day to day cleaning/ stocking that was required by the salesfloor.  The focus is on sales, but the stocking was a unrealistic requirement."
good,Decent job to work at. Typically a fun environment to work with. Working with the newest technology as it releases is probably the best part of working there and being a tech nerd.
good,"I am an ambitous person and Best Buy is not the best place for people that want to become something in life. With that being said, it's a great starter job."
good,"It is a fast-pace environment, had great coworkers and it was a fun place at times. I loved working there until the last few months. But that had more to do with the management brought in at the time. I would recommend Best Buy as a great place to work though."
good,"The company did an outstanding job making me enjoy coming to work every day. I've worked for this company for over a decade and that wouldn't be possible if I dreaded coming in."
good,They will accommodate your schedule the best that they can. It is a competitive workplace because they want you to sell products and service plans. I would recommend working here part time and/or you need flexible hours. Nice management.
good,it was cool place to work I learned how to care of shipping for home and how to get the store ready for seasonal sales.An average day was very fast paced.
good,"The job itself is not very demanding, and helping clients find a solution to their current problem can more often than not be done within the stores offerings. For other, more extreme, problems there is a process in place to help the client find a solution from a team at the corporate purchasing level."
good,"Working there was great.  Everytime i would go to work i will feel like i was needed there. There was once my car got ruined and my manager woke up early just to pick me up at home, and drive me to work.  Best experience ever."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I really enjoyed working here. Sometimes the schedule was a mess, but we always made it work out. Learned a lot about technology with the courses that they offer and the discounts can be pretty good."
good,Expected top do day-to-day tasks efficiently and effectively. Managers are very helpful while also expecting you to know what you're doing. Much of the job is done on your own with some collaboration with team members and division of tasks. Overall a very laid back environment with opportunity to take on new responsibilities.
good,This company truly knows how to have fun while being the best. Great group of people from all walks of life to learn and work with. This is the place for positive people.
good,"Great place to work but the holiday rush can be very challenging for anyone. Working around all of the new technology helps keep you ""connected"" to the latest and greatest things. Great employee discount."
good,The workplace of great. The leaders are supportive and motivated as well. The keep up the culture and will provide help when needed. You also get to brush your inter personal skills.
good,Cool place to work. Depends on the store but some have better management than others. The CEO has good ideas that help the smaller workers. They helped out the families that worked in the best buy in Purto Rico during and after the hurricanes of 2017 and that was really cool.
good,"Best Buy is a fun and engaging workplace with plenty of challenges and opportunities. It can just be a part time job for those who are looking to take advantage of the extremely generous discounts, but there is also growth for those are looking to make a career out of it."
good,"If you're looking for a job in sales that is fun to work at Best Buy is a pretty good option. Typical day is being in your department(computers, home theater, mobile, etc...) and helping customers find what they need. Gross profit is how they keep track of your sales and are serious about you meeting goal. Management wasn't that great but the people you work with are amazing."
good,"Good breaks, great people.  I work in customer service, and while the customers are sometimes hard to deal with, at my location, the team I work with is simply the best.  I always have a good time at work."
good,"i enjoy my position at best buy, i feel there are plenty of opportunity to move around in the company, but at the store level when a manager doesn't like you, they make sure you know they don't like you."
good,"Working with people is always a positive. You have the ability to work with a large group of individuals within various departments. The opportunity for development and growth is available, especially if you have a flexible schedule and are willing to relocate."
good,"Overall, things at Best Buy were pretty easy. There wasn't any stress to sell items to people. We focused more on making sure the customer was informed and received the help they needed."
good,"While the culture focused on development of  strong associates and servant leadership, it would change month by month where results by any means would trump the experience of the customer."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work for, the people are fun, the wages are competitive and the culture is not comparable. As a lead you have all of the responsibility with none of the pay, all of the expectations and none of the power to change any of it. Even when you make decisions that are in the best interest of the company your managers make you feel like you are incompetent and don't know what you are doing. This goes for my specific location, I have worked with plenty of other managers over the years that are delightful and supportive and encourage you to make the risk calls when they know you have the capacity to do what you know is right."
good,Best Buy was a fast pace every changing company. The  company focused on developing the associates to deliver knowledgeable customer interactions. Adding service/protection plans was a key part of an associates evaluation. Leadership at the top had a vision for the company and invested the time and resources to achieve it. The company consistently went through internal reorganizations which did not produce a since of security in one role.
good,"Like most places politics can make or break an experience, best buy is no different. If you are looking to advance however, all the resources you need are available."
good,The job is pretty easy. Most people are pretty laid back. Most departments work a Sunday through Thursday schedule. You are required to work on all holidays except Christmas and Easter. Peak season is a little ridiculous. You work 6 days a week and are scheduled for 9 hours each day.
good,"All around good place to be, but at the location I was at the management was poor at conducting itself. Mobile department is a great team and a great time."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I worked there long enough to learn how to make it through the day as well as the holidays. But it's retail, so all holidays had to be taken at awkward times, and the management team changed so often that it made one wonder what happened in those ""team lead meetings"". Great place to start and help you understand the corporate world, but not the company you should spend your whole life with."
good,You do not make commission but it is a very clicky company.  If you are on the in with the managers you get the schedules you want.  Once you become a supervisor the stress roll down from up top gets much more extreme just a ROLLS down hill scenario.
good,"Great place to work for college students, sometimes management will micromanage. My supervision was very flexible with my work schedule for class or other stuff I had to do."
good,it was fun to learn new things on the job and about the people working there. i liked learning about the products being sold there and talking to new customers ever day.
good,"Helping the clients always come first. Being human is extremely important. Remember to stay focused, and help them help you. Cura Et Celeritas! Be the Agent of Change"
good,"I love working here, the employees are awesome and helpful and management in general is very helpful and fair too. It has an awesome employee environment and we are almost like family sometimes. My only complaint is there are sometimes not a lot of hours to go around, and if your hours are cut it is really hard sometimes to get them back up. I work part time, but most weeks my hours were in the single digit range. But it is still a great place to work at, the employees, the discounts, the atmosphere and the harder you work the better things can get there."
good,"Nice experience. Good for developing customer sales skills. Its hands on, with good people (which is always a plus). Takes some a bit of time to get accustomed."
good,"For more than 6 years, I mostly enjoyed working for the company. My last 3 weren't as enjoyable, promotion selections were highly questionable. I enjoyed the employee benefits. Most of the team members were friendly, respectable, and willing to work, but due to being an entry level position, you tended to get people who were disinterested/unwilling to go the extra mile for a customer or a High School aged teenager who were there to make a buck."
good,Best Buy focuses on empowering its employees so they can in turn empower the customer. Its a great place for development. What you put in you get out. Highly recommended.
good,The job was fine. I was a little disappointed I could not cross train in different departments. You are locked into whatever position you get hired in and it takes a lot of luck and friends to get moved to a different department.
good,Definitely not a temporary job but it does allow you to learn how retail works. It helps you appreciate the life outside of retail. Good start in a technology career but definitely not a permanent job.
good,"I learned how to balance a customers needs and be more efficient with my time management leading to more sales and returning business. Also management was very helpful in difficult situations, made the tasks at hand much easier to accomplish"
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work with the variety of people you can meet, as well as the coworkers who make the job enjoyable. Best Buy can be considered a ""comfortable"" job, but it is very difficult to move up in the company. Management generally has an idea as to who they want to move up, and will work with them on how they can, however they tend to write off some who would like to move up in the company due to the employees skills at selling or how well they are performing. The workplace and environment is fun and enjoyable, but it isn't very good at helping the employees grow."
good,"i never worked here as a employee but only as a coop student, it was a good couple months and i learned alot to do with the warehouse and was even able to sell a couple things to people."
good,"If you plan on making it a career, make sure you move into multiple departments, get experience at everything.  The mistake most who plan on staying long-term make is finding a department you like and sticking with it.  Upper management prefers a well-rounded candidate for moving them up, rather than a career employee in a single field."
good,Best Buy is a retailer focusing on the electronics for everyday life. Fast paced and can be stressful on busy day. They are open 7 days a week. Holiday is generally the busiest time of the year. Store management can differ greatly from store to store. MUST be able to speak to the customer on their level.
good,"Best Buy was a pretty decent place to work. The pay wasn't great for the area, but it was still above the minimum. The scheduled shifts, however, went up and down - opening one day and closing the next and vice versa. Management was friendly and helpful, and coworkers  were nice. Company is very inclusive."
good,"Flexible but very corporate. There is a strong push to over sell both products and credit cards with no commission. This lead me to not care as much but still left a strong pressure that made it more uncomfortable than anything. Selling is good but their were often times they wanted me to sell more than what the customer needed and wanted and used our credit cards to make it ""affordable"". "
good,Best Buy was a great starter job with many positions. Only downfall was that they did not want to off full time. They have a great discount on most products in store.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best Buy is a super fun place to work at! You are always moving around departments. The people are very friendly. The only downside is you sometimes work with a lot of unintelligent people. Some of the supervisors/managers should not be in a management position because of their intelligence and lack of professionalism. If you come to Best Buy hoping for an advancement in some positions you might have to accept that fact that it will take a while.
good,Most days were slow and mostly spent talking to customers about products. The worst part had to be the amount of branded payments and revenue per hour we has to meet.
good,"I worked in Asset Protection. It wasn't a physically demanding job but you still had plenty to do to keep you busy. The supervisor was pretty straight forward and didn't sugar coat things. They were fair with hours to the part timers and OT if and when it was available. If there was a full time position in my department, I wouldn't have looked for other employment."
good,Great job as a beginning job for a teen age individual. Learn the basics of customer service and satisfaction and find ways to improve those skills in your own unique way.
good,"Great place to 'start' a career.  Pay doesn't match the knowledge required to be successful. Environment is among the cleanest and co-workers are great for the most part... competitive, but great."
good,great to work for... little room to move up.. but the team environment is amazing and the culture is praised by leadership... always fun and really decent money
good,I had a good grasp of the job and had great boss. the only issues were that everyone was real quick to take customers from you. I was seasonal and would have stayed at the one i was at if the other reps didn't take customers away from me while i was helping them.
good,Had a great learning experience. Helped benefit me in my personal and professional life. Worked with so many great people and had so much fun working there.
good,Working there for 2 years had its perks great discounts and lots of great technology. Definitely a place to do research. The crew was fun to work with.
good,great coworkers I truly believe the location and the management is a little different than most people expect but it's efficient. If I could work for them again for a season I would love to.
good,Enjoy working for this company because of the people I have met and the experience it has given me as a first paid job. Hours are flexible to what you tell yourself you can work.
good,"Working here you would repair computers and support clients face-to-face. The culture of the Geek Squad was all encompassing and robust.Because of the culture, the job was made fun. Management was subpar in most dealings and would typically never lead any of the teams in general."
good,"It was fun working there, but I couldn't make a living off of it. Great for a first time job for someone attending college or school.You'll learn a lot about current and upcoming tech. Plus companies like Samsung and Windows constantly have added discounts and rewards for learning about their products."
good,"I was hired to work over Christmas. I worked through mid January and I like it.  The conflict that I ran into is that although I requested to work weeknights, because I do freelance photography  on weekends, they were not able to accommodate my request. And so after the holiday I did not stay. Nor was I asked to stay."
good,"Have to know someone to get hired"
good,"For me this was a great place to start in the IT industry.  I was hired on as a part-time employee as a Consulting Agent.  This position has limited troubleshooting and is focused more on sales than PC fixes.  Stress levels can get high, especially when 8 to 10 people come in for issues.  The booking slots are 20 minutes long and you will use just about every minute of it if you are doing you job correctly.  (Math time 10 X 20 is 200 minutes or 3.3 hours for possible wait-times if you are the only CA on duty.)  Clients can be a little testy, especially if they are in that last half of the group.  Challenging to overcome from time to time.  Fortunately the ARA's do come out and help put people in the scheduler and do their best to help with the line.  But this does cut into the service tickets-closed part of the job criteria.  :("
good,"It was a really easy job that didn't really start for a while, so in the mean time we just walked around cleaning. It was fun because it wasn't a rushed type feeling while working. Just took our time and we got the job done without the managers over our shoulders every 5 minutes."
good,"It was a good place to work. I truly loved the employees they became like family (if a dysfunctional one) but the job culture seemed that only a select few were able to advance. There seemed to be a boys club. I was one of the best selling associates and I was treated like a second class citizen by the management for the majority of my time there. Still, even then I befriended almost all of them and don't take think anything ill of them at all. We all worked well and things were able to resolve even if there were problems overall I loved this job even with all its flaws."
good,It was super easy going. A lot of fun people made for a good work environment. Hours were good during holiday season but dwindled off afterwards. Management was usually pretty good and my sales supervisor helped me out a lot with hours
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I was only a reasonable employee so I did not get to see the usual non holiday hours, but from what I saw and comparing to my current job, bestbuy was much more strict. We would only get 30 minute breaks for an 8 hour shift and I constantly worked past what my shift was supposed to be. The best part of the job was the people I met."
good,Best Buy is a fun fast paced environment.  What makes this job difficult is the constant nagging from management regardless of how well you are doing and the lack of appreciation
good,This was a seasonal job so I don't know a lot of what benefits a regular employee is offered.  The people I worked with were very pleasant and seemed happy.
good,"While i enjoyed my time working there work / life balance was disastrous and was even harder if you had children. my direct manager was great, but the supervisor I had at the time was not and although issues were brought up about that situation nothing was ever done"
good,"If this is your first job or you're coming out of an old job, this is a great place to start. You make a lot of connections and meet plenty of interesting people."
good,"Fun atmosphere, fast paced, room to grow. Great retail job overall. Learned a lot, fast paced, engaged critical thinking. Great employee benefits and competitive pay"
good,Great place to start out and there are opportunities to advance. Can have some really good coworkers and managers. Schedule can be somewhat random sometimes but if you go full time it can get better
good,"Great place to get started. You meet a lot of people, and work with a lot of people. There are many different departments you can work with and many things you can learn."
good,Productive and fun place to work especially if you are a student. There is always room for advancement and for you to learn a new role.Great learning tools you can use to your advantage.Overall a good experience and good people.
good,"I had a pretty good experience working for best buy mobile. I worked in stand alone stores. Was enjoyable for what it was, due to the store culture set by management."
good,Great atmosphere and fun place to work. The pay is not great but the discounts make up for it. Tons of things to learn from the elearning. You can make good money as you move up in the company.
good,I enjoyed everyone I worked with in the computer department. They were kind and helpful. They were also very patient and encouraging as I learned the job
good,"I did everything that was required of me during my tenureship at Best Buy. That's the statement I was given by my former manager. However, he then said my own section was completely out of hours to give new employees."
good,As with most jobs it really depends on management.  Went from 4.5 stars to 2.5 stars with new GM and Sr. Management. Good discounts.  working through the Holidays is tough though.
good,Enjoyed the job. Hated leaving due to school enrollment. They said they has to let me go due to season ending and my commitment to school interfered  with work hours
good,its unrealistic to achieve all they asked for such as asking for upgrades or pressuring customers into getting something i did not believe in or saw a benefit to.
good,Best Buy is a great place to work if your into selling items to customers. There was always a new challenge everyday when you walked into a store but that's what the supervisors or managers were paid to fix.
good,At the time that I had worked at Best Buy I was able to obtain a great sense of salesmanship and customer service. The outside sales division has since been dissolved.
good,"Great place to learn about electronics and team developing skills."
good,"Not a bad work environment and easy/fun work with technology. Management and ethics were not the best but as for a retail environment, it's as ethical as you would expect."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I would prefer not to comment.  They have treated me well.  I have no issues with them but it is time to move on.  I wish them all the best after I depart the company.
good,"Extremely competitive environment, the overall feeling of the place is extremely fast paced and requires you to stay on your toes with training and overall tech experience."
good,This job is a piece of cake very easy and you love what you do. The only problem is that you don't make much money and only part time. Great team building.
good,"Place to work if you're in school,  just starting a career, part time/seasonal work, or just needing a 2nd job.  Most of the time scheduling is flexible with the exception of holiday season."
good,Best Buy is a pretty good place to work for if you like electronics and learning about all the new stuff that comes out and helping sell it to the consumers. They have a pretty fair work environment as well.
good,"Pretty ok place to work. There are some things that yo uhave to get used to but it's not that hard.Depending on your store, you might have to dela with a bit of favoritism depending on hte manager or the supervisor that you may have."
good,"on  a typical day I would help guest in the store."
good,Have alot of fun working at Best Buy. Great environment for techy kind of people. Can get along with anybody there. Customers as well as employees and some management offer for a great fun sales experience.
good,"Best buy is a fun place to work at. Ive learned how to correctly stock inventory in the store, effectively help customers in need and built teammate skills with my fellow employees. The workplace culture was pretty good and the management treated their employees well."
good,"Good first job environment. It is a pretty standard retail experience. The hardest part of the job is definitely pleasing those customers who are irritated, but that is to be expected when you are selling laptops to people who have just had their computers crash. Work environment is great; Managers are awesome and look out for their employees and are eager to see you move up in the company. Would recommend working here to anyone looking to make a good wage in a fun and relaxing, yet hard working environment."
good,"If you are looking to make a career out of working for Best Buy your outlook may be different than mine. I only worked at Best Buy so I could earn income while going to school and all the managers know thats what a lot of employees do. Therefore they are extremely flexible with their scheduling to accommodate that. Good job if your only looking for employment like 2-4 years, anything beyond that I can't really say."
good,Work 8.5 hour shifts with one break
good,"The culture is very relaxed and comfortable (#763). "
good,Working for this company was a pleasure through and through. It has an amazing training staff who knows what they are doing to get you where you wanna be.
good,A professional and welcoming environment. Great incentives to keep everyone motivated to reach their goals. Flexible and considerate of availability with part employees
good,"Best Buy is great company to work for, if you are a young professional looking for sales experience. Work hours can be tricky at certain points. Advancement is hard to come by."
good,It was a very interesting place to work at. The management changed and my hours got messed up. I was having medical issues at the time and this conflicted with my work schedule.
good,I have to say if you want to know about the latest gadgets then this is the place to work.  Also the discounts can't be beat.  The learning experience was good and they train you well.
good,The environment is relaxed sometimes and people are fun to work with and the work place is very motivating to work hard.  The down side of the company is the customers.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best buy compensates their employees well but job security is absolute. I went through multiple store closings during my span of 3 years working at best buy and they do not place you in another location.
good,"Learned a lot about electronics and how to adhere to everyone's needs by finding the right product for them. The management could've been better, but great coworkers who helped each other out often in order to reach all sale goals for the day/month. Wage could've been better. One of those retail places that everyone must experience at some point in order to gain the right interpersonal skills!"
good,"I am not going to give a review essay, just filling in the required 150 char minimum. It's a job, you work, you get paid. Nothing else is needed or required"
good,"I was hired as a seasonal sales associate in the Home Solutions department. My main role in the team was to sell televisions, but I also connected with customers, listened and tried to troubleshoot their problems, and in general bring them up to date with the rapidly-changing tech industry."
good,"Working with Geek Squad is great. Working together with like-minded people towards a common goal. Also, its great to share knowledge with one another."
good,Co workers are awesome scope of work is amazing but pay and management is bad. The push for selling services is too much for a job that should be more oriented towards fixing computers.
good,"Best Buy was an overall good place to work. The issues are really around the Holiday times when you would have to do things, such as, work on Thanksgiving. However, the time does go by quick. Depending on your location and how helpful your managers are is dependent on your career advancement."
good,"After 12+ years working in various departments, i have to say it was not a horrible experience. I learned a lot, and grew a lot. Prioritizing and multi-tasking is absolutely imperative. There are high stress days and not a lot of support, as staff was continually stretched thin."
good,"people were good to work with , they teach you a decent amount knowledge on the product , most of the time you gonna have to take the time to learn everything else if you wanna excel ."
good,"Fast paced environment that challenges all the employees in their knowledge of products.  Employees are given 2 hours a month to train up on products in their department and good to know as well.  This will help you hit your sales targets and show customers something ""cool"" about what this new stuff can do.  My favorite part of the job is related to that.  When I see someone's eyes light up and they say... ""WOW this can do all that?"". Always a highlight for me. :)"
good,"They say they will work with you on things and then turn around and do the opposite. You ask for more hours, so they cut them. You tell them you'd like to move up in the company and they stick you in a corner. If you're one of managements ""pets"", however, you'll go far."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to learn about technology. There are multiple online learning tests that employees are required to take on a monthly basis. The Sales environment is really competitive but always feels ""forced"" by management and the pressure is always on."
good,"great place to work. "
good,Best Buy was a great experience and if I could go back I would. It helped me become a better salesman and work hard to get what I want. It also made me the man that I am today
good,"as a seasonal employees, the regular full time/ part time employees were not too helpful and inviting. This is true at the location I worked in, even the managers were stand offish. Somewhat unprofessional."
good,"I don't have any comments. I don't have anything to say really about the company. If you love electronics then go work there. If you are looking for your first job, then go apply."
good,"It was a good job but didn't pay well enough. Management was very fair and the jobs i had while under their employment were fairly easy. Just required a little bit of studying so you would have the information in order to sell, but that's always a given in sales."
good,"A great place to work if you can deal with the retail world. Work/Life balance got pretty crazy when you are at the supervisor or above level. I enjoyed my teams, and the time I got to invest in the people the most about best buy."
good,I was a sales associate for Best Buy Mobile. The job is fast paced and requires a lot of knowledge about products and companies but can be rewarding and a great experience for people who want to develop sales skills. I was just unfortunate enough to get a poor manager.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The company is great for a fast paced work environment great at establishing the basic sales skills wanted in many employees. The workplace culture is centered on service with efficiency and being knowledgeable.
good,Best buy was a good place to work at. I got paid 10 dollars an hour and hand enough hours. They are flexible about hours and asking for time off. My only issue was getting time off for holidays. They are very strict about it. Over all I would recommend working at best buy
good,"Hardest part of working for this company is the work/life balance, The company cares a lot about the customers, if only they put that much time and effort into the people that put in the hard work, sweat and tears."
good,"Okay, overall Best Buy isnt bad, if you can handle the stress that comes with the holiday season. Long hours, weird shift, opening at 7am or closing at 11pm"
good,fast paced work environment . good place to work if you like to be busy long hours on your feet but well worth the workout. during the holiday rush things can got a little crazy.
good,Sometimes hard work goes unnoticed but other than that it's a fun place to work and the culture it is a fun workplace. Management is easy going as long as you do your job
good,I wish I was younger cuz they see the gray hair but worked as hard ...maybe not as fast as the young ones there to land a permanent job with the Best BUy company.
good,"I think media is the best department to work for. Getting to play new video games to ""demo"" and sell electronics with the ever changing world. Management was freaking awesome! Super nice guys, all of them! 99% of all employees were outside work friends at some point. Hardest part was trying to get enough hours to make a living outside of management but the most enjoyable was staff and friendly environment."
good,"▪When you work at Best Buy you become very close to your colleagues (in every department), it makes you feel like you are part of a family. "
good,"Regardless of heavy sales goals and need to add services to every transaction, this is a great place to work. Most days are very fun and enjoyable if you find technology interesting. Having conversations with customers is often difficult due to high pressure sales environment, but training is available."
good,"Best Buy is a good place to work if you're going to school on the side, or you just need a temporary job to start making money right away. Working at Best Buy as career would be a bad choice, because it is hard to move from entry level positions into management, and if you're lucky enough to get promoted to manager, you won't be seeing your family very often. The money isn't worth it, and ripping off customers on OVER-marked up accessories gets old. I would recommend doing something that contributes more to society. Not a corporation that only worries about sales and not people."
good,I thought it was an OK position. They push the credit cards way too hard but it is an alright entry level sales position. I need to add more characters so it will let me post.
good,"Fast paced, handle one hundred or more customers per shift with simple things such as mobile accessories to more in depth tasks such as give them the complete mobile solution for their lifestyle."
good,"At work at Best Buy, there is never a dull moment as you are expected to work and do something, if there is nothing to do, you are expected to find something to do and keep busy, either selling something or helping a customer on the sales floor. Management varies and some can be helpful when you are busy, while some will not help. The hardest part is keeping the customers happy while also keeping the management happy. The most enjoyable part of the job is the small discounts that come with the job."
good,"If you work hard you can advance. Because retail has mostly gone to online ordering, it is a much harder job.  If you like electronics, it's easy to stay updated on all the new products."
good,"Its a great entry level sales position, staff and management were pleasant to work with, would work with them again if i had the opportunity to again."
good,Nice showroom setup for different departments — security at entrance at all times — associates clean work areas and check for shrink —� use forklift to retrieve or store merchandise.
good,"Good part time job for a student, not too stressful and offers flexible hours. Also offers good discounts on merchandise. A great place to learn customer service skills."
good,"Great Tech Retail company. Would recommend to anyone interested in entry level retail. Emphasis on entry level retail. If you are not interested in management, you wont get too much more than a few dollars above minimum wage. Even skilled trades such as installation technicians who are certified don't make competitive wages."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"over all the job was great, i only left for what was at the time a better opportunity."
good,"Good place to work with all the benefits one could ask from a full-time job.  Co-workers are always willing to give a helping hand or answer a question quick question.  A ""One Team, One Dream"" philosophy. You will always be up to date wit the latest and greatest when it comes to technology."
good,Cool break room with TV and dartboard. Great motivated management staff. Discounts off products. Relaxed work environment. Fun to talk to all kinds of people and help them find the right product.
good,"Learned a lot as a cashier but wish we were able to train in other departments, you were set in whatever department you were in and not really trained in any other areas. Fun and relaxing except for busy season."
good,The people of best buy (including management) were some of the most helpful and nicest I've ever met. Typically the day started with the stocking of the shelves and general morning meetings. I learned that Good customer relations here can help in almost any situation even if you do not know much about what you are selling.
good,"As long as you don't mind the low pay/benefits and politics you can't get away from. Best Buy (GeekSquad) is a great place to work."
good,"Bad stint with no direct leadership. Gm was injured in a car wreck and my boss stepped up to help, have not had direct leadership since. Great culture and team, but it can be hard to get things done out side of my area without help from leadership."
good,"Fun place to work in, people are awesome, and the discounts are fantastic.  Learned a lot about electronics, especially those that are popular.  Learned a lot about games and digital stuff here.  No room for promotion, takes a very long time to get to senior."
good,The job culture was amazing and basically they really do stand out their logo. Have fun while being the best. One of the best buys id recommend because not only the employees were good but it was just amazing meet new people and interacting with customers.
good,Fast-pace working environment that helped me learn how to manage time in the most effective way. Worked in the ecommerce department and focused on packaging customers orders and shipping them out.
good,"One of the mottos for Best Buy was ""Have fun while being the best"". Everyone could be themselves while helping customers. In a close setting some departments had you learned a lot in other departments"
good,"Managing a team of professional contact center executives in a challenging and customer driven environment."
good,"Is a great place to work if you love retail. BBY offers the best benefits and discounts to employee than any other retail company."
good,It ok starter job. great benefits I just got too comfortable. its a definitely who you know atmosphere and could use some updating. The managers are are for the most part but can get too emotional than doing their job.
good,Best Buy is a fun and relaxed place to work at. It's perfect for a beginner's job and for those who are tech savvy with modern technology. It's easy going with great people. *Advice: Knowledge in products and services will make the job easier.
good,"I learned alot working at best buy you are the first one to try out the new toys that everyone wants to get there hands on, you learn alot from you mentors"
good,I worked there when the first moved to Canada and it was a fun place to work just wish then the pay was better. From top to bottom it was a great company.
good,"Typical day at work was to meet the required daily goals, which was micromanaged and tracked. It was stressful sometimes trying to meet the numbers came up with. The interaction with customers was very fulfilling."
good,"Best Buy can be a fun place to work, as long as you complete your tasks in a quick and efficient manner. Most managers and coworkers are friendly and are willing to help you out."
good,Fun workplace for the time I was there.  I enjoyed the Boston stores I worked in more than the oklahoma one.  The Oklahoma store needed better management and had a reputation for not being fair with their employees.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I learned alot at this job and it was a second home to me, I learned a vast knowledge of cars and the methods and procedures to installing aftermarket equipment. It was a fun place to work but also had challenges of more difficult cars and teaching yourself some things"
good,It’s a nice job everyone there has there own agenda on how things should be done it’s a cool environment to work they try to make it fun as much as possible
good,"Loved the place until customers ruined it for me. Other than that, work environment is great depending on who you work with. Day to day work can get tedious."
good,"It's a great place to start your career path, especially Geek Squad. The pay is decent for retail, and they offer full benefits for full time employees and limited benefits for part time. I gained quite a bit of relevant experience that helped me get my foot in the door to other places."
good,Une expérience enrichissante pour connaitre au mieux l'esprit du client québécois dans une  entreprise stable et agréable
good,"Depending on what you do, you can either be slow or busy. As a cashier, you are pressured to try to sign up as many people up for a credit card as possible. It was still a fun experience to work and see different electronics and entertainment that is coming out."
good,"This store was okay to work at.  The management, however, had no communications skills at all.  They never talked with each other.  This often lead to a lot of miscommunication and double work."
good,"Depending on your position Best Buy can be great, or stressful. Sales teams are rather laid back. Warehouse and inventory teams are laid back. Customer service and management are high stress at certain periods of time. Geek Squad positions are the best in the store, but only have a few spots, if any, and are hard to get into. The pay is ok for the work. Employees tend to be friendly and get along well with each other. I would recommend working at Best Buy."
good,Daily operations include dealing with money which I enjoy. Compensation was decent prior to receiving a degree. Schedule was suitable to my needs. No health insurance.
good,"No matter what your future goals are,  there is an avenue to grow and learn with this company - assuming you can look past the 18 year olds at the store level."
good,"Everything is good except for their lack of appreciation for part-time employees. As a part-time worker you won't get any benefits, even emergency absence/leave is counted against you."
good,"Best Buy as a job has good benefits like the employee discount, but its managers are not very organized.  Also the job culture is very competitive so it jeopardizes team work culture."
good,"I sell Apple Products and all brands of Computers. Once a Month Apple Meetings. "
good,"very friendly staff and a friendly atmosphere hygiene were proper as well employees and coworkers were very helpful. management was also proper, and no-one slacked at doing their work."
good,"El trabajo aqui, si se realiza correctamente y con responsabilidad se hace muy facil."
good,I quickly and accurately diagnose client technology issues using specialty software and make solution-based recommendations to our clients in a timely fashion.
good,It's silly that I have to provide a review of this employer.  I worked there for a couple years while in college and it has been 12 years since my experience.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,After working with the company for 2 years I can say that this is a great company to work for. Lots of great benefits and perks. I would go back in a heartbeat.
good,I enjoyed working at Best Buy. It was a beginner job in high school and it was perfect. Very young crowd and people get along very well. Great discounts as well.
good,"A great Work Place for driven people. Opportunity to increase customer service and management skills. If you are looking to advance (relatively quickly), its not the place for you. Otherwise great ethics."
good,"On a single day, you could be helping clients with questions regarding TV's to helping them decide their wife's birthday present. Out of the ten years ive worked for this company, ive learned communications skills, leadership, to come up with solutions quickly when problems rise. "
good,Day to day getting sales goals that were way too high for the traffic we had in the store. Most of my co-workers were always in a bad mood even when I tried to always do what i could to help them.
good,"I enjoyed working at Best Buy, and the people were all very nice an accepting. Yet the management was very laid back and observant of everyones movement, great startter job, but monotonous"
good,Typical work day was spent at the register. I enjoyed customer interactions and signing up individuals for credit cards based on needs. Being able to finance really  helps with sales. Hardest part of the day may be dealing with price changes or overrides since managers tend to be busy somewhere throughout the store so you have to wait patiently with the customer.
good,"The typical day at Best Buy is working with customers all day and helping them in their needs for purchases or questions they may need. There can always be something new to learn depending on the customer. I do work with a lot of a younger generation of which can keep me young and active. The hardest part I think at the moment for me is at this job may be, standing all day long, I want the opportunity to have the option in a job where I can sit and stand when needed. And the most enjoyable part for me is, talking to new people everyday and training all the new employees coming in to work for Best Buy."
good,"Great work life balance, company leadership is top notch!  Great start up salary for Account manager position but needs improvement on the commission structure for new hires."
good,"Fast moving company, and that sure makes the day go by fast, and that is what I sure like. The electronics world is a great one for sure, and this company sure does follow it, and they do a good job at it."
good,I got along great with all of my co-workers. During our breaks we were allowed to play video games in the break room so that we would be current on what games were trending.
good,"Of course each location is different. The store in which I work for is strapped for labor. The company tries to pull every ounce of work they can get out of you during your time there. Example: Inventory and Merch positions are literally timed for every single job that they do. The sales floor is run like they are on commission, only without the commission pay. This current location is more focused on what you are doing wrong, rather than what you are doing right. You better have thick skin."
good,Great place to work. Good benefits and competitive pay. Nice discount on fun stuff. Almost feels like a barter system working there for the cool stuff they sell.
good,"Working at Best Buy is truly an experience that can be whatever an individual chooses to make of it by the efforts and talents they put in. Over the past 5 years, I have been fortunate to move ahead with the company in meaningful ways, learn new skills, and discover new strengths about myself."
good,Best Buy is a great company for people who love technology. They are a fun place to work. It is great for a first job. You make a lot of friends. I have had these friends for over 20 years now. This was a great time.
good,"A typical day is spent answer and directing calls on a multi line phone system, scheduling appointments, answering customer questions, and dealing with upset customers. I have learned how to better problem solve and have more patience. The work place culture is relatively laid back. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to constantly learn about the latest technology."
good,"Supervising, training, coaching, selling, promoting credit, offering in home services for TV's and PC's, matching associates with customers, exit interviews and managing reports."
good,"As an inventory specialist, your role was to process daily shipments, maintain stock on the floor, carry products in/out of customers vehicles, and lastly, unload truck twice a week. The management was good throughout most of my time there, but it went south towards the end of employment there. The hardest part of the job is usually the most stressful time of the year, which is the holiday season."
good,Provided remote assistance for those not so tech savy having computing issues. Requires extreme patience. Enjoyed the reaction when problems were resolved for the clients. Can be mentally draining.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"nothing too bad honestly, great place to work, always room to grow, easy work, decent pay but can move up, amazing discount, training is good, crazy hours if your overnight though"
good,The environment was workplace friendly and made things easier to work around. Friendly associates and understanding management. Would work here again in the future.
good,"Best Buy has by far been the best place I have worked at. When I first started working here, the atmosphere was very welcoming and it started feeling like a family. This place has shown me how to grow as a better person and how to be more independent."
good,Working for best buy was great. i built a lot of relationships and met a lot of people.  I left to pursue high positions. There was not a lot of room to move up in Best Buy.
good,"I loved working at Best Buy but I found that you only got promoted if you were a favorite. I got turned down for quite a few positions because I did not have adequate experience even though I worked in that department. There are very few full time positions available but in all I think it is a GREAT first job. It gets you sales experience or retail experience to move up in the company, eventually, or on to bigger and better things."
good,"Best Buy is a high energy, active fun workplace. There is a lot of team building and a great sense of camaraderie. It is slow at times and then also very fast paced."
good,A workplace with excellent culture and goals. Focus on work/life balance and the employee experience. High degree of professionalism and customer service.
good,"I Loved the placed were I worked. But, after a while the placed no longer became a place to have fun and work. It was about how much money can you ca bring in at the cost of the customers."
good,"Great work environment. love the discount and the bonus structure. The base pay and opportunities for advancement could be better. The computers and equipment in my department need an upgrade. interesting how the mobile department has the highest profit margin for the company, yet we at the last to receive updated equipment...."
good,Not a bad place to work at all if your management is good. When I originally started there was a strong team of managers that made it a fun workplace environment. However over the course of the time I've worked here it seems to be getting worse and worse and the management is the biggest issue. They need to recognize the good employees from the bad ones instead of looking at numbers as a whole. I find myself attending several underperformance meetings due to other people not doing there job.
good,"spent most of the day on feet, little opportunity to sit"
good,Friendly place to work. Management is equally as friendly and likes to add fun things to do during the year as a store. Work is fast paced depending on the market area your in the faster the pace the faster the day goes by. If you love technology you will learn a lot of valuable information and your working directly with what you enjoy. Overall its a good company with room for advancement.
good,"I really enjoy working at Best Buy. Our store is a pretty small store, so there may be difficulties that occur at larger stores, but at mine the people are very nice and welcoming."
good,"Travail surtout de service à la clientèle, ventes de produits électronique et de services. Vente plan de protection."
good,Over all a great place to work. Team atmosphere and always learning something new with technology. Big on training. They have classroom style training as well as a lot of E-Learnings employees can take on line.
good,"best buy is an easy place to work at, the management can be good depending on which location you work at but its not too bad. hours are mostly flexible and negotiable and there are a lot of good people that work there"
good,"I've been with the company for five months. I got hired at the PRC in Chino as a shipping associate, (GWW) which means I would work using a reach truck and electric pallet jack.  Unlike working at Home Depot and Target's RDC's I had to wait five full months until I finally was assigned someone to certify me."
good,It is a fun place to work at. Just have to do your job and provide good customer services. Everything else will fall into place. Just be respectful and on time.
good,"Good place to work overall. My only complaint, like most jobs, you need to butt kiss to advance. Best Discount in retail. Working Part time at best buy was great."
good,"it is a retail business were they focused on selling extra coverage, there credit card and customer experience. the management is give and take they have some really good ones and than some that are just there for a paycheck. and the coworkers and 50/50 when it comes to helping out or just doing their job. the ones that help out though tend to be good people and easy to get along with."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Overall a good place to start if your interested in the retail side of business. Friendly staff members and good management will make the days fly by quick.
good,"Owner started from nothing and grew into a multi-million dollar business. Make sure cars were clean in the showroom, knowing the used car inventory and prices. Keep up[ to date on all new products being offered. Long hours at times. The cold weather was ruff when cleaning snow off of cars. I enjoyed being to get the customer that car that would fit their needs and also their dreams."
good,"Typical day consists of setting up the store for the day, making sales and learning about products. When there are no sales being processed you are required to stand on the lease line and bring in potential customers. Product ambassadors would visit frequently with new products to demonstrate for the store and lots of goodies for us to take home. My manager was a great guy, funny, very supportive, and gave constructive criticism when needed. I learned a lot during my time at Best Buy Mobile and would definitely recommend it to anyone."
good,"Worked as a sales consultant.  I loved the coworkers that I had and I loved the environment.  Sales can get old, especially after the holidays, but BestBuy does some nice things to appreciate their workers."
good,"I took this job to stay current with technology in the home market. A market that expanded many times over in the last few years with the core being social media. I was a little dis-appointed that the technical part of the job was not a position of gaining insight but a repetitious running of canned procedures. But with Best buy's profit margins, hiring very entry level people seems the only way they can give this service . So it works for them. I loved the management and how they treated me.."
good,Great starting pay for someone starting out in the job field. management has open door policy so you feel like your heard when you have a concern. Good for developing skills in both management and sales.
good,This was a great company to work for I got to travel to Portland and the pay was fair the employees and managers are awesome the only con is it is tough to get a full time position
good,"Not to say I didn't enjoy my time with the company buy I do feel that the job is not long term. With the lack of job security and low wages, there was no room to really grow."
good,"I was only working part time. I showed up everyday for the 7 months I worked there. It kept me busy and I got along well with the staff."
good,Great work environment . Very flexible with hours. Tons of benefits. Management is very hands on. Holiday season is the absolute best. You'll always have something to do.
good,". Very fun work place and great discounts"
good,Supportspace.com was fairly decent company. Everything was remotely done so I never met my supervisors or my customers in person. Pay was good. Company lost contract with GeekSquad.
good,"Typical Job, lots of expectations and not enough training. I liked working there, the pay was ok, but even for a Lead sales, I wasn't making very much."
good,"I worked with best buy for a little over a year, and enjoyed the experience. The only issues I had were with management, as they had the final say in everything. It was clear that advancement was not based upon merit, but instead based upon who liked you."
good,I again do not want to write a review. I do not understand why it even attempts to force me. Why can I not simply check a box to avoid it. Instead I am now wasting everyone's time.
good,Best Buy was a great experience and company. Upper management struggled with building rapport with GMs and lack of development which caused high turnover in the district. A lot of things were promised but wasn't delivered.
good,Fun place to work. Great people. Not great pay or benefits. Mediocre pay even at management level for what they expect of you. People get promoted just due to being around forever.
good,"Best Buy was a chill company to work for. Management can sometimes be caught up in there work, but they will always be there to help. It was definitely a chill environment"
good,"If you're looking to move away from fast food, and mindless sales, Best Buy is the place for you.many benefits for their employees; friendly staff, and lots of learning and personal growth opportunity."
good,"I have been with Geek Squad for about 2 years. I have learned to love the culture and have learned several new methods through the years to repair, test and resolve issues. While the culture and people are great, the compensation and requested skill set tend to be too low and too high. While it is one of the highest paying retail positions, with the change to minimal wage and the increased cost of education the job can be financial frustrating"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I loved working at Best Buy until they stopped out bonuses (which were department based and not just handed out), and when the management changed. Each department had its own manager and supervisor and we were treated fairly as employees, where managers both critiqued and applauded us for our work. After the management changed, managers were often in the office, and getting overrides/ asking questions was very difficult. Employees who worked hard received just as much credit (and pay, sometimes more) than the employees who didn't care, so the work ethic of the store decreased. The whole Best Buy business model also sucks because there's no incentive to work hard."
good,"I decidedly did enjoy my time working with this company. For the type of work it generally entails it was well compensated for, except for behind the curtain in the area of computer repairs."
good,"For a retail position Best Buy is a very nice place to work especially once you establish yourself as a specialist, lead, or geek squad. A generally very fun and support team rather then a competitive one where many geeks and blue shirts willing to aid one another. Very clear daily and monthly goals and objectives with a generally accommodating schedule outside of numerous emergencies or call offs. As a geek, the pay was good but unfortunately the ability to advance was much more restricted since geeks are a more permanent position on the level of leads."
good,Best Buy was a good company for me to work at while I was going to school.  If a person is looking for a place to work while they are going to school this would be a good company to work for.
good,Managing a large store such as this one is not simple.  You have to be sharp and on your feet monitoring production on all levels and making sure all your vendors are paid on time
good,"one of my first Jobs, working at Best Buy was very fun. if you are good at Sales and are good with people than this is the place for you. very friendly people and a good work environment."
good,"Best Buy is an awesome part-time job and if it weren't for being in college, I would have loved to stay. Though I set a limit to my hours, I was still being given too many which hindered my school work. "
good,"I enjoyed working for this company due to the friendly and safe working environment. Good, approachable  management made this job a great learning experience and I made many friends with co-workers. I would defiantly work for this company again."
good,With friendly staff and co workers I can easily recommend Best Buy to anyone looking for a job associated with electronics. work is easy and manageable and provides constant learning opportunities
good,There's always something new to learn and teach others. Each customer interaction stretches your knowledge base to help find the best solution each time.
good,"The job is straight forward and a great start to working in the IT field."
good,"Busy energetic work environment, be proactive, listen to what the problem is and what the customer is requiring. Teamwork, communication is a must. "
good,excellent place to work in the city.  i enjoyed working there under best management/supervisors and i i learnt alot from them. thank for giving me such opportunity which is life learning experience.
good,"A typical day included reviewing any open facility repair requests, any open bids for repair requests.  I also made any capital funding requests that come from the bids for the needed repairs."
good,"Good place to build skills for a career, and to advance if that is your intention. Competitive pay once you get into a leadership position. Your experience as an employee, I would say, is about 80% reliant on which store you work at."
good,"Some of the best working hours I've ever put in were at Best Buy. It felt open and free flow on the sales floor, though more monotonous and constrained for security. Both jobs were good and I enjoyed the environment."
good,I worked fr Best Buy and would still today. Good company. I started in car audio and moved into management. A difference in opinion was the reason I left.
good,"Amazing team. Everyone was super helpful to new and old employees both. Great learning experience. Very friendly environment. I learned a lot there and really enjoyed the experience, and found that I quite enjoy working in a warehouse environment."
good,Great company to work for. Treats employees well. Has great benefits and incentives to meet your sales goals. Great team to be apart of. Great advancement opportunities.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Depending on which department you join, your day can vary from pricing, cleaning, and maintaining store displays to processing customer returns. You have the opportunity to learn just about anything in regards to customer service skills, technical information, and Best Buy practices. The culture definitely varies depending on the District leadership as well as store management. "
good,"Worked with good people in my department as in store PC geek squad. Pay was good, no benefits for part time, and full time positions were basically non-existent. Whether or not you got lunch or regular breaks depended totally on how busy it was."
good,"Customer satisfaction is something I love and as long as the customer is happy, I'm happy. Management has their good days and bad days. Sometimes i feel when we don't reach goals and percentages for the month they forget we're human and if we do reach our goals everyone has a good day. Sometimes working the shifts can take a toll because they make you feel mandated to stay after your shift if needed. I take it up as retail but sometimes it can take a huge toll."
good,I enjoyed working here. It was my first job.  I learned a lot about electronics and being able to play with all the new electronics was a plus!
good,"Ive heard horror stories of Geek Squad, however I truly believe it depends on your manager. Our Geek Squad manager is amazing but some of the other managers in the store, not so much."
good,I enjoyed my time there as a seasonal in Home Theatre. I got the opportunity to learn a lot about products I was unfamiliar with. I was able to learn and utilize my new information on products with customers as well discussing them with employees.
good,During my time at Best Buy they gave me great opportunities. Taught me a lot about myself. The management really pushed me to success by giving me all of the tools that I needed.
good,"Lots of music, exciting video, cellular, and other sophisticated technology all around all the time. A great and fun work experience."
good,"Wonderful work atmosphere as well as excellent training."
good,"A typical day at work would be to drive the production of the building to maximize units per hour (UPH) and strive to ensure that our customers (our stores) were setup for success."
good,Best Buy was always a solid company to work for even when they were going through rough times. Management was always at least decent and the atmosphere was good. The only downside would be the pay but that comes with a starter job. You do get good discounts though.
good,i truly enjoy working here although everything becomes too repetitive. most people come in with the same issue with is software related  ( corrupted os or virus). its hard to keep the mind stimulated becasue things become less challenging
good,"Overall a good work environment. You will learn a lot about the nature of the business and the home theater needs of customers. In addition, you'll calibrate with company vendors that will guide you on the latest and greatest of the product lines from companies such as Sony, Samsung and LG and so forth."
good,"A good company that takes the effort in training their employees to ensure their customers get the best experience possible. "
good,"A day in the life of a Best Buy employee was decent. I had prior been in the department of Customer Service and loved my daily duties and assisting customers with products and services. Through my employment with the company I had been promptly moved to the Sales floor and the envoirnment quickly changed. I can't say if it had been the management or the co-workers, but the feeling of stability and the foundation I had built changed and no longer enjoyed the work. I had daily sales goals and quotas to meet and I exceeded with the sales on a good busy day. It was fun."
good,"A good company to work for and if you make nice with the right people, you can move up too. Many restructures. Shows the company is evolving."
good,"Typical work day would start about 7:30am with pre calls to that days scheduled clients. There would usually be 2 in the am and 2 in the pm, but that wasn't always the case. Due to the area we covered, drive times could be anywhere from right around the corner to a hour or more away. Often, there were times when we would have to work late to complete a job a client was unwilling to have us come back to, or because of unforeseen issues with a given install."
good,"i liked my manager of my department, but the group commission structure and low hours made it difficult to maintain a life style."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I enjoy my job the people I work with are nice.The discount is nice but I feel like unless you are friends with the GM your advancement is pretty nonresistant. Black Friday isn't bad it's having to work on Thanksgiving which is a pain.
good,Management are very accommodating. Employees feel that they are treated fairly and feel that they have a voice. The culture is very friendly. Most employees feel like their co-workers are family.
good,Excellent priority on Holiday season events and execution. Great veteran team and best in class creative content. Continuous development on operational processes.
good,"Best Buy is an excellent company to work for. You get to experience all aspects of jobs, customer service, sales, multi channel, logistics and more. Very fair when it comes to employees and their availability when it comes to school and other priorities."
good,"Amazing place to work and have fun at the same time with committed work culture, a relaxed atmosphere. provide a good sense of security,training and a mix of culture and diversity. ability to thrive and learn capable skills also the flexibility of working in any department you qualified for,"
good,great starter job. very good at learning the basics. great for technology . would have stayed if my store didn't close. make sure you learn quick or no promotion
good,"Fun place to work, little room for advancement. Good pay for a retail job. Also you have a black out period from November to January where you can't ask off due to holiday hours."
good,Fantastic place to work. Kind individuals and overall great work environment. Very easy to understand culture and easy work flow.
good,Still a boys club and very difficult for a woman with little respect or management opportunities. Focus is not really on customer service as I see it. More about the end sale and not necessarily what the customer really wants or needs!
good,"Typical day involved revieiwing sales goals/progress, approaching and interacting with customers proactively, and ensuring an orderly and well-stocked shopping area."
good,"Belle équipe, bel environnement! Formation complète et très utile et la sécurité avant tout!"
good,It was a very fast paced but enjoyable job. I worked in home theater and together with the home theater staff it was very easy to reach department goals.
good,Working with technology is fun and interesting. Always learning about new products. Lots of hands on with new tech. Helping customers can be enjoyable sometimes.
good,Best Buy is a place where you can start to build a healthy relationship between your peers. Internally you have multiple options to move forward in the company.
good,"Great people to work with and great work environment. Trainers provide excellent training and are very knowledgeable, overall good company to work for."
good,"Well its not too bad working there ."
good,"Retail is retail and in this job, the employee culture is key. The opportunity to move up in solely based on your commitment to do the job and how often a spot is open. Since there is not a whole lot of upward growth, you may be waiting some time before a spot is open, but when it does, it can be attained."
good,"A typical day at Best Buy would be for me to clock in and check out customers. As I would check out customers I had to inform them on the additional warranties on products, and return policies."
good,"I believe best buy is a good company, but some stores (Best Buy Gateway DR) are under poor management. Inventory especially because the workers in this department get over looked. Hardest part was working through obstacles When things would break or malfunction. The most enjoyable part was meeting good people."
good,best place to work in retail   great work environment    get to help people pick out the latest in technology which is very rewarding. They do have sti bonuses monthly for hitting targets which a lot of hourly retail jobs do not.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I learned a lot about shipping and receiving packages, my co-workers in the warehouse were very friendly, The associates on the sales floor kept to themselves and other floor associates. The hardest part of the job was sometimes put up stock (over the range microwaves, large printers). The most enjoyable part of the job was working with co-workers in the warehouse."
good,"There's never enough time at Best Buy. We are given far too many objectives with not enough time to complete tasks.  It's a retail environment so the pressure is expected, but the company seeks to continually grow without the proper time to coach & train. The co-workers is what makes the job great. Loss of good leadership in the past 8 years is what has caused a decline in terms of culture.  I definitely learned a lot from Best Buy and feel like I grew as a leader throughout my time."
good,I loved working for Best Buy. It was a fun atmosphere working with electronics and helping customers get what they need. I met a lot of good people there as well.
good,"It is sometimes hard to find support in the mobile department due to the complex transactions. Whenever a situation is needed where you need to call for help from management, they are not trained to know mobile activations. Other than that, the employees are really nice and you have a lot of fun."
good,Great place to work. I was always sharing my knowledge of computers and various electronics leaving customers satisfied. I had to quit because of a serious accident I suffered that was life threatening.
good,"Best Buy has faced many changed throughout the past 5 years; some for the better and some for the worse. Overall I was very pleased with my career within this organization as I thrive in a very fast-paced, performance-drive environment."
good,"Buenas prestaciones. Buen ambiente laboral, jornadas justas, buen equilibrio entre la familia y el trabajo."
good,The job was ok for a start. The pay is not competitive. As a matter of a fact you won't make much (regardless of experience). The discount is the best part.
good,"Would show up, power on computers, check where the company numbers were at, set my daily goal, then opened the store. Great company. Rented text books for 79% off through Best Buy."
good,"its fun to work there but managment is allways on your back, day in day out, the starting pay is nice but considering hpow much we do in the store it dose not translate well."
good,"Loved the fast pace work as a supervisor of the operations and product processing departments. "
good,"Overall, Best Buy is good company to work for. They offer good benefits and incentives for employees. However, if you work part-time, work hours may be hard to come by at time."
good,"A typical day at work can sometimes be slow and some days busy, but whatever day it is, there is always something to do. Most of my managers are really cool but there are a few that I question their professionalism, nonetheless the environment at Best Buy is enjoyable. My coworkers are the best and that's probably the best part of the job, is seeing them. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers, but through my time at Best Buy, I've learned to not take things personally and to let it go."
good,"Comfortable  workplace overall."
good,"Ive been working at bestbuy for 2 years and its a good place to work if you're a student. If you're part time, hours can be inconsistent and quite low, but wont matter too much if you're also a fulltime student. It's a good place to learn customer service skills as well sales skills."
good,"Great job if you didn't count management, If you are a technology geek this is a great place for you. Always something new to learn about. But it can also seem like a high school with all the little clicks inside the store."
good,"People I work with are awesome, the pay is not so good. Working here is fun but I would not recommend as a career. The people are awesome and you get to learn lots of cool things."
good,Fun place to work. Fun atmosphere. Great mgmt. Customers are pretty cool for the most part. There are times where you may get pulled off break to work.
good,"Its a great job to learn skills from knowledgeable staff, and a great place to learn different departments and product knowledge ."
good,"Best buy was a laid back job, it wasn't too demanding, I have no complaints. If you love gaming or tech stuff it's a nice place to work."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"When I worked there I enjoyed going to work each shift. The morning meetings were fun, and the management staff were very friendly and approachable."
good,"It was alright, but the management was a bit out of order. The security guard kept hitting on customers."
good,"The management at Best Buy are able to make work enjoyable for the variety of ages and diverse backgrounds, while maintaining an effective and efficient business plan."
good,"good place to work. lots of fun. lots of energy. great benefits for full time employees. stock options.401k,insurance"
good,"Awesome management, they are great the customer service is fantastic the people you work with can be a bit weird but will do their job well!"
good,Loved working for this company!! They love to reward their employees and create a fair environment! I had a bad experience with some management but they got weeded out after a year.
good,"We have Barbeques, group outings, and help each other out. There are training modules to keep you up to date with produces, and updates. Sometimes you don't have time to take a break. If everyone on the team, is a team player, then things will go smoothly."
good,A typical day at Best Buy would be that you are always on your toes. Customers are always needing help and it is best that you update yourself with every day appliances and technology because all that info is useful and part of the job.
good,they treat temps like slaves. They love there hired on staff. The leads dont know there job . the clamp drivers know more then some leads
good,This employer provided balance between environment at work and allowing flexibility to maintain requirements of being a student
good,"A typical day working here involved shipping packages, packing product, and sending out gift wrapping packages. This was hard work, and was done at a fast pace. I enjoyed working here, but the hardest part of the job was that it was seasonal, and only lasted over the holidays."
good,":Typical day at work would be getting numbers up for productivity to shipping."
good,"As a mobile electronics installer, I have seen some major changes to the way the department is run by the company. While it is a decent and well-paying job requiring little-to-no post-primary education, the continued trend of reducing labor budgets for the department results in fewer opportunities for those looking for employment."
good,Learn a lot but a lot is expected from you in a little time. It is very hard getting full time but if you can get full time it is a great company to work for
good,"I personally love working and selling technology and the training and knowledge you can gain at Best Buy is great.  The staff I worked with was full of great people and hard workers. However, the compensation for how much work you do leaves something to be desired, and lack of commission does make one look elsewhere at times, especially in the mobile department."
good,"My typical day at work was busy and challenging, which I enjoyed. I learned to be very Independent and resourceful. My management team was supportive, my co-workers were friendly and helpful. Project Team was the best job at Best Buy."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work, things are always changing and its very fast pace. You will learn a lot at best buy there are a lot of great leaders there. They try to balance out diversity as best they can, quality of management can vary like any job. The hardest part of the job is the work/ life balance."
good,Contact and make sales to customers while provided the necessary products and services based on a customers needs. Learned a wide range of sale skils and tactics.
good,"It pays more than the average, benefits are a little skimpy when it comes to full-time. Very easy with work-school schedule. Management was great, but moving up takes quite a while."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy is a retail store. That is either your thing or NOT. You will be there during no tax weekend and Black Friday, and the Holiday madness. I, myself, enjoyed working there when it wasnt those times. Im not a crowd person. however, the employees there are very nice and super fun. you will see people come and go like flies though. it stings when you build a good team and then see them go. I learned so much while I was there though. Team building, working well with your management team, and just being a helper throughout the store will take you far. it is hard when it gets busy to a person like me. I have found out im not much of a retail person and not everyone is. Thats ok. If you show up, do your job as your told, and smile, you'll do just fine in this retail store. Dont upset your supervisor! my supervisor almost became my best friend but work related you cant do that. It can be enjoyable or how you make it. The health benefits for me were awesome since i am always sick. i give this store a 4 out of five overall but there is definitely room for improvement in the inventory/warehouse side of things."
good,I was hired seasonal and knew if i wanted to stay i had to work really hard. I learned everything quickly and became number one in sales within the second month. Even though i did better than others i was not chosen to stay for part time.
good,I enjoyed the fast paced environment. I enjoyed the days I had side projects to work on so I stayed busy on slower days with fewer customers. Employees were mostly positive and energetic. The management did a good job at providing feedback and weekly goals for associates. Serving customers and putting a smile on their faces was the best part of my job. Dealing with the unruly customers was the hardest but also challenging.
good,"Typical day for an agent involves managing your own time to meet production standards. Good atmosphere, decent pay, and room to grow/advance in the company."
good,"overall a good experience, coworkers were easy to get along with, job was doable and tasks were always laid out. Management needed"
good,"Malgré que l'emploi était situé assez loin de chez moi, j'aimais bien prendre la route pour aller y travailler puisque l'environnement y était bien entre employés."
good,"Best Buy is retail. Retail is not anyones first choice, but Best Buy is the first choice if you are in retail. You will get opportunities to grow, learn, and network unlike any other technology retailer."
good,The Best Buy warehouse provides a safe and comfortable work environment. With great team leaders and a fantastic break room.
good,intresting and fun but there are many places that could use improvement on the management of the workers and the moral in the store.
good,"have learnt how to survive and perform well under excess pressure and when its excessively busy during sale period."
good,"Days at work are fine. The biggest hassle will always be clients, who are usually frustrated because of device/purchase issues. As long as you maintain your cool, days will go smoothly and when working on devices you will find peace."
good,"customer service plenty checking id's for online orders, creating orders, incoming phone calls, can be hectic at times. "
good,"I've worked for this company for many years in many capacities, and I can say that it's not a bad place to work (experiences vary greatly on locations). "
good,"Go to dept find out if i would be putting sales pricing up,clean and inspect appliances to make sure nothing missing.I learned differences in appliances.Often times told by 1 manager to do 1 thing told by another that they wanted me in another dept.Helpful when you could find them.Problem with communication between managers.Having customers come back telling me that they love the appliances that i helped them decide on.The other thing was having referrals asking me to help them find the right appliances for them."
good,"While in Geek Squad I have learned that no matter how intelligent and capable you are there is no advancement through merit. All ability to move forward rests purely on tenure and how much your management likes you."
good,"Fast paced, competitive sales environment in which our members come first. If you love people and tech then its a excellent place to work."
good,its near the top as far as a college student job in retail goes. Fun market to work in. plenty of discounts on items. Few advancement opportunities.
good,"I learned a lot about phones and technical support in general as well as how to communicate with clients. Account management and sales are part of the job. I often have to act as a liaison between clients and their wireless providers, so being able to communicate clearly is a skill i picked up. Every few months we will have a batch of new employees that i typically will play a large part in training, since i'm the senior employee in my department."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"the longer you stay, the more you hate management and the more versed you are in tech and you will definitely be able to get another job."
good,"The people that work here are generally great. If you love electronics, video games, computers, etc. then you will fit in well here. As an MCSA I would come in and check to make sure everything was ready for pick-ups, then answer phone calls coming in to the store. I also would assist people that came into the store for store pick-ups (things they ordered and have already paid for). I also helped at customer service with returns and exchanges and at the front lanes with check out. I was originally only suppose to be responsible for answering calls and pickups, but then they threw in customer service, which I think was a big mistake. Calls would often have to go unanswered since we were told that customers in the store were more important than the ones calling into the store. It seems management realized this is a bad idea and are trying to correct that."
good,"management would work with you on the sales floor and not be in the office all day"
good,"picker and processor in dot com at times. I picked high dollar items for store too. i trained others to pick too. i liked my job,"
good,Best Buy is a good place to work. Management is very good. Jobs are easy but the main problem is irregular hours and also no security of job
good,"Best Buy creates a fun atmosphere to work in, especially for young adults trying to develop their skill sets.  The company provides a lot of opportunity for advancement and offers some benefits even for part time workers.  In my time there, I learned so many valuable lessons and took away more than just a paycheck.  I got basic knowledge of the industry I wanted to go into as well as leadership and training experience."
good,"Working at Best Buy has taught me that when you provide excellent customer service, you will have customers that always come back for that very same service."
good,I enjoy working with customers. They make the day different; a challenge and fun. You can also make a customers a difference in the customers purchase whether it's good or bad and they will let you know.
good,"Geek Squad provides training on lastest technologies and services. Cross training is provided so Geek Squad agents can learn more skills, builiding up their knowledge and career growth opportunities."
good,I worked for nearly 10 year with Best Buy and had a blast working there. Started there as a seasonal employee and made it to management level. The people that you work with are the reason to be there. Pay is not great until you make it supervisory level but I would recommend working there to anyone.
good,While working here I seen pretty much everything in the customer service scene. As a Geek Squad Agent we assist the Tech Savy as well as the not so Tech Savy. With that being said some days where just the days that make you want to Quit. However all the departments where like a family. When my best friend passed away and he worked at BestBuy the whole store felt my pain of the loss of a great amazing person. Those people assisted me more than just to get my work done but in making my life better.
good,You learn about all the new gadgets that are released and they make it easy to learn them. You get to have the technology their to have your hands on. Management seems pretty stable and once you get management you are there for a while so it makes it a little difficult for others to move up. The hardest part of the job is having the patience  for some customers. The most enjoyable part would have to be the people you work with and making it a fun environment.
good,A great company with great benefits but its is difficult to move up without knowing individuals at the top. I did enjoy the people.
good,Good company.  They care about their associates and their customers.  Fun and fast paced environment. always wants to do what's right for the customer.
good,"Helping people here is a great achievement. People come to buy things they want instead of what they need. So you know when people leave the place, they're happy. Great thing about the job is helping customers be satisfied with their purchase."
good,"I had a great time there, unfortunately I was hired knowing I was working a seasonal position. I enjoyed the customers because they were very knowledgable in electronics which I relate to. I would love to work there again!"
good,"Although, I was a seasonal worker, I did enjoy my time there. The staff were great and the managers were very easy going."
good,"Selling customer solutions. "
good,"This place is great for a first job. Customer service is a skill that I believe all should experience. Very enjoyable place to work, very clean and managed in a fairly decent manner."
good,"Best Buy is a good entry level company that allows for growth and advancement.  There is not a very good work and life balance.  Other than that, I learned a lot from this company and got management experience as well.  This company taught me how to read a P&L and how to efficiently help run a $22 million dollar business.  The only other con was the opportunity for advancement included relocation."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"My 8 years at Best Buy were great! As with any large retailer, sometimes employees get lost in the job advancement segment. No sales commission was the biggest miss for me. To be held to such stringent sales metrics and not be rewarded financially is tough for motivation. Granted Best Buy did have a pay accelerator, but it was dependent on the stores success, so as an individual contributor if you excelled, you didn't always bonus. On top of that, it was a small percentage of your pay and taxes ate up so much of it."
good,"General duties are: Help customers have the best service experience, assisting customers in finding out what technology suits their needs, use product knowledge to educate and help customers with their purchases, daily inventory scans, stocking merchandise, cashier, maintaining an organized work station and department."
good,"difficult at times, youre placed in areas youre good at but not necessarily places you want to be. if youre good at sales and and deliveries, typically youll be put in sales"
good,"Team and People friendly."
good,Good place to move up for performance. Over all job is very good it all depends on the GM you get in your store. Great benefits and pay once you move up to supervisor or above.
good,"Being an Advanced Repair Agent at Geek Squad turned out to be a surprisingly stressful situation.  Coupled with near zero reward or recognition, it could demoralize someone not prepared for the responsibility. However, surviving opens up many opportunities for self-improvement, through both formal and informal training.  Customer service skills are a necessity, and if you don't possess them, this position will teach them to you.  Technical reference material and peer support is extraordinarily educational."
good,This job was very busy and I would always be helping out the most that I can I would always be busy I would clean up all of my department and when I was finished I would go to a different department and help out if they needed the help.
good,"A fun and active environment to work at. Good music, good vibes. I enjoyed working with customers and meeting different people."
good,"the job was easy simple minded, get to know the product, educated the buyer. there was not  much selling involved. if a customer walked into the store its for a reason"
good,The one thing that I can honestly say about my position within Best Buy is that every day brought something new so it was never boring.  I was constantly meeting different people and traveling to different areas of Western New York.  Would I want to do it again?  Absolutely.  My boss and my co-workers were fun and exciting to work with.  The only thing that I could complain about is the pay as I felt severely underpaid for the amount of work that I did.
good,"It is a good place to work. Restructures too much, which creates fear to advance. The pay is low for the work. The time goes by quickly."
good,"Selling electronics, specifically computers and tablets. Daily goals and duties to achieve. Management very approachable and helpful. Some politics observed, but nothing that felt oppressive or unfair. Store, but mostly own department, felt comfortable and somewhat familial in working together as a team and was overall enjoyable to go to work. Motto is ""having fun while being the best"" and right until the end it felt like that."
good,"Laid back, basically set off to do your own thing but still have to meet sales goals. I actually really like the place. If only the pay were high or if we were on commission."
good,"Working at Best Buy was fun. There were the occassional management issues, but overall it was a good place to work. The staff was always friendly and working at Best Buy meant that your opinions would be heard and often given credence."
good,"okay, it's fine I guess. I barely get any hours. I rake in $379 per hour for this company but they pay me $10.50... Makes me feel like an undermined employee."
good,"Great company, and when you get to know the employees it can become a great place to work. The world of technology changes all the time, and Best Buy has a great learning lounge for people who are unaware. Most positions are for selling products, and you should join Geek Squad if you don't like selling services - that's what you will have to do every day. Even being an ARA (Advanced Repair Agent), I still have to sell products/services in a professional way. However once you want to move up the room for negotiating your wage is a tricky thing to do."
good,I enjoyed working there. They are very friendly and make it a fun place to work. I've learned how to sell to customers and learned different things about the different departments.
good,"Great place to learn the latest technological products, selling the top products of industry leaders in their field on a daily basis."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Depending on the location it's generally the best retail has to offer. It can be a truly fun environment and is generally a pretty positive experience going to work. At times it can be challenging but the job is always achievable. The holiday times can be a little rough with long hours, inflexible schedules, and crazy customer interactions. Without a doubt I would recommend Best Buy as a place to start your work experience because it teaches a wealth of valuable knowledge and experience."
good,This was once a great company to work for. I only wish the company hadn't changed so dramatically over the past 5 years. Still a great place for a part time job.
good,"Typical is clocking morning inventory then wiped down the display and power on the compute. "
good,After 9 years with the company I have seen a great deal of it's ups and downs. As with any other industry my experiences can (and did) vary dramatically based on the position I held and the location I was working in. Overall the benefits long outweighed the struggles but it is time to move on.
good,I absolutely loved working here. I only left because I was only working 2 days a week and that wasn't helping me in my everyday life.
good,"Best Buy is a fun place to work, but like all retail jobs, sometimes you get a few more hours than you want and the pay is not quite worth it during holidays."
good,"It's a job.  They train you well and give you the tools you need most time.   You need to be positive and there will be rough patches.  Holidays are almost mandatory to work especially during winter months.  Every store is different in customers, coworkers and managers so you need to roll with the punches.  There will be days that suck and are boring but there are also people that genuinely make it fun.  For most people it will be a job, not a career so there's a pretty big turnover rate with employees."
good,I loved that there was always something to do even when you did not have a customer. I learned to perfect working with people and fine tune my communication skills as a worker.
good,"One Team, One Dream, is the saying we use at BestBuy."
good,"The daily life of the job is all over the place, but that is not the fault of Best Buy, nor anyone else, as consumer rushes happen, and as such so do client rushes. But when there is down time, you can normally talk with one of the advanced repair agents to learn things from them, or do online classes to help advance yourself. Opportunities for advancement are non-existent at this location, which is a sad thing really."
good,"On a daily basis I take stock counts on various items for the store.  A full inventory of the stock is done twice in a year.  I am very adept with computers and programming, as well as logistics and shipping.  I am part of the leadership team of the store and see to the work of the Merchandising team.  The hardest part of the job is determining the difference between theft, shipping errors, or order processing, to determine the cause of ""shrink"" for the store.  Shrink is the monetary loss of property for the store.  The most enjoyable part of the job is solving problems for the store, causing a loss in the shrink for the store, which means better bonuses for all employees.  I also enjoy the comradery with my fellow coworkers."
good,A typical day consist of incoming and outgoing phone calls for home delivery. Customer complaints addressed and driver issues resolved.
good,My job was to inform customers on items they wanted to buy. The best part of this job was the great group of employees that were willing to help me with any questions or concerns. The hardest part of that job was working 16 hours on Black Friday.
good,Started out in a temp position on sales floor. Great staff and management. Best pay and benefits available. Overall incredible place to work.
good,"A Typical day at work would include taking in computer to be sent out for repair, repairing them myself or giving them back once they have been repaired."
good,"A day of work at Best Buy for me includes greeting customers and thanking them for coming in. As well as distributing store keys, monitoring expensive merchandise in lock up and observing customers to prevent shrink. "
good,"My time at Best Buy was splendid however the continuous shift in managers and supervisors always led to a rather uncomfortable work environments as rapid policy changes were often with each new manager or supervisor. Adapting was fine, but coupled with the fact that BBY employees do not make commission off of large sales it made we wish to seek out employment where I would be compensated more for the work I did."
good,I learned so many metrics of business working for Best Buy and quickly advanced through the ranks. Best Buy really empowers it's workers and leaders through extensive training and allowing insight into a ton of different financial metrics for in store and in district.
good,"At Geek Squad we had a great team, good environment and fun. My typical work days was dealing with customers face to face and helping the with their computer issues. To see the customer walk away happy was the best part of the day."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Good environment with daily goals set for each employee, does give you a proper knowledge on how the cellphone companies work, but not enough on the devices themselves. Management is ok, eversince the futurshop and bestbuy union, the mentality changed alot, it used to be customer service first and then sales, now we prioritize sales."
good,"Best Buy was my first job and they cared about me. There were peers that helped me develop my skills. The environment is pretty casual until the holidays and then it can get hectic. Otherwise, scheduling has never been an issue as they've worked around my class schedule and other things."
good,"A great place to learn all the necessary skills such as customer service, customer facing, and most importantly selling skills. All skills that could be applied later to a career of your choice!"
good,This was a good job for a seasonal job. It was fast paced and customers were pleasant.  Management was good.  I worked as a cashier making sure each customer was taken care of thoroughly and satisfied with their purchases.
good,It's a fun place to be at because of all the technology you deal with on a day to day basis. The company has a great culture around creating a word class customer experience and its nice to see all the managers on the same page.
good,"At Best Buy Mobile you are around the latest technology, great co-workers, and a chance to help a diverse customer base."
good,"Decent enough job when you're just starting out, it wasn't challenging and did not utilize my abilities.  It was a temporary stepping stone as I began my career, but my time there was enjoyable."
good,The job is very easy and the people are very friendly to work with. Depending on your department or team lead they would order food for the team at the end of the week.
good,I worked with some of the most energetic and fun loving people. I learned so much from them. They showed me how good i am at being a leader and also contributing to a team effort.
good,"•	Had to retain knowledge about technology given to me quickly before going on the sales floor to assist customers in making informed decisions"
good,Always got a nice bonus when we made our sales goals which was always a lovely surprise in the paycheck. Customers always a pleasure to work with.
good,"I was over LP, so I was basically watching cameras and greeting customers.  I also assist with incoming stock and merchandising.  I learned a lot about technology and teamwork.  My co-workers were mostly laid-back, but efficient workers.   The hardest part was extended hours during the holidays and staying later for the stock because I was a full-time college student and had a lot of exams around the same time.  I love working with everyone, just about everyone you talk to will put a smile on your face or make you feel appreciated."
good,"This is a perfect job for someone looking for a decent paying part time opportunity. Depending on your management's style it can even be an enjoyable experience. If you're looking for a company with growth opportunities, it comes down to favoritism."
good,"Have enjoyed the people and work at Best Buy tremendously.  Work varies from long to reasonable hours, team is determined to make Best Buy succeed, matrix organization tough to navigate at times but can be one of its strengths as well"
good,"Best Buy is able to accommodate my school schedule when putting together my work schedule. Solid benefits, plenty of hours available if you are willing to work hard and learn new things."
good,"During a typical day, I would be selling electronics to customers and hitting sales targets. Must meet the customers needs of what they want, and then try to attach services such as extended warranties, and setups provided by Best Buy. I learned how to deal with customer objections and try to overcome them. Management was alright as they pushed for services on products. Worked well with most co-workers considering it was non-commission based. Hardest part of the job was using a wave machine to lift heavy objects and then unload them on shelves up to 15 metres off the ground. Most enjoyable part about my job was interacting with customers and helping them find exactly what they are looking for."
good,Work flow tends to be slow on a normal weekday but there is always something to do on the floor. When myself or a coworker are not helping customers we are either taking e-learnings to help us with product knowledge or maintaining the department clean.
good,Each day I understood what was expected of me. I liked to get in the store early and get most of my tasks completed before the store opened.
good,Good place to work with a lot of benefits.  Lots of community involvement and the facility is great with game rooms available to employees.
good,"Always gretting customers. Great customer service everyday. Through my time at best buy I had the pleasure of learning how to upgrade phones, how to type rapidly. Hardest part of my time at best buy was the management. I most enjoyed working with the people I worked with they were amazing!"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work if you are in high school or in the first two years of college. Being a guy, surrounded by electronics is always great. Their is a constant pressure to perform and put up sales although it is not a commission based company. The work environment was usually relaxing because you are surrounded by coworkers that are your age."
good,"Something that I enjoy at Best Buy are the people. I enjoy working with my co-workers. I like the fact that I get to interact with people on a daily basis. The hardest part of my job is having to tell a customer I can't do something, or when a customer gets frustrated and yells at me for no apparent reason."
good,It is a place with a great team environment the store does not support more than a manager and one full timer which makes employee turn around very high.
good,"Dominoz was an easy job i worked there during high school. my coworkers were every nice and we all got along every well. my job was a very easy job , i enjoyed working with the customers and making for food."
good,"Overall it was a great job and a fun experience. A day at work consisted of 90% customer interaction and 10% merchandising. I gained a numerous amount of skills while working there, mostly customer service and selling skills which i has pretty much mastered at this point in my life. My Co-Workers made everyday an adventure and changed the environment to a place of friendships and comradery. The hardest part of the job was the management which was just short of non existent, there was almost zero manager/supervisor to employee interaction. The best part of the day at Best buy was the customer satisfaction, the customers where very appreciative of the time you spent helping them find the perfect item."
good,My day was very fast pace and overall busy through out the whole day we had or slow moments but it would pick right back up and get busy. I learned how to run a cash register and drive thru here first as my first job. My co-workes we fair and easy going. Management was decent. The hadest part of the job was just learning how to keep up with the fast pace of a fast food restaurant. I enjoyed the food the most and working drive thru.
good,BestBuy was a fun job to work at and i had a lot of fun experiences. They will work you though and use you as much as they can.
good,A fun place to work for a little while but this might not be the place to seek a life career with.
good,"A good place to start with, a friendly place."
good,"Maintained clean and orderly checkout areas, scanned merchandise and calculated total price of purchase, accepted cash, checks or bankcards for payment; completed check and bankcard transactions according to established procedures, counted money and issued change and receipts for funds received. Assisted in other areas of store, such as clean-up, shelf stocking, or keeping merchandise displayed in orderly manner."
good,"The Managers always did their best to keep it fun.  Even through the holidays, they kept the music playing to keep the atmosphere live."
good,Not a time went by that you didn't interact with a customer. I learned how important it was to always start up to date on all new product knowledge. the management was very helpful when needed and very concerned of any needs that need to be met while working. the hardest part was probably standing for majority of your shift but I can say it became something you just got use to over time.
good,"Dealing with people on a daily basis was rewarding. Help with becoming a better person, leader and business owner. Being able to find needs for customers and solve problems for employees was a successful challenge any given day"
good,Very engaged team with pulse of customer in mind. Interacting with customers and employees makes the job worthwhile.
good,Best Buy is by far one of the most enjoyable jobs I've had in quite some time. The management has changed over time but you have to be able to learn from challenge and change. Be expected to work hard but have a great time doing it and you will be rewarded for doing so.
good,"Good working environment. Customers respectful at times but poor management team."
good,"Good review"
good,Great work environment with a family oriented staff. Learned how to deal with irate customers while further developing my people skills and enhancing my knowledge of electronics. The best part of the job was the discounts.
good,Reasonable hours to be working. Productive environment along with hard working team members.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Being in such a diverse and fast paced work environment definitely presents its own unique situations daily.  One of the biggest things that Best Buy has challenged me on is to always be ready for the unexpected.  Rather customers or employees everyone has their own unique needs.  In order to be successful it is very important to individualize every situation.  I really enjoy building strong relationships with customers and employees, and improving the overall customer and employee experience.  My strong personality made it easy for me to get along with and relate to my peers, and I was always looked at for advice and problem solving.  The hardest part of the job was a proper work life balance.  I never complained about this to my superiors considering I understood the world of retail entirely, but there were long days and nights that took complete dedication and focus.  Overall Best Buy is a pretty good company to work for, and have learned a lot of skills during my twelve year stretch."
good,"A typical day starts with reviewing numbers and gauging which targets need to be accomplished daily and overall monthly. The next part is client interaction, stocking product, gaining product knowledge and for myself coaching other employees on how to hit sales goals. I have learned plenty of leadership skills through being one of the most knowledgeable people and through the help of supervisors and managers. The coworkers are probably both the best part about the company. Nearly everyone is willing to help out to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is making sure no customer goes unserved and trying to help multiple clients at once. However, in the long run it is beneficial to myself and the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is tailoring each sale to each client that walks in so that their needs and wants are met."
good,"Overall the Company was a Great Place.  As with any job, your immediate management determines your willingness to perform to your highest potential.  As a Store Manager, you are the ""unofficial complaint department"".  I enjoyed the people I worked with, and most of the customers."
good,There is little to no room to advance once in this position within the company. When an opening does present itself the leadership never promotes from within the channel. This is my primary reason for looking elsewhere.
good,A typical day at work you never know what your walking into until you get there depends on the time of day. Usually after 6 pm more busy. I've learned patience and my multitasking skills are on another level now. Management and co workers were awesome. Hardest part of the job was nothing because i over came any obstacle that came my way. Most enjoyable part of my job was seeing a customer leave happy and satisfied.
good,"Excellent flecibility options. "
good,"i loved working at best buy. The environment was great, i met a lot of great people."
good,"This is a great company to work for. My fellow associates are a team that knows how to work together to achieve day-to-day duties, including going above and beyond to make sure not only the store is presentable and pleasing to the customer's eyes, but to make sure they leave happy with their purchase and overall experience in our store."
good,A typical day of work would involve administrating cash drawers to all registers. Opening the store to costumers. Assiting costumers with their purchases and in doing that I help them to understand the product they are buying. Checking out cosutmers with their purchases. Stocking and restocking shelfs and labling price tags.
good,"My time at Best Buy has been a series of ups and downs. There were days at my old store where it was a fun place to work for. Most of my co-workers were fun and intelligent people, but the management and supervision was lacking. The culture at the store wasn't consistent. Some days were actually a bit intolerable because the management was inconsistent, The store had gone through several general managers and at the time of the most recent one, it seemed I could never advance despite experience and seniority. However I learned several things about sales, customer relations, cash handling and problem solving. I was constantly charged with ensuring customers satisfaction and there were days when some customers were more trying than others, but most days the customers were pleasant. I was able to work on projects for that would ensure the cleanliness of the store, accurate pricing, and corporate standings. The most enjoyable thing about my job though was the people that I got to work with and the friends I made from the job. My hardest part was a having to work with very little coverage to make sure that everything was prepared and ready for the customers"
good,"Overall very great company to work for. Was able to master my craft, and work with co-workers to improve theirs. The hardest part of the job was going through so many different managers, and the most enjoyable was interacting with the many different types of customers everyday."
good,"Co-workers are fun, training resources available to you are outstanding, and advancement in plausible unlike most corporate businesses."
good,"learnt a lot at the job , very interesting information and interaction with customers"
good,"A standard day at work consists of morning/evening inventory, Helping customers with information and selection of ideal products, and activation of any mobile devices. I learned a number of things from this job such as: DSLR vs. DSC cameras, activation and deactivation of mobile devices, ideal customer service, and interaction with multiple point of sale terminals. Management was extremely supportive and friendly, as well as coworkers. The hardest part of the job was learning the ever evolving technology of each department but also was the most enjoyable."
good,"Typical day is working and repairing PC's, Laptop's cell phones and tablets, along with working with customers to help there needs"
good,It is a fun place to work. Also they do give you the skill and tools that you need to learn. But there should be increase in pay for all they have the customer to do .
good,"Best Buy provides you with a new challenge daily, whether that be sales, inventory, or customer service."
good,I loved my job and the people I worked with. The management however had no idea what was going on. They had no idea how to do any of the jobs required by thier team.
good,days are spent learning about new products and developing different ways to help customers. Company is very consumer based and always thinking of ways to improve the employee and costumer relationship.
good,Best Buy was a great company to learn the ins and outs of business. They do an excellent job of teaching you how to run a business. However the success went high and interactions suffered and gimmicks began to reign supreme. I would tell anyone who wants to work to go here because they love to work you a lot and the pay doesn´t start off high but if you apply yourself it is most certainly possible.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I enjoyed my years at Best Buy. They have wonderful employees and     I enjoy the interactive and customer focused environment.
good,Typical day at work is running the building and making sure the business is running. You can learn the in's and outs of the business and the training is the best I've seen. Best part of the job as a manager is the employees. Watching them grow and succeed.

good,Very enjoyable work exp. Great co-workers feels like a family
good,The management and staff is amazing. I learned how great it is to be apart of such an amazing team that works together to reach their goals and exceed every limit. The hardest part of my job was not being able to work in more than one department. It would have been great to be able to learn about more than the front counter. The most enjoyable part was being able to help with every customers need and find a solution to every problem.
good,Its a great place to get a start in the working world maybe a great career move for the right person but not for me if you like working around people and electronics is your thing give it a shot the management is a bit bureaucratic but its not that bad and you can deal with it
good,Customer service and selling television. Cashier and clean department
good,"This job taught me a lot about customer service, and how to deal with alot of situations. I have gained much knowledge about the"
good,"Best Buy has a melting pot of clientele.This has help me learn, communicate with, & adapt in a position that requires providing excellent service to patrons of all different backgrounds despite cultural differences."
good,"A typical day at work includes assisting customers with their purchases at the registers."
good,A typical day at work consisted of constant and repetitious customer service and aid. I learned to broaden my people skills and make fast decisions when time when of the essence while always making sure the customer was happy and content with his shopping experience.....
good,The people I work with make the job fun. Customer service is not a hard job. It's trying to figure out the best solution for the customer and making them happy.
good,"Customer Service is the key to any successful business, a typical work day includes selling different products and helping customers leaving fulfilled.."
good,Like any job that has a lot of career movement with new manager's coming and going on a regular basis; As long as you could deal with the bosses when they were there and appreciate the time you had with the leaders while they were there it was mostly a positive place to work with good benefits and room to grow within the company.
good,"- Come into work, start taking calls, switching from phones to Customer Service for returns and exchanges, fixing problems when other employee's  mess up on orders or transactions. "
good,"Count cash, balance registers, provide excellent customer service. Assist customer and employees with their experience and concerns. make sure all paper work is completed and filed properly."
good,"Everyday is different. Challenge and Change are two of the most important pieces. Retail is something that many try to predict, but cannot - we cannot know who will come and buy, but those are things that we are suppose to control."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,You will learn everything about everything in the world of electronics.
good,"Spend your day working with customers and giving them the best experience to meet their needs."
good,"I find that it is very easy to move up in the company. However, when you are a line level employee, managers and supervisors will pressure you to honor the store policies and when it is time to enforce those policies to a customer they have amnesia. There is also a lot more gossip than I've ever heard about at any other location. The employees are very friendly and always do their best to coach you on anything you aren't sure about."
good,"I worked for best buy mobile for about six months and although I enjoyed my time there as a part-timer I felt that they were more concerned about money than they were about customers. Honestly, working in my store was like being in high school all over again but i assume that's everywhere now a days, even in a professional setting. If you're looking to advanced in business best buy is great but as a nursing major it just wasn't what I was looking for but it did give me the experience needed with customer service skills and how to control many things about myself."
good,The job compensation was not too great but the people you work with  and the knowledge gained makes it nice
good,Best Buy is a fun place to work. I work directly with customers teaching and giving impartial advice on products and services. I enjoy my coworkers and my managers are very helpful. I have learned alot about phones and current electronics all in one place. The most enjoyable part about my job is being able to help other people and teach them things. Sometimes I build rapport with customers and meet wonderful people.
good,friendly people excellent hours great benefits for full time employees
good,Pay is fair but the work life balance is not as good. Working weekends and odd hours gets tiresome after awhile.
good,Working at Best Buy helps keep me updated on the new technologies on the market. It also helps me learn how to interact with people and solve problems. It has been an overall positive work experience.
good,"Fully stocked department, selling Geek-Squad-Protection, taking online videos to update knowledge about the store and my department."
good,"I really don't have anything bad to say about the company every area from managers, pay, workload were all good, the only downside I can really think of is cuts in hours after holidays it really grinds to a halt if your not permanent and even then im pretty sure they got hours cut as well"
good,Your day begins by reviewing the previous days sales and develop a plan to overcome any performance gaps. Then you check the current sales goals and relay the plan to the team and how they will execute it. The team as a whole attempts to work together as seamlessly as possible. This makes a comfortable  work environment for all involved. Motivation is the greatest challenge in any workplace Best Buy is no different in this area.
good,I learned a lot about new technology and it was always fun cause it was different each day. You became a tight knit group with your co workers.
good,Overall good experience.  Concerns with yearly operating restructures.
good,The people that I worked with was great. It was always a fun time working at Best Buy. At times it could get stressful due to having to meet store requirements with Best Buy cards and things of that nature. There was good life and work balance except for when we were the busiest which was the holiday season. The pay was decent.
good,"The company has been struggling to get negative comps reversed.  There is constant change, and it always feels like you're in the middle of a fire drill.  Pretty flexible work environment, but everyone is doing the work of 2-3 people with all of the cuts that have happened."
good,"When I worked there it was a great place to work. There was a camaraderie with fellow employees and everyone worked their hardest to keep the company successful. There was a lot of tension, as well, in regards to not feeling very secure around where your job would be in the next few months or year."
good,"It can be a fun place to work at with my co-workers. I have a lot of cool people. I’ve learned a lot of skills in which I didn’t learn at my other job, receiving, and operating different machines. The hardest place of my job is having to do other people job at some points. But overall I like my job. The pros outweigh the cons."
good,Geek Squad was an amazing stepping stone into the computer world. It allowed me to develop my customer service skills and refine my computer repair knowledge.
good,"Working for Best Buy is a routine based environment. A typical day at work is providing customer service such as activate phones, knowledge of phone plans, have a full solution for customers to best fit their needs. I have learned to be more patient and evaluate the problem before dropping to solve it. The managers at Best Buy has taught me to become a better person personally and professionally."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy was a great place to work.  I spent my days talking with customers and training employees.  I learned a lot about technology, time management, selling techniques, and overall business acumen.  The management team would always do what they could to help you to succeed and valued employee insight.  My co-workers and I worked hard and had fun while working.  They are still close to me today.  The hardest part of the job was the hours.  You had to work weekend and holidays causing me to miss time with my family."
good,"Enjoyable place to work where we can have fun, keep up to date with all the new technology. Help customers with their cell phones and build a relationship with them."
good,Great company to work for if not wanting to move up the ranks fast! They seem more interested in keeping their top producers on the sales floor then having them train the employee's to sell more and be more of a closer!
good,"I oversee the Asset Protection, Merchandising, and Inventory Departments of the store. Also I now oversee the Geek Squad and Multi-Channel departments of the store as well. Daily I insure that Geek Squad can keep up with the work in the precinct and that our customer service agents understand what it truly means to offer and deliver exceptional customer service.  In the Multi-Channel department I insure that our customers are able to shop our store in many ways our web site, over the phone and in store. My daily duties include pulling inventory and daily revenue reports.  I have morning meetings with opening team members to go over previous day’s results and set goals for that day.  I meet with supervisors and managers daily and weekly (one on one) to discuss any new ideas we may want to implement to improve our teams effectiveness and proficiency to complete day to day task."
good,"Provided professional and personal growth."
good,"the job was very fun, having customer interaction and alot of problem solving but most of all the exposure to alot of new upcoming technology. they do a good job balancing the schedule if your a student but realize your schedule may not be as consistent because your not full time. overall positive."
good,"Punch in, and turn on the light for your register. Help ring out customers and walk through the required 7 steps including greeting them, asking them for the cards or any specials we offer then politely say goodbye as they leave."
good,"Long hours are to be expected for a retail store, an odd hours four hours here then a day of no work inevitability on a week day and then two 10 hour days on a weekend.   The management at the time was a joke, but they have since been ""fired"".  The people were great, other coworkers were always willing to help out.   Of course their was slackers as in all jobs.  The pay sucked, so try to work in mobile that has the highest pay rate.  You are not on commission like ABC so a lot less back stabbing.  I hated meetings on Sunday morning that is suppose to be my time with my family and they ruin it.  I enjoyed the discount the best."
good,Working for Best Buy is great.  The staff is diverse and many of the people that work for the company are fun loving.  The company has expectations that are set in place that I had to hold associates accountable to.  The hardest part of the job was trying to make an associate that was not seeking Best Buy as their career path realize that it is still a serious job and that all behaviors and expectations must be met on a daily basis.  The best part of the job is the people.  I love talking to people and working closely with others so this was a great place for me.
good,You need to be a sales driven salesperson to maintain in the world of Best Buy.
good,All Good 5 stars nothing much to say. Overall a good company to work with.
good,the co-workers at best buy were some of the best people i have ever work with including management. I wa like a family away from home
good,A typical day at work involved working with customers to offer the best products and solutions to fit there current and future lifestyle needs. Best Buy sales stratagy called CARE PLUS is the best sale stratagy i have ever learned. I got sales MVP and learned how to build trust with my customers. management overlooked me for full time positiions because i made more money then the rest of the sales staff and they didnt wanna hurt there labor budget. loved the customers and products i sold.
good,"Working As a Team with Co-workers, to get the job done in a timely manner, and with every customer, there is always a different or specified need. Completing each task while making sure each customer is satisfied is an everyday learning experience. The most enjoyable part of the job would be reaching all the Store Goals."
good,"Currently working at best buy can be a bit of a challenge, like not knowing what is going to happen with the company, you don't know if your going to get laid off or continue to work."
good,"A typical day would include many phone activations that entail a lot of confidential paperwork. Dealing with contracts and confidential paperwork on a daily basis, I understand and value the importance of private information. Not only am I taking care of the people in front of me, but I'm also juggling to answer questions from my coworkers and taking care of issues that occur in the department. My coworkers and I work as a team. I like to have a team environment where we all are motivating each other and helping each other drive the business. But being a lead, I understand the drive initially begins with me and ripple effects down to my coworkers. Because I take the manager role most of the time, I have to present solutions that offer a successful visit for those who came in. The hardest part of being a best buy mobile lead is ensuring everyone's happiness, the people who come into Best Buy and my coworkers. People come in wanting different things, whether it's price matching a certain product or wanting a specific product, but it's hard to ensure their happiness when there are guidelines and rules I have to follow. Making certain that my coworkers are happy are in an environment where they can work ensures that they can offer quality service to the people that come into Best Buy. The most enjoyable part of my job is the smile I get to put on people's faces, customers that come into Best Buy and my coworkers, after giving them a successful solution to their problems; whether it's needing a specific phone or needing a pen."
good,overall a fun work environment that also did a lot of community volunteering which was great to help out where we could
good,"Fun work environment with a supportive management team."
good,Orders and customers come quickly. This requires one to be able to multitask and finish jobs efficiently.

good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"•	Implemented asset protection marketing strategy to minimize loss. "
good,"Best Buy is a company and has truly bounced back from what it was about three years ago. Justified by stock market amounts rising from around $ 12 to $40, give or take. We are true believers in employee development and the customer experience. As a manager, my job doesn't just consist of training my employees, but of creating a true look and feel of the store that will increase sales by appealing to the consumer eye. "
good,Working at best buy of course has its pros and cons but i would say more Pros then cons.
good,"Best Buy was a great place to work. I learned a lot about electronics, appliances, and being a leader of my department."
good,Mainly my job was to inform and sale electronics depending on what the client wants...
good,Best Buy is a fast paced work environment in a dynamic environment.
good,"We sell different type of electronics that people use on a daily basics, I've learned a lot about how to use these electronics and there worth to the world now a days. I would manly be at a desk look at the camera threw out the whole story, monitoring the store. The hardest part of my job was when i capture someone stealing from the store and i would have to use force upon them until the police came. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing how happy people were when they would buy or use the products in the store"
good,Great environment. Work with some awesome people.  Salary can be better.
good,I had to be up to date with the current knowledge of technology and personal devices to keep customers informed with the latest additions. I was consistently educated in the technology field and provided with exceptional help to further my skills.
good,"A great place to work. A typical day is usually busy, especially during the holidays."
good,"•	Sales Consultant for high performing home theater electronics"
good,"Meeting customers, Educating customers on products. Good management."
good,Work/Life balance is not good.  Great company with excellent benefits
good,Sales goals need to be met. Work with others. Gained knowledge about home theater
good,"A typical day at work was organizing merchandise and helping customers. I learned that there are benefits to being a hard worker. Management was very laid back. The co-workers were professional and vocal. The hardest part of the job was dealing with problem customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping a customer, and the customer went home happy."
good,"Always had fun working with other employees, management didn't communicate effective"
good,"I've worked for Best Buy for over three years and for three different Best Buy's in three different states. "
good,"Stocking, sales, handling customer complaints and resolving them."
good,"This was a fun workplace where I made a lot of new friends that were co-workers. However, the compensation was very poor. The management team always preached that advancement within the company was a priority. I found this to be untrue and did not see it occur very often. Most of our management jobs were filled with leaders that came from outside the company. For the amount of work each person put in, especially during holidays, I felt under appreciated  and under paid. The hardest part of the job was meeting daily goals for each department and the store. The most enjoyable was the culture and times spent with co-workers after good performances."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Great fun to work and have fun while your working as long as you love people and the technology.
good,Day to day would be patrolling your area and finding customers that need help and information. Hardest part of job is learning everything about products with no time to learn them. Crash course in training that lasted just a few days.
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work, but when you looking for hours that becomes the problem. Since it is part-time, I'm only given two days out the week. 2-days out the week, is okay for someone who doesn't pay bills, but since i do pay bills its very overwhelming."
good,It was never a dull day. I liked how we had multiple phone carriers under one roof so we can provided side-by-side comparisons to other networks
good,"Very process driven, management always there for you, fair pay, opportunities to grow, up tempo work enviroment."
good,"Sometimes busy, sometimes slow, but its a very competitive working environment. Make sales like everyone else or make more."
good,"This was a seasonal job with no opportunity for me to become permanent. I understood that going in but, I still worked very hard daily. My co-workers were fun and energetic."
good,"An average day I'd interact with customers, locate and retrieve products, assist co-workers, report to management, maintain cleanliness and process sales transactions. I learned how to engage customers, effectively work with a team, embrace change, plan and organize. Management was great, for the most part. They were very caring and nurturing. They taught me much of what I know about making customers feel comfortable when talking to them and how to overcome objections when faced with a difficult customer. My co-workers were also very great. We created a familial-type bond, and did everything we could to help one another. The hardest part of this job was learning the many things about computers and network connectivity. The most enjoyable part was working with a team and interacting with customers."
good,"Typical day involved organizing departments, putting away shipping, helping customers who are looking around. I learned here how important it is to have a positive atmosphere with positive feedback from management. Co-workers were great and helped out alot. Hardest part would be handling trouble makers."
good,"I learned quite a bit during my term at BestBuy.  HR functions were  the greatest to learn.  I worked with great people every day.  The greatest part was working in the public, meeting new and interesting people every day.  The hardest part I think was people management cause everyone is different."
good,"Best Buy provides an honest, realistic management culture.  They are honest about their goals and how to achieve them.  But due to the sales based nature of the business management tended to ""sell"" you on your job without promotion compensation based on performance."
good,"I love being able to fulfill a customers needs with ""Geek Squad, Best Buy"", a great sense of accomplishment. Great Team members, i wish they would've found room to keep me on, would loved to  further my career there."
good,"While the work, and customers are usually engaging, sometimes the people above you don't take the time to understand why certain things are the way they are."
good,Teaching new employees how to work through the beast system for activating phone and also showing them the difference between phone and the company of Best buy mobile and other carrier stores. Best part about the job was the positive work environment and people that you worked with.
good,"Great workplace, with an amazing break room for the employees. Fun and exciting environment each day. Group discussions to help better the company and work relationships."
good,You are able to make a difference in this kind of businness by helping customer on their transportation needs.
good,"Co-workers are very dedicated to keeping employees engaged and having fun while being the best. Work - life balance hard to maintain when always connected."
good,"Love working around new technology and helping people understand it, Best Buy has great intentions and people to work with, some of the managers are not friendly nor care about anyone, and pay is way below what you would expect."
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company, even though I was just seasonal. The atmosphere was energetic and upbeat. The other employees were just as eager to teach me new things as I was to learn. The manager was very friendly and understanding."
good,A typical day working at Best Buy was greeting customers as they walked in and out of the store. I also provided good customer service when the customers want to check out and I helped them ring up their merchandise.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Arrived at the job, worked through all opening procedures, checked closing procedures, did security checks. Reviewed new products. Engaged all customers, answered questions, resolved customer issues, sold product, educated customers on products."
good,I loved working at Best Buy my time there was very enjoyable. Unfortunately I outgrew Best Buy and moved on to better provide for my family.
good,Gained large amount of knowledge through best buy. Good amount of ethics behind the company but poor scheduling and management at times.
good,My day consisted of 10 hour work days with an hour for lunch. The ability to multi-task is a must.
good,"Overall fun place to work at, great co workers."
good,"In store culture is among the best I've had the pleasure of working with, for the most part. Of course there will always be those people who don't seem to see eye to eye with everyone but there are many more people who are a true joy to work alongside which makes Best Buy truly one of the best places to work. Along with the benefits of working for the largest technology retailer in the world, of course. Seeing, and sometimes playing with, the latest and greatest tech toys and gadgets and being on the cutting edge of everything cool has it's advantages. The downsides unfortunately are the management skills in some areas of the store; like I said, there will always be the people you don't see eye to eye with which is understandable. Probably the hardest part of the job is dealing with the general public which can be interesting at the least some days. But having almost ten years in sales experience has given me some practice dealing with the not so every day drama. Over all at Best Buy I have learned the importance of being who you are and letting the best you shine each and every day so that the people you come to impact are in better spirits than when they met you. You never know who those people are or who they will come to be. "
good,"Long days to ensure great sales and costumer satisfaction.  I started as a cashier and worked my way up to management.  I learned sales as well as great customer service.  We  a family as well as a team.  Management was fair and worked as hard as we did. The hardest part was keeping the customer satisfied,  The most enjoyable was the team work."
good,It was a good first place to get a job after high school. I enjoyed the people and the products. Of course in retail you get walked all over by customers every day and management did not always back you up. Hours are not too bad and its not too stressful of a job. Pay was pretty good for entry level position.
good,Very fast pace retail sales with customers of all types. You will learn a lot with this company that you can transfer to your next job. 
good,"In general, Best Buy is a great place to work.  In my particular store however, there were a few management issues with one particular manager.  These issues tended to affect me directly, so my work days were generally filled with anxiety.  Needless to say, without this particular manager, Best Buy would have been a 5 star rating in my book."
good,On a daily basis I would assist customers with their needs. I would also use a computer to find them what they were looking for. Answering phones was also a big part of my days there. The management was always helpful and cared about our needs as employees. My co-workers were always helpful when there was too many customers to help efficiently alone. The hardest part of the job was trying to get customers to sign up for the charge cards that we offered. I mostly enjoyed the friendly atmosphere of my co-workers and how willing management was to help everyone out. 
good,Best Buy is a great work place  with a very friendly environment /.the only issue is that upper mangement is a bit unfair and doesnt follow through with there promises on certain aspects of the job.
good,"Bestbuy had a fun environment until a change in management happened towards the last few years. "
good,"I cannot say enough about my coworkers.  They really make it or break it at a company but I feel that I work with some of the best people out there.  Funny, energetic, and willing to help out."
good,"Best Buy in Marquette, MI gave me the opportunity to gain experience in a field that I knew I would thrive in. I instantly fell in love with my position, and knew after two months that sales are what I was born to do. I loved the management and team atmosphere in my store, and would love to lead a sales team like I had there again. I loved my experience at Best buy, but I feel like I have outgrown my position. "
good,awesome place to work as long as business/traffic is steady
good,I go to work open the store and begin the day with processing returns as well with customer issues finding a solution for them. I also schedule appointments for clients. Once a week I also count the store drawers and deposit. Working at Best Buy I have come a long ways in developing many different skills. I went from a cashier to work administration. I have learned to work on my leadership skills and customer service skills. My management works hard on to make sure that as a team we work together to reach our on goal that we are all working for. Personally the hardest thing about my job is dealing with upset clients because you really don't want clients to be upset and you want to find the right solution for them but when it gets to a certain point where you have done everything you can and you cant get a solution for them is just to difficult to let the client know and leave unhappy. I really enjoy working with my coworkers we all get along very well some have their differences but in a job mentality we all put that behind and work hard together. As a team we do a lot a competitions to get the gear going which makes it more exciting at work. 
good,"Wasn't there long enough to really see the inner workings of the company, but the people I did meet were great and the management team were very solid."
good,I was happy working for Best Buy for about 2 years. It was a fun and enjoyable work environment. The main reason I left Best Buy was because I was only working part time and was looking for a full time job.
good,"Sales Supervisor for Home Business Group"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Fun place to work although not very conducive to learning and development to the next level
good,"Spent most of my time tracking shoplifters."
good,Good Place to work for. Benefits are good and the discounts are awesome. If they paid a little more the company would be amazing
good,"manage product flow, customer service, store security, clean workplace"
good,"As mobile consultant we are expected to sell phones, help with technical support, service phones, activate old phones, solve carrier issues, sell MP3 Players sometimes computers and tablets/tvs too!, and accessories along with down stocking phone department and MP3 department with no promise of a raise or promotion and not paid well enough for our work along with no commission. Most new employees quit after 7 months. Managers vary from good to mean and disrespectful and tend to be racial and like one race more. Hardest part of the job is doing everything at once and always staying late more than an hour AFTER closing of the store. Always have more duties than described in the job description. Most enjoyable part of the day is the nice friendly customers and GOING HOME."
good,When you first start with the company its a fun place to start out. Because you get taught from literally every area of your section. They give you proper training and awesome benefits. You get to know your co-workers very well. You start to bond with group activities outside of the store. The management is a little off though. Their are way to many of them and each have a different style to run things. They also don't communicate with each other to stay on the same track. The hardest thing about my job is trying to balance my outside life and my work life. It seems it consume most of your life. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting all the new people everyday. Each person has their own story and its fun to here about their story.
good,"open store, check scheduling, daily coaching and one on one with staff, over see operation of store, inventory and deposits, then close store"
good,"Working at Geek Squad was very challenging but at the end of the day, you felt good that you helped another human being. Hours were long but the agents were great to work with. The most enjoyable experience I had with geek squad was seeing upset customers come into our location but leave with a smile. The biggest thing that I've learned is that you cannot manage everyone the same but tailor it to their personalities."
good,The best part of this job was the ability to play with all the cool products and give cutomers' tutorial and information on great electronics.
good,Great company to work at. Very focused on the what is right for the customer as well as not losing site of the employee and share-holders.
good,"A great company to work for, fun environment great culture."
good,"I worked the Holiday season. Friendly staff, not enough hours"

good,Best Buy has been a great place to work. There is an exciting buzz at the corporate campus and there is always an opportunity for project work.
good,"It was a great place of business with all of my interest. I love electronics and knowing them in detail. I had fun while it lasted, just wish it could of been a permanent position."
good,"Was very fun to come to work, employees helping each other out."
good,Good bosses
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"As a mobile representative, my daily duties was to generate a good sense of knowledge to customers with any questions or concerns when it involved mobile. I had to also activate carrier contract lines and inform the customer of the specific details that come with the activation. The staff their were incredible and very helpful when i had any questions myself. Its definitely a place where i enjoyed being and working."
good,"They act like it is easy to move up. Lead you on, and then drop you."
good,Great enviroment
good,"I loved my job at best buy. I worked with customers and helped them with their wireless needs. tech support,new lines, cash handling, upgrades and internet needs"
good,The best part of working at BestBuy are the people and their differences. Everyone has there own quirky personality and its a pleasure to see them all interact with each other.
good,* customer service
good,"Very busy as a cashier, always moving or something to do. However, they are flexible with other schedules and there weren't any micromanaging"
good,"Fun job in the TV section but not lot of hours, also a lot of micromanaging in my experience"
good,"Back when I was an employee this was one of the best Fortune 500 organizations in the world. Great mentorship and training programs with executive support and ownership. Also, they offered great pay and benefit packages. Currently, this great organization is under a lot of pressure and is financially collapsing. I hope they can find their way back, because Best Buy treats their people well."
good,Best Buy is a pretty fun place to work with a lot of great people to work with. Interacting with customers is mostly enjoyable and that's going to be the largest part of the job. I've learned a ton about computers and tablets and how to sell products from Best Buy. Best Buy also will send you on paid training trips on occasion to learn how to sell better or new products that will be hitting the market.
good,The day would start with greeting the customers as they come in. I learned patience with unruly customers. Management again would depend on me with difficult customers to handle them in a professional manner. My co-workers would also depend on me for difficult customers. Not be kept in operations of the store sometime would be the hardest part of the job. The most ~ playing with all the new electronics
good,Provided customer service and product decsription. Also performed cash handling and problem solving.
good,"I was new to working with electronics but it was a great learning experience. But with the hours and number of employees in each department, there weren't enough hours to get a decent paycheck."
good,"You are expected to push every possible service they have onto any computer you check in, granted most of the computers that are brought in need a good chunk of it but when there is very little separation between you and your co-workers and other customers they get wise to the fact that your selling the same thing to everyone. I did get my best education on how to deal with people here though. I loved the recognition they give the employees that do an outstanding job it makes it seem like the company really cares about you and what you do. Sometimes the management doesn't always see things the same way the rest of the company sees."
good,"It's always fun going in to work with my co-workings, most everyone is on the same mind set and always having geek talks. the news phones, games, software and toys that are hot in the news."
good,The company has solid values and good benefit packages... however work life balance isn't always there.
good,I was a cashier and enjoyed my time there. For anyone who loves technology this is the job for you
good,"A pretty good place to work. I learned a lot about more about customer service and the retail industry. Also, was given the opportunity to learn a lot about computers and services."
good,If you are pro-active about your development and seek out insight then it's a great place to learn all aspects of a business.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Management is very difficult to please and very difficult to find when you need help, the co-workers were pleasant and overall was a very fun job experience."
good,"Wonderful management team, the work flow was steady and almost always a fun workplace. Through advancement oppurtunities I was able to learn different aspects of the company such as sales floor to projects team."
good,"I priced products, set planograms, loaded and unloaded trucks, assisted customers, and put product on the floor. Being retail, hours fluctuated but were consistent enough to pay bills. Raises weren't significant but still paid better than most retailers. Managament shifted every now and then. You would get good managers and bad but never unbearable. Had a great supervisor who worked with me on time off and scheduling."
good,"Usually contact each customer and gain information to find the right item to meet thier satisfaction. Get customers to sign up for credit cards, try to attach protection plans, try to attach items that may be needed for core product. The co- workers of best buy were awesome people, always helped when I needed it. Always busy but managed to keep customers with a smile on their face."
good,Great place to work overall diffinately recommend as a place to work.
good,I enjoy working here but not as a main means for income. It gives a solid foundation and education for those pursuing business and or retail related fields.
good,I had a lot of fun working for a big box company like Best Buy. I was able learn a great deal about retail and customer service.
good,"10 hour days, salary position,"
good,"I worked with some of the top sales people in the Dallas Best Buy areas. It was fast paced and we had to have excellent customer service skills, and business skills to maintain the job. I however did exceptional there but had to put my 2 weeks notice in due to me relocating."
good,"Best Buy was a great place to work. I knew what I was getting into moving into a career path in the retail environment, but near the end of my time with Best Buy, the work/life sacrifices were too much."
good,"Probably the most fun you can have at work, along with really awesome co-workers and a team environment. Unfortunately the pay is low, no commission, but they are pretty flexible with any school or other scheduling arrangements."
good,"Great people to work with and environment, but there isn't always an opportunity to advance."
good,"Everyday, comes a customer with a crazy question about a product that may or may have not been release in retail stores. To inform the customer with a honest answer I always go over and beyond to research an answer if its something Im not sure about. Learning Lounge teaches and trains the employee so much, and the rest is strickly hands on which I love because it allows me to learn something new on my own.I love jobs that are full of challenges and learning experience. The co-workers are also helpful to one another. A successful job requiers team work and motivation. This job overall teaches the employee how to overcome challenges and tough situations head on."
good,The best thing about working at Best Buy was the people that I worked with. Everyone was very welcoming and fun. There was a lot of emphasise put on team building and creating an enjoyable work place.
good,Greatest part of working with the GeekSquad is solving problems and taking care of clients. Seeing the results of your hard work in the home is a great satisfaction. The hours are hard to manage and the Heavy lifting is a back breaker.
good,"There was always something to do in regards to helping customers or organizing your department. Staying busy was key. I learned basic customer interaction skills along with the workings of a retail establishment. i.e. registers, cleaning, scheduling, product placement, etc. Management really believed in the values they stood for and were great in handling the employees. I respected all of my managers. My co-workers were great and a pleasure to work with. I always new I could trust them if I needed to pass of a customer. The hardest part of the job was having to stand for 8 hours straight and meet the expectations set by the company as so much of your performance is out of your control in regards to sales numbers. I most enjoyed the people I work with and the balance of casual/professional work environment."
good,"Had a Great Time with GS but had limitation in the Yuma market, was a little too small and drive to phoenix was long for just 1 client."
good,"My typical work day consists of answering phones and answering customer questions and dealing with customer issues. I also process orders over the phone, check stock for customers, and do returns/exchanges."
good,Busy
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Great company to work for, Managment makes staff feel really important."
good,Best Buy has many great employees and is a fun place to work. Their Results Only Work Environment makes for a great Work/Life Balance.
good,"I loved the environment and the people I worked with. The company has good values, but doesn't focus enough on those values."
good,"A typical day at work was not too bad, there was a sense of family there. We all got along and were able to make the time fly by. Management was pretty lenient for the most part. The hardest part about working here was the stress from working customer service but I feel it balances out from when you can just enjoy yourself at work."
good,It was a great place to work for the retail industry. The only problem is that they are always moving positions around depending on how they peform financially.
good,"Best Buy was a great family atmosphere, it was a great job but compensation was not enough"
good,"Started working at Customer Service Desk helping customers with returns for the most part. Then moved to work at the cash registers. I was later assigned to a special project testing a particular department, its development and sales. Was later promoted to work as of their Sales Operators; in that role I answered the store telephones and assisted customers with product questions and performed telephone sales. I developed a spreadsheet to help the sales team track their daily sales versus department and store goals. I also instructed the other Sales Operators on how to use the spreadsheet. My managers were demanding at times, but great to work for."
good,"Good place to start if you want to get into IT. Your days will consist of consulting with customers to assess their issues, recommending services to meet their needs, and repairing the computers you and your colleagues have taken in. You will occasionally and unfortunately be expected to go onto the sales floor to assist other associates but hopefully your time there will be minimal. Expect management who wildly undervalues the importance of your work (the y have yet to quantify the importance of rendering the services we sell). If you don't know a lot about computers from a repair standpoint and are lucky enough to have a knowledgeable team then you should learn quite a bit."
good,Loved working in a technical atmosphere. The management left something to be desired but overall was rather nice. The customers were not as bad as one may think. Every customer had aunique journey which is good and bad. The ability to be around the latest retail tech was a definite plus. Awesome training programs and higher education incentives.
good,Very great place to work but lack of advancement has it limited and less desirable to work.
good,Media specialist(cds/dvds/games)
good,The only thing typical about your day is that priorities will change and you need to be flexible to accommodate. Great co-workers committed to doing good work. Must be able to work in ambiguity and be willing to make decisions on the fly. Flexible work environment.
good,Friendly Environment to be around.
good,"I managed all of the home theater departments for the Southern California locations. Merchandising, training and relationships are the three pillars to the job."
good,Ran daily routes to complete end to end solutions for products sold by Best Buy retail locations.
good,"not a great wage but great benefits. had a fun time working with home theatre specialist, those enthusiastic about things i was as well."
good,"Great place to work, always busy. Loved the ability to work with others and experience the new technology. Management was easy to get along with"
good,"My old store in California was fantastic, had a team that was well trained, held to high standards, and accountability was important to them. My managers were always well-spoken, and never had anything but the interests of both the employees and the customers in mind. I was recognized as a hard worker, my coworkers (including management) took the time to really know me, to know what I do well, what motivates me, and just to know me as a person."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I started from the bottom and worked my way up. It was a great place to work hard and to be noticed. You quickly realized that its a ""good ole"" boy's club. Lot's of cliques and backtalk."
good,"Is a good place to get your foot through the door. Good place to work if you are still in high school or college. You get to meet a lot of people, learn new responsibilities. They also give great employee discounts."
good,"Best Buy for Business is a great place to work with a growing Business to Business culture that you would not expect within a Primarily retail based organization. The Moto is to have fun while being the best, and I can personally vouch that they have some of the best people in the business leading and molding the culture."
good,I've worked for Best Buy for over 5 years and my experience has been mostly positive. The only downside is that there really isn't much of an opportunity to advance as the company has taken away a lot of positions with the reorganizations that they've done.
good,"As a sales leader in the building, your driven to drive sales daily and meet goals. If you don't meet those goals, it becomes stressful."
good,Awsome place to work but no communication between management and employees.
good,"My time at best buy has been great, its a great company and has a lot of room to grow"
good,With almost 12 years working for this company. I have meet so many great people. With that being co-workers or just customers that came in. I am thankful for still having many of them still in my life.
good,I had a great time working for Best Buy. My fellow co-workers were great to work with.
good,"I was seasonally employed with Best Buy from Nov. 2008 to Jan. 2009. I would have loved to stay on permanently, unfortunately they were unable to keep the majority of the workers on full time."
good,"Best Buy offered me a very competitive hourly rate and benefits package. I was treated with respect until a change in management in my particular store forced me to seek employment elsewhere (she wasn't as personable and easy to work with as the previous manager). We were given breaks and had a ""fun"" break room to relax in, which included snack machines, a full kitchenette, leather sofas, a large TV, and a few gaming systems."
good,Best Buy was a fun place to work. You get to meet a lot of great people. The Managers did not micro manage if they didn't need to. Very much a team enviroment.
good,A fun work place as a part time student. Learned a lot from customer experiences and gained more problem solving skills as well. Cool job benefits and working environment.
good,"Starting at Best Buy, you feel this is a great place. By a year or so you know the ins and outs and understand every employee there and what you should be doing to improve in your current position. at about 2 years or more you understand whether you are one of their ""favorites"" and will be allowed to work up the latter, and if not there is a lot of work around and phone calls that will have to be made to even get to the next position. If you find you have supervisors or managers on your side you will soon find out that you have a ceiling because they hate letting go of good workers."
good,"They really place an emphasis on team and individual development, and even paid for some continued education in related subjects. Helped maintain certifications."
good,"Constant downstocking while acknowledging all customers. Numbers based job performance reviews with management constantly reiterating the importance of credit card applications as well as other subscription based services. Dealing with difficult customers and managers/supervisors while maintaining professionalism can be a challenge as with any job, but in regards to specific positions performance based pay and benefits are a warm welcome."
good,"I have back issues so I applied for the cashier/asset protection positions. However upon hiring i was placed in inventory which was too much strain for my physical abilities. After trying out the job position, and explaining this to the management, they where not accomadating and gave me 8 hours total on the work schedule for the next 2 weeks."
good,Positive work environment. Direct management support is key to job satisfaction.  Retail environment - Sales is key to meeting expectations. People skilss are required.
good,"typical work day includes a opening process that consist of product checks and security regulations. ie. gates and phone storage. the rest of the day consisted with assisting customers with their phone needs. ie. choosing best carrier, cell-phone accessories."
good,"Best Buy is a very fun place to work, but it is retail. If you are  in any type of leadership position, you WILL work every weekend and holiday and have ZERO work life balance."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Great place"
good,This company is a good company to work for. They help with what they can when they can. Support employees decisions. Great work ethics and surroundings.
good,I enjoyed working at Best Buy. My time working here was enjoyable and i feel like i learned many great things. I met many great people both coworkers and customers.
good,This is the perfect company for someone pursuing a career in IT but there is no room for growth. I really had a good time working at GEEK Squad. Fellow Technicians were friendly however we had a very manager. I left the company because of her.
good,I worked for Best Buy for seven years while I completed my degree at university. The company and location I was at always supported me in everything I did or needed.
good,"Don't hate the people there. I just feel undervalued based on my work/education experience. Not a hard job, just intense in bursts such as lunch time. Must be good at multitasking. Chill coworkers and manager typically. I heard that depends on the store."
good,"Mostly busy work but easy to keep moving. "
good,Fun Place to work. Low pressure sales environment with plenty of leads and managers to help develop your skills. Best Buy has all the cool stuff so working there definitely has its perks.
good,"Only one complaint on my end since starting working is that the schedule is only planned a week in advance and then that my hours were cut quite significantly. Other than that the work environment is great, the management is good, the benefits are solid (except for the console game disk discount is weak), the co-workers are friendly and many are chatty. I do hope to stay on in the future."
good,If you are interested in technology you will enjoy working here as you get to have hands-on with the latest and greatest every day. Workplace culture is great compared to other companies of this size.
good,Very fast paced working environment. Occasional downtime where you are expected to stay busy. Working culture is very gossipy but fun environment with great benefits.
good,I worked at Best Buy in multiple locations in varied management roles for the company. I had some of the most fun (and success) I've ever had in a job working there for some managers and the direct opposite with others.
good,"The Morgantown location has many great people working there, sometimes the management make weird decisions that seem completely illogical to the people they directly affect. That would be my only complaint about working at the Motown Best Buy. All the non-managers are great, they are very welcoming and many are still my friends. Being in a college town they are quite flexible with hours albeit not as much as some other places."
good,"Expectations were consistent for the most part, however, they seemed a bit ambitious, if not over zealous. Also did not enjoy sloughing off protection packages to people, when they needed simple solutions."
good,"The company is alright, Worked 3 departments and only was getting paid for 1 asked for a raise and got let go. Its fun job for someone out of highschool"
good,I had the best set schedule in retail. Sunday thru Thursday 7am until 4:30pm. I would still be there except the store I worked at lost their lease and closed.
good,"i mean if you like electronics and are comfortable selling and working in retail marketplace then its not a bad place to work, it can get a little pushy when it comes to making number but all in all not bad"
good,Really good If your in school for reimbursement and the discount is nice too. Trying to grow can be daunting because the interview process can be lengthy with Lot of competition.
good,I spent around 8 years working for Best Buy. They gave me an opportunity to grow and learn within the company. I started as a part time warehouse worker and found myself with 28 employees several years later.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Great place to work, friendly co-workers and good time off. If you want to get into sales or retail it’s a great starting place. As for holidays and scheduling it can be quite sporadic and up to change up until the day before sheduled"
good,Most of the employees are intelligent and friendly. Some of the managers were supportive and others seemed to view employees as not appreciated servants.
good,"A typical day as inventory at Best Buy is hard work. You're constantly picking orders, moving appliances, loading tvs, etc. The people you work with are great, and management does seem to care about you."
good,It was ok I really want to skip the review I just wanted to update my resume. They have a great cukture but its like a lot of jobs it all depends on who your boss is. If you have a boss that fits your ideals that you can work well with and you like a fast paced environment its a lot of fun but if you don't get along with your boss it can be horrible. That's the best advice I could give is make sure you like who you are working for and if not they will allow you to transfer if you can find a store and you like the culture there they are very good about that.
good,Best Buy could be really stressful at times especially during the holiday season. The culture there was awesome and the people there were really fun. It is a great place get up to date with all the new technology and popular gadgets.
good,"Overall the company has a lot of benefits that extend past just the base salary.  I would highly recommend Best Buy/Geek Squad as a place to work if you are a highly engaged, self starter."
good,This place is good to start your career but not good if you are planning to stay for long specially if you have skills and high education. They start from basic pay which do not do justice with your skills and education. They do provide benefits and vacation pay to fill timers plus you get employee discount on items you buy from Best buy.
good,"In the Geek squad section, you have to make sure to follow the SOP to maintain and grow within the company. The most enjoyable part of working is your coworkers, so make sure to have fun with it."
good,"Best buy was a very enjoyable experience. I loved the people that I worked with, the discount was great, and I ended up learning knowledge that I'll have for the rest of my life."
good,"Teamwork"
good,Depending on the department you work in determines the level of stress at work. For the most part the job is relaxed and fun. Employees and managers make the job fun.
good,Great place to work if you love technology. Management is always looking for ways to advance their employees. Great discount on product. Great training and lots of opportunities to move up working departments
good,"Best Buy is a great workplace for someone who is in school because of the time management. For those whom aren't in school it is a great stepping stone for building experience and personal development. The culture is diverse but there is a lack of official organization. I've learned and developed myself on better communication , time management , organization management, training, sales experience, and many other things. The hardest part of my job would be keeping other full time and part timers engaged during slow times. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that we are able to help customers/clients get what they need without complaint if we ask enough questions."
good,"Fun staff, easy to talk to. Retail, mostly younger workers. Overall upbeat and friendly. On your feet all day, but if you enjoy technology it's a great place to work."
good,"The culture is relaxed but the work environment is fast-paced and at times stressful. Other than that, Best Buy provides a good working experience for students like myself."
good,"The company is extremely metrics-driven -- which can be a bit of a shock if someone is not used to that type of environment. Sometimes, the metrics may seem hard to hit, but the company does provide peer and supervisor coaching -- even including role plays -- to help sales associates improve their sales techniques and hit their numbers."
good,"If you are looking for a first-time job, apply at best buy during october-November they will be looking for seasonal employees for Black Friday and Christmas"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I enjoyed the fast pace of my job while working for Best Buy.  I worked for a temp agency and didn't have the opportunity to be hired officially by Best Buy.  I would love the opportunity to work for them again.
good,You get to learn a lot about Electronics and most of all get to learn how tia just your personalty to match how people are talking to you so they feel more comfortable.
good,"I was always learning about new products at Best Buy and worked with a lively, kind group of people. This job is a good first job and has opportunities for advancement if you stick with it!"
good,"The lifestyle and culture at Best Buy Canada is very intriguing. The time I have spent there has taught me about current technological advancements, great customer service skills and how to approach customers. Being in sales, I am one to advise people on which product to chose, based off their needs and wants. It is also in my job requirement to suggest certain protections or services that Geek Squad offers in the event I think they might need some. It is a very chill job."
good,"es una empresa con buen clima laboral, que no tiene descriminacion por nadie"
good,"Great job with great people, but the hours suck. I would love to stay there if the position wasn't seasonal and part time. Nobody can live on a part time schedule."
good,Great company with a drive for metrics. I enjoy the constant communications and the fact that i dont sit at a desk all day however the work culture can be overwhelming at times.
good,"Engaging with customers and asking them the right qualifying questions and discovering their unknown needs for their every day life. Must be opened to working holidays and weekends, but they are flexible when it comes to requesting days off."
good,Many employees were friendly which mad it a very fun place to work. The hours weren’t too bad so it was easy to balance it with school work. It was harder around holidays
good,"Pretty decent job. The pay is decent as well. Atmosphere is friendly, benefits are nice. My only issue was that I couldn't get hours, at least at my location. I was trying to get full-time and they told me I had to wait until they could hire someone to take my position. I waited about 4 months and had no choice but to leave for a full-time job."
good,"I did appliance installs. As with most jobs, it is what you make of it."
good,A Typical day for me was going in after school and working both sales and warehouse depending on the demand it was usually busy and I always had something to do but often time it would get slow so you had nothing to door you could always restock for the next set of customers.
good,"This job to me was a filler job that I needed to pay rent at a young age. Managers were nice, co-works were nice. All in all, a good place to work and gain experience in the work force."
good,Working there prepared me for working in Enterprise environment coming from geek squad. I would say maximize the amount of time you have there and make sure that when you leave you have something that benefits you
good,In the beginning of working there it was fun got to know a lot of great people then slowly things change dramatically. Its a great place to work at for a short amount of time before you get burnt out.
good,Best Buy has an amazing culture where you can bring your whole self to work. The company continues to achieve their results and develop their leaders.
good,"love my job, love my job. Not fond of the holiday and holiday hours. I think we should be entitled to a Thanksgiving off. i love working with the people that I do and love working in the warehouse."
good,"It still teaching me a lot about technology more than I knew, also teaching me to have really great communication and also perplexed skills, taught me a lot of patience"
good,"The core ideals of the company are solid and if you can find a place that will be around and secure for the next decade then I highly recommend it."
good,Great workplace; though your desire to help someone efficiently may conflict with your company goal to sell to meet sales targets. I worked at Best Buy while in college full time. So they were very lenient on schedule making.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Working for Geek Squad was great. I learned a ton from the other agents, the Geek Squad culture was great, and they were surprisingly flexible. My only issue was lack of hours. If you’re full time it’s not too bad, but part time during the slow months was less than 15 hours a week. Geek Squad Pay isn’t bad, but it’s not good either."
good,"Co-workers were some of the best people I ever met. Fun, knowledgeable, and great friends. Management on the other hand was very demanding, focused on sales over anything else, and were not very helpful with work issues."
good,The job is very relaxing. Just walk in do what you need to do and leave. Job itself isn't hard but be ready to know no matter how good you do that you still aren't good enough and can do better.
good,A typical day at Best Buy was really active. What I liked most is the family type atmosphere. I never really had a hard day there because everyone helped one another. The most enjoyable part of working at Best Buy was meeting new people everyday.
good,"Talking to customers and helping them find what they need or a solution to their problem. Help stock and clean the store. "
good,"for a part time job, the compensation was excellent, and the work was in line of my personal interests, but management and fellow coworkers felt disingenuous, and tactics to maximize sales numbers were often predatory towards less experienced employees."
good,"My time at Best Buy is mostly spent moving items around the store. Whether it's moving pallets from the truck to the warehouse or products from the warehouse to the shelves, I always have something I can be doing. For the most part, they run a well organized system to meet customer needs. The different departments rely on each other daily to succeed. Management is mostly hands on, making a direct impact."
good,great place to work ..hours are plentiful but work is stressful but pay is generous ...the only problem is break are short but once you get the hang of the work it is typical work day
good,"Enjoyed my coworkers, it has a very fun and engaging culture. Management really made work easy to wade through and made me feel like they cared about me as a person."
good,Best buy is a fun and great place to work at. Sadly my location was not ideal and could not work with my schedule which lead to alot of problems and the management at my location was messed up
good,Overall working for Best Buy was great. They will start you out with a bunch of e-learnings and after that have you shadow. The work is pretty great and straight forward.
good,Working at best buy was great for the time I was there. I was younger so the pay was normal for my job as a cashier. I did feel like internal job movement was not promoted like it should've been hence the reason why I left. I felt stuck at the front and no know wanted to help me move around.
good,"It's all fun and games till the holidays, and everything turns upside down."
good,Nice place to work. Great benefits and nice group of people. Having a café is nice. Tented smoke shack is also a plus. Offers lots of discounts. Great people.
good,The job was good but I felt like I received basically no training. I just kind of started and did what the others there did. That was the only downside really. Everyone there was nice and I did have an problems with my coworkers
good,The best thing about Best Buy is the customer experience we as an employee provide and to learn this skill is a wonderful opportunity that is applicable in any industry when you're dealing with different clients and I am glad to be part of this team that not only is about work ethic but also keeping a friendly and fun environment.
good,"It's simply. If you follow the guidelines they lay out, and successfully sale what needs to be sold, you'll do great."
good,"Best Place to work if you’re looking for Fair Pay, Equality, A Discount and Benefits. Managers like to work with College students and work around their school schedule."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I only worked there for a short amount of time. However, I enjoyed the employees, culture of the workplace. There was a lot of supporting components. As well as the work ethic of leadership and fellow peers was encouraging."
good,"fun laid back workplace, decent pay compared to other retail jobs but experience could change drastically based on location. there is usually room for advancement but sometimes they can play favorites."
good,"Best Buy has been a great and fun place to work with. My team has been awesome, but there have been a lot of changes lately. For the more seasoned workers the changes haven’t been great but I’m sure for new ones it wouldn’t be an issue"
good,This is a phrase that is said throughout the day at best buy and it does embody what best buy is all about. Some of the people I have met through best buy have become some of my good friend due to us being able to have fun at work.
good,I had a great time at Best Buy. I always got to see stuff early and my coworkers were amazing. However management could loosen up a bit. Black Friday can be hectic but honestly those days go by fast and you really feel like a family at best buy.
good,Great way to get into retail with solid training. Advancement is almost non existent and that is the worst part by far. Have to wait for someone to retire or die to get an opportunity to apply. But generally there’s two dozen other people that have been there a lot longer than you with far better chances. Expect people to work for 12 an hour for a decade before getting promoted.
good,Customers were ensured their purchases went smoothly and with as less hassle as possible. The workplace has lot of staff and experienced workers who will always lend a hand. I learned how a workplace operates and how a business like Best Buy helps their customers exactly what they need. I think the most enjoyable part was learning what new technology or gadget was trending and learn what is being used.
good,"Working for Best Buy is an experience. It really depends a lot on the people you work with and the capability of the leadership team within a store. The company itself does a decent job of taking care of its employees, but it has some unrealistic expectations as well."
good,"People arer hilarious and the culture is top notch. You never feel attacked or if you make a mistake you arent made to feel bad. However........................."
good,"Did not always provide the best work life balance, mostly because of working all weekend every weekend."
good,Decent place to work. Leadership can at times be neglectful however is overall alright. best part of the job is opportunity to learn about different tech and the atmosphere created by peers on the sales floor.
good,It is a fun working environment. You'll learn continuously about technologies and what's new. You will enjoy all the activities and games that the leaders will implement during the special days.
good,"I worked seasonally and it was what you'd expect, very long hours and sometimes working 7 days a week. My lead made our time fun and manageable. Compensation was great and there were only a couple of full time employees who were difficult to work with."
good,"One of my favorite jobs "
good,"It’s a customer service job so expect a lot of dumb things to be asked, just remember answer it with a smile. The pay for how much you do compared to other jobs is honestly at the tipping point."
good,Great stepping off point. Employees for the most part are friendly and helpful. The Best Buy I worked at had a great culture. Hours are reasonable considering it is in retail. Difficult to find full time employment.
good,Best Buy has excellent training and educational opportunities and they do train you well into the position that you are going into. I was hired into Best Buy as a Lead.
good,It varies from place to place obviously but my time with Best Buy was okay. The discounts were nice and I enjoyed the people I worked with. We did run into plenty of problems with customers being stupid or miscommunication on our end but we worked things out easily enough.
good,"As a part time employee my days were short and my work weeks were also short, but the work experience was to my liking. Very laid back while also making sure to remain professional. The environment and culture was welcoming and always helpful."
good,"Overall, Best Buy is a good place to work. Over the years, it has become less laid-back, though that seems to depend more on the manager you have. It has become increasingly more stressful as the culture has become more commission-oriented, even though we are not paid on commission. They obsess over getting Credit Apps, to the point where, at times, you feel your job or raise is in jeopardy if you happen to not be particularly good at selling certain things (like Credit). "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Nice, well-paying job with decent benefits and not much stress. Managers are a little strict, but they only want you to meet your goals and push products and promotions, which are very realistic."
good,"I have worked for Best Buy for several years. The positions that I have held have allowed me to travel all over the country for training with high level professionals with several companies. If you have the right go-getter attitude, and a willingness to learn every day, this company is amazing. My management is fun and willing to back me up in professional and personal matters. They truly look out for me in all aspects of my life."
good,"I liked this job a lot. I liked having the opportunity to change people's lives through technology. I always went into work thinking ""what could I make possible today?"" and it opened so many doors."
good,"My time spent at Best Buy will never be forgotten, nor will my co-workers who taught me the ropes and reminded me that we are all working towards one thing."
good,Le monde de la vente au detail est stressant mais l'environnement de travail au Best Buy de Mascouche était tres agreable. Le support et aide donner par l'equipe de direction aidait énormément le travail à faire.
good,I've been there for quite a few years now. Fairly happy. There is room to grow IF you are willing to sacrifice and/or move to where opportunities are.
good,Best Buy is a great company for those in school. Managers are always flexible to accommodate the schedule you need and the amount of hours you want. Holidays are great for money but awful if you want to spend time with family. Raises are based on store and department performance so you will never get a full $1 raise unless your store is perfect which is bogus. Promotions are hard to get and even going from part-time to full-time is a hassle.
good,This job had great potential! I loved my coworkers and the department I worked in. With the online training it prepared you to better help the customers.
good,Not the best place to work because management is lazy but they pay alright and and have great benefit options and hr is very helpful overall not a bad place to work
good,"During the holiday season, as any other retail job, this location is extremely busy and additional hours are required. Management was understanding and flexible. Co-Workers ranged from experienced to brand new."
good,"fun place to work- customers are nice- can be stressful at times, but for the most part I really enjoy working there. they are flexible on hours and work hard to accommodate good performers with more hours."
good,Great overall job.  Great on job training.  The discounts are the best i have ever seen pay is competitive for all positions with a great bonus structure
good,"It was a really interesting experience. Having moved from Houston to San Marcos, I needed a job that paid the bills and was willing to work with my school schedule."
good,"Wish the Pay was more up to date with the living cost here in the area, people are nice and welcoming, great to work with and just a enjoyful environment."
good,Upon my 12 years of best buy I have ran into multiple issues as many do at there jobs but Best buy is an amazing company but what I do not appreciate is Managers who harrass people and get away with it or Drive good talent out or managers who micro manage which also drives people out. Good Culture in the store creates good environment and excellent results. Yes I have left and came back a few times and am thankful for the managers that let me back in. but managers who get called hr on and nothing happens is a big red flag. other than that it is an excellent place to work at and I would go back in a heart beat. Overall Best buy is a great company!
good,"Si eres entusiasta de la tecnología de consumo, este es un buen lugar para trabajar, conocer y experimentar con lo más reciente en cómputo y entretenimiento principalmente."
good,"The staff and environment are great, but it is retail. Weekends are difficult to request because everyone has to work weekends. Would like to see more opportunity for growth."
good,"Full time has good benefits, part time or seasonal doesn't really have anything. My location has good management, coworkers who really care about the job and are friendly and easy to work with. Great for those who enjoy interacting with new people every day and problem solving/customer service. Always something a little new. After geek squad added Apple repairs everything has gone upside down and on fire. Wouldn't advise going anywhere near geek squad till they figure that out (currently mid 2019)"
good,Management is not good but otherwise amazing job. I really enjoyed the people. And the customers for the most part are pretty laid back and nice. Best Buy is overall a good job.
good,I am very Fortunate to have  worked for a wonderful company.  BestBuy is difficult to advance in the company. Overall the company was very good to me and the benefits were great.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Enjoyed time working for company. It took a corparate official to make a terrible decision to get me to leave company. D.C.s switch to third party. Saw myself retiring from company.
good,"Present yourself with the ""Blue Shield"" uniform (Black pants and Shoes with Best Buy Shirt), clocking in on a PC, receive sales sheet to track the sales at the end of the shift, going to the floor and engage customers,helping them the sources and suggestions build up sales budget, suggestions, insurance offers, asking them to save money by applying for their credit card, conclude the sales, do all over again. Some of the youngest management's actions were quite heating up their loss so I struggle to reach the minimum requirements to not just make sales but trying to convince them for the insurance and credit cars."
good,"The facility I worked for was a very good I truly enjoyed my time working there, I have no complaints except for the reason why I was like go under my contract other than that it was a great work experience"
good,"I have been employed with Best Buy for 3 years and I have held 3 different positions, and been cross-trained for many other departments/ jobs. Overall Best Buy has been a mostly positive experience, and they are very accommodating for employee, management helps employees grow and help them to find what path they may want to take on in the future, whether it be within the company or outside of it.  It defiantly helped me refine my customer service and telecommunication skills. I would highly recommend starting a retail path at Best Buy. The culture within Best Buy is very fun and is care-free, while making sure customers are taken care of to the best of an associates ability; having fun while being the best, is one of Best Buy's core values."
good,"Best Buy had it’s ups and downs, it could of been better if they paid warehouse people as much as they pay floor employees. Warehouse empires are the  foundation of the store and always get over looked and under paid!"
good,"If you have good people skills and are enthusiastic about tech, this is the place for you. Yes there's the minimum dollar amount you have to get but it's not that difficult if you use the skills they train you with"
good,"Typical day at work includes checking where your productivity and sales are at for the week, check available promotions, contacting customers, selling, organizing, and cleaning."
good,"I worked at Best Buy for several years. The workplace culture was fun but VERY sales focused. Most managers were easy to work with but there were also a few that I did not enjoy working for. My biggest pro for Best Buy is that it is VERY good for students, they are very flexible on hours and work with your school schedule very well, they also pay quite well for part-time student-workers."
good,"I needed more money and more hours, they were unable to give me. Otherwise, very good place to work. Certain management was better than others, but everyone cared about the work place."
good,"Easy but fast-paced work environment. Despite me asking for fewer hours due to school, my manager still scheduled me more which became a bummer. Co-workers were excellent fun and work environment as a whole was exceptionally well."
good,"Unless you want a career in retail, BestBuy is a decent workplace there is room for growth if you work for it. Otherwise, it's a good place to build experience."
good,Stores vary per management.  If you have a good manager you will enjoy the job. The CEO has done much to save the company. I'm afraid the company will eventually fall victim to Amazon.
good,Bestbuy is a great place to work out. Has great manager's and friendly people. Really good job to work at and you can adapt to the job. Everything is easy to learn.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at best buy, my coworkers and management were caring and great to me.  I was origionally hired as a part time employee and twice was passed over for full time, once because I was unable to apply online before the job closing and the other was because the position was promised to another employee.  As I was part time I cant review anything about benefits or insurance."
good,Best Buy is a place where advancement is a given with hard work and commitment. Management is fair. The company is constantly implementing new changes and has high expectations/ goals for all employees.
good,"slow most days of the week, busy on weekends. great environment to grow and learn new skills. worked there for the last 5 years and it was some of the best experience I have ever had in my life."
good,"Not a career, hard to move up in the company unless you move to a different store. Coworkers were the best part of the job. Expect to work holidays..."
good,"Arrive before the agents do, so I can get all the product ready, the job schedules printed, and trash out of vehicles from previous day."
good,"Overall the day at work is fairly good! As always you have your good and bad days, but it taught me how to work with a team in a better manner. With how many managers there are in the store you really get to learn how to work under different management styles. The hardest part of the job would be miscommunication, as the store is so big with over 100 employees, it can be very hard for there to be everyone on the same page. The most enjoyable part for me are the people that I work with, they are amazing."
good,"It's al fun and games until you get put in a stressful situation with mediocre management always barking at you to hut certain numbers. There's no incentive to sell more or perform better, however, management expects all employees to work nonstop every shift with very minimal rewards or compensation. Employee discount was the best thing about this job."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The job is highly paced and requires the knowledge of products to maintain the best customer service experience. A job that keeps on moving and is highly educational. The culture there is very welcoming and very focused on integrity. Best Buy's main aspect is to be the best they can everywhere and ensure that customer's receive the Best Buy they can get. Certainly a field to work in for sure. Management will bring the best out of you under pressure and will always help you. The worst part about the job is sometimes customers get off the handle and the best part about it is how you work with your team. All in all, it might be a best buy for a customer, but it will definitely be the best experience you can receive."
good,"The seasonal position grouped me with interesting and eager to work coworkers. My interest in technology wasn't matched by the other seasonal workers, but they did demonstrate persistence with ensuring customers left with a rewards account."
good,"Nice place to work. Great training program and management. Co-workers are lazy and hard to work with though. Managers are willing to work with you and help you get to higher positions if you apply yourself and show up on time. "
good,"era un empleo agradable, y bien pagado. La ubicacion era de facil acceso."
good,Falls in line to what most retail jobs are with sales based goals in minds. Benefits and compensation is where this place can out pace other retailers
good,"En général, j'ai bien aimé mon expérience chez Best buy sauf le fait que je sentais la pression pour faire de ventes."
good,"Working at Best Buy for the past 3 years, and still working there, to me the workplace is nice, the staff are fun, and the work isn't hard. The flexibility of my hours isn't amazing for my college work, but it's livable."
good,"everyone was really great at best buy, everyone offered a helping hand when you need one. Very knowledgable place to work filled with brilliant people. worked with plenty of customers to most were very kind and nice. there were times i felt as if i worked too much and i could not fit my school and work schedule, and it was getting very difficult to manage, because of the holiday hours they needed employees, awesome opportunity to receive the holiday best buy experience"
good,"Good place to work , decent wage, but doesn't back up its people, will give customers what ever they want when they get upset, my store has a good team so that is helpful, great christmas parties, events etc."
good,"Everyday would be the same, usually open store, do open check in, dust/clean demos, make sure system was working. checks stocks and get ready for morning meeting. after that it was all simple, prospect for customers, approach every customer and ask what they were looking for ETC.  Hardest part of the job was overcoming customers who always said no, or said they could find better deals at other places. My favourite part of the job was the employees i worked with and the work environment. i loved selling phones and tech, i was naturally good at it."
good,Good starting point for anyone right out of high school. Lots of opportunities to learn more about tech products and sales. Managers know their stuff and are there to help you out.
good,Tremendous opportunities within the company if you are willing to work hard and learn. Best Buy does a great job of teaching core leadership skills and great customer service skills. Ultimately the work life balance was not what I desired.
good,Wasnt bad working here was really easy would go back definatly but wish on breals you could have your phones tho anyways you usually work 8 but when peak hits you work more than that
good,Very rewarding place to work with majority of co workers enjoying their job which helps make Best Buy an enjoyable place to work. Certain Supervisors/ Managers can make your job stressful similarly to any other job.
good,"Non stop work from the moment you arrive. Goals are unrealistic. Pay is very low, but the discounts make it all worth the effort. And management was always nice."
good,"It is the best company in all of retail, but in the end, it's still retail. The best part of working at Best Buy is the other employees you'll work with. Best Buy is the only retailer left on Earth that provides a personalized shopping experience for customers."
good,"Fun place to work at if you enjoy technology, helping customers find what they're looking for is easy if you know your stuff. Decent pay with opportunities to grow in the company."
good,"Working at Best Buy is good to gain experience and a good way to get your foot in the door when it comes to sales.  Although it is not commission based, they do have some incentives from time to time and a good employee discount.  Benefits package is very reasonable.  Management changes quite often so you have to learn to adapt frequently."
good,"bon environnement si on aime les technologies, mais très axé sur les ventes, formations disponibles au besoin"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Nothing spectacular just another retail job.Managers are fine. As long as you know a little info and are good with people you can be good at this job.
good,"For a retail experience, Best Buy is one of the better companies to work for. Compensation is more than competitive compared to other choices. The only downside is the chance for advancement is low, considering that once people get into higher positions they never leave. Definitely a smart choice for a first job or while going to school."
good,"Management was friendly. Hours were a little inconsistent, but was able to work more if you are eager to get more hours. Co-workers were awesome. Not a bad job."
good,"Very open and friendly place to work. Fluctuating hours through out the year is tough at times.  I personally enjoy working with new customers every day and finding out their needs and getting them the right products and services. Other times you get rude customers and you have to do your best to be calm and not react in a negative way since you are working. If a customer is being disrespectful, managers are always on our side to diffuse the situation and handle it."
good,"Very slim opportunity for pay growth. Standard sales associates receive no direct commission for sales or performance, but qualify for a 50 cent (on average) pay increase every year. The company is very cultured, with head-strong enjoyable management, but corporate policy makes salary growth very difficult."
good,Was a great place to work. If you love new and upcoming electronics this is a great job for you. Everyone got along and worked well together. Was a fun place to work
good,"Best Buy Canada m'a permis de développer mes qualités de Leadership, d'avoir de nouveaux challenges et d'aller chercher  de nouvelles compétences."
good,Great starting position for those who want to understand basic tech devices and if possible get to learn how to repair them. The pay is not meant for a living but more for a student or some one who doesn't have high living expenses.
good,"I would recommend working at best buy as a starter job.  They really do take care if their people. If the hours were better and benefits matched that of state or county employment, i would have stayed."
good,"Friendly working environment, along with helpful management and co-workers. Management sets up employees to succeed at all levels. Overall, not a bad company to work for."
good,I enjoyed and learned working at best buy. It was my original job after losing a 37 year factory career.  I was thrilled realizing what I had to offer that was not a (FACTORY SKILL).
good,"Everyday was such a stressful under the gun type of feeling. I was the only one in the store doing the ""picks"" as we called it, and that was looking around the store for any items people ordered. There could be TONS of them in one day. If I couldn't find one it was MY fault for some reason even though its all the stores fault for the item being missing, or just plain stolen. I also had to pull all deliveries for the next day and deal with my manager if one was missing. It felt a little unfair like inventory gets the short stick for everything. I got in trouble for not taking breaks because I couldn't find the time, and if I took a break and was unable to complete something Id get in trouble for that."
good,"There was always something to do, and I enjoyed the opportunity to work with energetic and enthusiastic people.  The hierarchy of the business frequently changed, however, so opportunities for advancement came and went.  Overall, the work culture was engaging and made the job more enjoyable despite the fairly low salary."
good,If you get a fantastic leader then the company values are exceptional. Unfortunately there are some leaders that have not been worked out of the company since their shift.
good,The job is good but the no commission no pressure is a lie. You are pushed to sell geeksquad and even setups on customers who may not need it to hit numbers rather than just selling products
good,"The company is more concerned about the bottom line these days, and don't use the basics of a happy informed customer will buy more than just telling them what they should do.  Its dollars per hour not customer loyalty"
good,"Good eveyone is like team get along a family"
good,Made a lot of new friends there that would always help me out. Everyone was really nice and the work environment was one of the best that I have ever been in.
good,"I would love to keep working here. Managing inventory and shipments is good work to do. The atmosphere is friendly and relaxed, undercut only by the constant stress of meeting live order deadlines and locating displaced inventory."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,had fun and had some bad times! was a good job paid good and was fun to work with a team! was some hard times with some butting heads but other wise i recomend that ou try it out
good,"Best buy was a fun learning experience but it lacked training and communication was a problem, managers never fully taught how to properly do tasks then would be disappointed/ annoyed when you couldn't do it"
good,I have worked throughout the company. The quality of your time working there really depends on who you work with and who you have as a manager. The company is ok to work under. They are very anti-union.
good,"Great job if you're going to school or looking to further your skills. Sometimes, it can be a little difficult to move up. But overall, still a great culture."
good,Best Buy aims to try and provide employees with pay and benefits that correlate with job market trends. Throughout my employment with the company they ensured to provide to the best of their abilities competitive pay and benefits.
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work, I just had trouble in the position I applied for and was unable to move to another department. I enjoyed the people I work with, and would love to continue working there, the hours were not enough for my cost of living"
good,"Geek Squad and Best Buy are great companies on the whole.  It is a harder job being on the customer service side of repair and returns so people won't always be at their best.  Even with that, it is often a rewarding and rarely overtaxing position for a good company.  Management at my store was a bit off, to be kind, but Best Buy was quick to correct their mistakes and replace them if need be."
good,"Never became complacent because electronics constantly change. Therefore, my leadership was constantly challenged. Day to day operations were different. Customer Loyalty is at the forefront of why the company has turned around. Price Match was huge."
good,Team environment with lots of opportunites for advancement. Product and selling skills and knowledge are built into your training. No experience necessary.
good,"Fast paced challenging work environment."
good,"Typical day at work was coming in and doing the daily cash/check balance, morning paperwork from previous work day, counting  and balancing the cash drawls, creating bank deposit, then working the customer service desk or working in the Mobile department"
good,"Overall the job is not a very difficult one and has its benefits, but is not without its downfalls. "
good,Lots of room for growth and advancement.  Best Buy takes themselves seriously and wants to get the most out of everyone that works for the company.  If you aren't afraid of constructive criticism this is a great place for anyone to work.
good,"It's a nice job, if you can afford to live on part-time hours in the smaller stores. Management is really nice, but you have to stand in one spot all day as asset protection."
good,"Workplace culture: I made some of my very best friends working here. The culture is how you, your colleagues, and leadership team makes it. Most of us worked hard and partied hard together, which brought is closer. Knowing each other outside of the workplace helped us build a better and collaborative team environment at work. "
good,Training and work place safety standards are good and constantly updated. Upper management does not always communicate as efficiently as possible  leading to people sometime getting conflicting expectations about what is excepted from them.
good,"Current store I worked at was always understaff which made my part time into full time without it really becoming full time. This wasn't the case at the other locations at the time I worked there 4 years ago. So your mileage may vary, good place to work though if you want to get back into technology."
good,A decent place to work. The pay was acceptable for the area I was in and I was given a reasonable amount of hours a week. Retail work suffered from the same problems other positions of this nature suffer from. Difficult to work with customers and problematic coworkers. Other than that the work is good along with the pay.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Product knowledge is a big part of the best buy culture. Best Buy provided numerous resources to be up to date with technology. The workplace was a fun and competitive environment.
good,"If you've worked retail, you kinda know what to expect. My store was very good about hands on store meetings where everyone comes together for the shift and has a clear understanding of the tasks of the day but corporate structure can often influence the positives of a particular store. Was a seasonal employee, enjoyed my job and the opportunity to work a few different areas to gain some new knowledge. Writing this review a few years after having worked there, so take it with a grain of salt."
good,Fun place to work if you have a good manager i heard other stores arent as fun to work at if you have bad managers. Besides that nothing is really bad about the place.
good,"Probably one of the best retail stores i have worked for, relatively loud area but still quite fun, especially if you're technologically inclined and love to help people."
good,"The culture at Best Buy is fast paced and constantly evolving. Processes are now moving at a much quicker pace. I would recommend Best Buy to anyone that is looking for an opportunity to develop themselves over a long period time. If you are only looking for a 1-3 year job, this is not your company. due to the size of the infrastructure you need at least a year to assimilate to the culture."
good,The company at it's core is great in fact I turned down a higher paying job to work there. After some time new management got promoted after my GM left our store to help a different Best Buy and my new management team did not get the support they needed from the market team and that quickly led to problems and I found myself trying to bridge gaps between line level employees and the management team. On top of that I was not allowed to hire for my own team which I found strange seeing as my job title according to the company allowed me to do so. This led to my team being picked from random candidates to fill jobs quickly. This slowed our sales growth although I took the team from a 960th rank team out of 1100 store and moved it to a top 50 team. During this time I spent more time at work and due to that developed a stress ulcer that affected my health while I was there. After a lot of consideration I decided to move on for my own health and find different opportunities.
good,"As a DFT I was responsible for installing any new hardware requested, removing unnecessary hardware, repairing faulty display systems, maintenance of in store network equipment, and any reporting or documentation required by the project manager. As a part of a larger team it was also my job to communicate any needs I had as well as coordinate with the project lead to ensure timely and efficient project completion."
good,"A typical day at Best Buy included contacting customers, making sure service was always the best.  I learned how not to be afraid to go up to people and introduce myself.  Management is ok, you have some that work very hard, and some that are laid back.  Hardest part of the job is probably learning how to balance life and work.  The most enjoyable part is all the benefits to company offers!"
good,No advancement and chance of advancement based on being likable. Employees feel sense of favoritism there and duties are not set and can change anytime.
good,"The culture was fun, the compensation was okay, and department supervisors seemed to care about their direct subordinates. The general public, especially for Geek Squad, didn't make the day any better."
good,"I did enjoy my time at Best Buy when I worked there. The pay is low, but its not a job that you really expect a high pay from. Good starter Job for just about anyone. I have life long friends that I made working there so I would recommend it for just about anyone."
good,It was a great place for me to learn my sales skills and inter-personal skills by speaking with people one on one and reading body language. It is a great place as well to get alot of information and knowledge on the current technological trends happening and the products.
good,"This place is what you make it, the pay is good and bad depending on your place in life and lifestyle.  I love my coworkers and the job is fun depending on where your at."
good,"Best Buy has helped me progress in life. I have learned some great skills while working for the company. The company has taught me leadership skills, how to run a business, and how to network and build relationships. They also reimburse me for my education while being flexible enough work around my school schedule. I love working for the company overall and would recommend others to apply here as a career starter for almost anything in this world."
good,Enjoyed my time here and met a lot of people.Enjoyed my time working here and the only reason i left was for a more stable schedule to spend time with my family.
good,"I worked at Best Buy Store 986 for about 4 months before I moved away for University, it was a good experience, and I seriously considered transferring to another location in Edmonton if my course schedule was lighter. However, some of the management is very prejudice towards specific employees/departments."
good,great employee benefits and discounts. lack of career advancement. good team environment. lack of knowledge from employees. great training programs with an online university.
good,Friendly co-workers.  Great place to work for people that know about or enjoy working with technology.  Management was very accommodating with all employees needs.
good,A typical day at work would include unloading the truck in the moring and then loading it back up. work place is friendly staff is great. Really good.
good,"Best Buy is a great place to begin your career. It was a great atmosphere on a daily basis, and I had fun interacting with customers. Co-workers were great as well."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Usually took care of front end services (cashier, store-pick up, restocking impulse items, and customer service)."
good,Best Buy is a great company to work for but their systems get in the way.  There are many day to day frustrations that really interfere with your ability to focus on sales.  High stress for something as trivial as televisions.
good,I enjoyed working there. My manager was great and so was my co-worker. I received a raise after every 6 months. I held multiple positions while there and enjoyed each of them.
good,Best Buy was a great place to work and was truly a growth engine for me and my Management training opportunities.  Sadly the company wide downsizing displaced many long time quality associates.
good,"Fast-paced work environment with a large number of duties."
good,"It can be a fast pace job, especially during the weekend. I've learned it is a very chill environment.  I have learned that you have to give the best experience to each customer.   Management is still trying to get things together since everyone is new, but so far everyone is nice.  The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to people.  The hardest part to people is having to correct someone when they have been told something else."
good,Loved it but was a lot of nights and weekends away from family with little pay. The team was amazing I made a lot of friends out of my coworkers. Also had an amazing employee discount
good,It wasn't a terrible place to work. I'd go back if I needed a job. Most of the management was nice and would help out whenever needed.  Coworkers were friendly and helpful.
good,While working at Best Buy I worked with many great managers that were personable and professional. The best part of working there was the coworkers along with the employee discount.
good,Best buy is a great place to start with competitive pay. As you go up the ranks it does get harder to advance without knowing someone. It can be political at times but as long as you network you should have no problem with advancement as long as your willing to put in the work.
good,"If you can be someone's favorite, you'll be fine. Otherwise you mind most managers abrasive and aggressive towards your requests for advancement. The pay is fair, the raises are annual and based on performance."
good,Being part of a 2 man team was fun. I enjoyed setting up home theater systems for people.  I worked for Best Buy for 6 years and the Geek Squad side was the best part of the company.
good,"Culture awesome"
good,"SALES GIRL Work at Best Buy Shop. The boundary of Tampin town between Melaka and Negeri Sembilan.Sell various gift items.Customer service,Helping the cashier,Fix damage items,Organize stock,register,Gift wrap,Clear stock,Arrange stocks,Perform other duties as necessary,Clean the shop."
good,"Customer focused with fun culture."
good,They pay well. It is fun. Fairly easy job. The holidays suck. also benefits are good. STI program is a good one as well. Hours stink though that's what I think.
good,"It was fun to work around the type of people i had the privilege to be around. Benefits are great, the environment was fun, all around great company to work for."
good,"Mostly Loss Prevention, did some retail sales in computers and appliances. I learned to sell in a retail environment.  There were several changes in management while I was there , some were fair some were not."
good,Large store retail is always stressful. They do however have some very good team building skills as well as many different options on where you can work in the store as well as outside of the store.
good,"This is a great job for young unmarried students with no dependents. The pay isn't the highest, but it is better than other similar retail jobs. Its a good way to build credentials and there is alot of sales experience opportunities. Managers are usually laid back and supportive."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Go in and sell to the best of your ability to meet targets of sales for the day! The big push is for insurance and credit cards! This can get stressful especially if its a slow day and there isn't a lot of people to sell to because they gauge if off of the previous year
good,This company sets you up to succeed. The training I had when I was there was anazing and nothing compares to the leadership. I feel like a well rounded employee and a leader because of what I learned from my managers and peers.
good,I learned a lot about computers and tablets while working for Best Buy. I also learned the ropes of customer service. I began working for Best Buy very close to Black Friday and was very excited. I learned quickly and enjoyed front lanes. I later moved to Computers which then turned into Computers and Tablets. Trying to beat other departments through friendly credit card app competitions was fun. The hardest part of the job was unloading truck on Tuesday and Friday nights and staying very late to stock the store with the trucks shipment.
good,Good environment to work in.  Co workers help each other out.  Pay is not that good for sales persons.  No commission granted.  Even though there are quarterly bonuses the bonus difference between sales associates and management were horrible ranged given that managers rarely assist in sales.
good,"Open the Front end of the store . Count Register's and issue out register's . Take Credit card payments, do return's , and solve customer issues. Also assist, customer's who apply for credit cards ."
good,"Phenomenal work environment, constant training and chances for prizes.  In charge of Mobile Department.  Following up in training, sales quotas, and adjusting goals/duties per sales numbers.  Management was a lot of fun, no room for advancement unfortunately, and constant company restructures.  Overall I had a wonderful time there."
good,"fun and great place to work for young adults. excellent place to gain a lot of self worth, and builds a lot of character. limitless amount of knowledge to acquire"
good,not compensated for goal accomplishments only base pay. Great company for people learn and interact with customers but they don't compensate the over acheivers lol
good,"I worked here throughout college. they worked well with school requirements (except during the holiday season) and typically understood school was my number one priority. I enjoy working here mostly for the coworkers, but do not see much opportunity to turn this into a long term career."
good,"A typical day at Best Buy usually includes the morning meeting cheer (if you have a morning shift), where they will talk about the targets for the day for each department, where things went well the previous day and where there could be some improvements. I learned a lot about electronics goods, and I learned how to sell products and services. The work place culture is fun but people also know how to work hard. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers. The best part of the job is seeing the smile on the faces of your clients after they walk out the door with their products and/or protection services knowing they've made an informed decision because of you."
good,"This was one of the more enjoyable jobs I have worked at. They want you to succeed and are constantly asking you what you need to help you advance. Learning about new technology is also very easy, with the ability to rent out certain devices in order to teach yourself by doing."
good,"For what it is that i do everything is solid but it's not enough to thrive or satisfy. Very nice people, with a good flowing culture. A good place to work"
good,"I love working for best buy, they give you the chance to be who you are while effectively promoting high performance. The benefits at this company are amazing and deffinately something everyone should take part in."
good,"Great place to work. I was employed for 14+ years and have lots of experience to bring to my next employer."
good,"great staff"
good,"Working with Best Buy was both fun and exciting.  The learning curve was never ending because we always had the newest and most innovative electronics and appliances to explore and sell.  As a sells associate I sold more than anyone on my team, winning many awards and sells incentives.  As a manager, my team continued to lead in sales under my tutelage."
good,great place to work part time wish there was more full time positions to offer. The pay could be a little better and more hour to work for part timers.
good,"if you have excellent selling skills this job is for you, if you want a regular retail job this may not be your kind of thing. Best Buy has so many requirements and policies. It can get stressful depending how well you work with customers who don't know much."
good,"Discount is the best part, you get it at barely above cost. Managers will get on you for sales if youre in that role, the sales process is stupid, you have to ask questions off a sheet otherwise they yell at you."
good,"Everyone I worked with at best buy was very outgoing and they were always there to help when you needed. The holiday hours are very long. During the summer, business slows down."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I learned a lot. Was happy to be here. I sometimes wished I stayed but honestly, it was just for the money. Retail, is retail, is retail...so if you’ve worked retail, you’ve worked at B.B. They have great systems and learning is easy. They give you ALMOST everything you need to succeed. Pro tip. Find a mentor fast and you will go far. If not, you’ll be stuck"
good,The employees and management at my store are all very close and consider eachothwe work family. Only thing I don’t like is the pay. I work in the mobile sales department.
good,"CURA ET CELERITAS NOT CELERITAS ET CURA, Your job isnt to show off your skills, but to use your knowledge to improve your clients life. Never say ""I dont know."" Instead say, ""I'll find out."""
good,"In the warehouse it was a very boring job. You sit there by yourself and do assessments all day but often there is an alarm that goes off, you have to get up and run around trying to find random products on the sales floor. But when it is truck night, its fun depending on who is in your crew. Its as simple as unloading the truck, sorting product, and stocking the product."
good,"- recommend and set up cell phone plans; basic cell phone troubleshooting and set up. "
good,"Pay is reasonable, awesome discounts, many locations have a good team environment"
good,"Working in Geeksquad outside the store is a very bittersweet thing. On one hand you are not confined to one building which is nice. I met new people everyday (Not always a positive thing), worked in a lot of very nice homes, and often times would find myself working less then 8-10 hours a day. The benefits Best Buy as a company offers are fantastic and they’re always adding more which is nice. On the negative side of things, Geeksquad agents are expected to shoulder a lot of responsibility and I personally didn’t feel agents were compensated adequately. On a daily basis I would have to deal with issues caused by the stores salesmen and more times than not there nobody was held responsible for said issues. My immediate supervisor made the job tolerable so experience can vary greatly. I would say if you are not a outgoing, friendly person this may not be the gig for you. I have an introverted personality and mustering up the will to be an outgoing people person everyday  took a lot out of me. Overall 7/10"
good,"Great place to work if you have a decent manager. It has a great culture and you can learn a lot by working cross functionally with other teams. "
good,I really enjoyed the family atmosphere of working here. I enjoyed the team and how was all worked together. What we provided for our guests each day was truly fun. To see someone's face light up when you solve their problem or get them the product of their dreams was what got me to work everyday.
good,"I liked working for them, however I did not feel like there was room for growth. Some managers played favorites as well. I would work for them if the opportunity comes again but it would never be my first choice...."
good,"Great management pay"
good,I really enjoyed working at Best Buy until they cut my hours to < 8 hours a week. My supervisor would constantly push off my requests to talk about more hours.
good,I worked there for only 5 months. The working environment in Langley warehouse is comfortable. Best Buy warehouse is good choice in case you prefer a less stress job.
good,Best Buy Management is fun and profitable... the culture is good and leadership very responsive.  If you follow the systems you will be successful and earn good money
good,I loved the project team.  We did remodels all the time.  The only issue was I was gone on the road a lot of the time.  This made home life very hard to maintain.
good,"yes, productive place and fun workplace and basketball court. Fantastic co-workers. There's day with pressure a lot of overtime 10-12 hours a day hard days but a good place to work. Specially when u get along with co-workers like I do its fun."
good,I really enjoyed my time working at Best Buy.  For me this was an in between job as I finished up my degree.  The people I worked with made the days go by fast and I will still remain in contact with them even through moving away.
good,"If you're looking to work with computers in any capacity, I would recommend working at Geek Squad for a year or two. The culture will be a pleasant surprise for you and you'll find a lot of people with interests similar to yours and you'll make new friends easily. You'll be running around as an agent (if you're store is a more busy location) but there's plenty of time to hang around and talk in between clients and other duties. It's pretty laid back as far as the management and ""getting in trouble"" goes but it's pretty stressful meeting their criteria and numbers."
good,"I loved working at BestBuy."
good,"As a full timer, the benefits are good for a retail company. Best Buy as a whole is a good company to work for, but on the store level the experience can vary greatly. Sometimes leadership team can get a little clique-ish, leaving any promotion openings for possible 'favorite employees' within the store. Overall, the work is enjoyable, the pay is reasonable, benefits are above average, opportunities are definitely available. I just don't wish to work retail forever."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I enjoyed my time at best buy. The culture and the people make it fun to work. A lot of corporate sponsored events and great employee discount. Opportunities to travel when you get promoted.
good,"I enjoyed my work at geek squad, with the exception of black friday. The other employees were very helpful, and it was easy to integrate myself into the job culture."
good,"While being somewhat cynical and harshly sarcastic toward customers when they are not around, it is a fun place to work where you can try to flex your selling skills."
good,"Best Buy was a great paying job. I hated that it got really boring sometimes. customer service and front end was the same job. we all just switched back and forth depending on the schedule. the one thing that bugged me the most was, my co- workers thought they could just just always stay at customer service cause they have been working there longer, even though the schedule said diffrent. other then that it was a great job."
good,"Working as a Best Buy Inventory Specialist is a strange experience, but not a bad one. If you enjoy being around technology, working with it, and wanting to learn more, but don't quite want to be selling any of it, then start at either Customer Service or as Inventory/Merchandising. While working as Inventory I have done everything from heavy lifting and installs with the Geek Squad teams to setting new price tags and picking up online orders. Its a comfortable position and the employees at the North Academy Store are pretty great to work with, especially (almost) all of the Management. Sometimes the hours will be a bit odd if you are part of the Warehouse team as either Inventory or Merchandising, mostly either early mornings or late hours depending, but it is good all around experience for Warehouse or Retail work."
good,Fun place when store manager wasn't involved. Good discount.  I work part time in the warehouse. I enjoyed the people I worked with in the backroom and on the salesfloor.
good,Great place to work if you don't mind people. Learned a lot about what a good workplace culture looks like there. The people you work with are the best part of the job.
good,"Learned social skills, by working with a large staff and dealing with customers"
good,"Along with the discounts that you get while working for the company, the culture drives the business. It was really great to be surrounded by co-workers that had a like-minded goal and attitude, to take care of the customer."
good,"Was a great place to work but was only seasonal,would help unload truck as and pick orders .forcklift certified ,also drove a stand up also a sit down forcklift"
good,"Helped customers with what they were looking for, sold them on accessories and service plans to protect their products.  did inventory counts, scheduling and hiring events.  Plannograms and resets when needed, as well as truck stocking."
good,"Best Buy was a great step between school for me. It wasn't a great job, but I created some long lasting networking connections within a large company and have kept in touch when available. I worked in a small county with in Texas, and found that most of the people who worked there were friendly and courteous, and the management team was great."
good,I really dont have time to write a full review. Not a bad place to work. It has drastically changed since I worked there however. New management and store layout.
good,"I learned a lot from this company, in the technology field. I learned a ton about how to interact with customer, and sell. Management was fantastic here. It was like a video game, and we were in it to win it, and achieve our sales goals, in a fun & positive way. The hardest part of this job, was keeping up consistently with ever evolving technology. The most enjoyable part about this job, was the recognition you received for doing a great job, and hearing about it from upper management, with a handshake, and kind words."
good,Good place to work under the leadership. However they say they promote from within but everytime i applied to go full time the spots were given to people who use to work at Best Buy but had left the company and were trying to get back into the company.
good,Working at best buy these two years has done so much for me. I not only grew with the company I grew as a person. The team there really feels welcoming and best buy is non-commissioned so there is less stress of sales getting stolen.
good,I had a good experience working for them. I enjoyed the work atmosphere and my coworkers. The only reason i left was a better job opportunity. I still use this store to this day.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"This company is great but ultimately has their own profit in mind. I can't blame them for that but they hire people who cannot fill the position. Instead, they promote people from within that have no qualification to save money. Still, it is a good company to work for that has many opportunities but good luck advancing."
good,"SWAT's count the store inventory.  Depending on how well the store is organized can determine the level of stress.  The awesome thing about the position is that it's Monday - Friday, off on weekends (except for Physical inventory and occasional store meetings). Communicating with leadership plays a big role as well."
good,"It was fun while working at best buy, i can say it's 1 of the best jobs i've had. It has a great culture and mostly everybody tends to get along. Management can be improved, favoritism needs to lower down."
good,"Workplace with high productivity goals. Even on ""slow"" days ton of work to do, anywhere from testing products to answering phone calls. Overall enjoyable mostly due to diligent co-workers, but tiering in the long run due to lack of help/coverage. Can often be stress-full, especially on and around holidays, but due to pleasant co-workers willing to share the burden, can be manageable."
good,"best buy is a very good place to work as a student, flexible hours and great management. Due to it being non-commission sales there is a lot less pressure and relationships with coworkers are formed easier."
good,"Best Buy marked the beginning of my career and was an excellent beginning point. Recommend to anyone in a similar situation. I particularly enjoyed the hard work that management put into the job, they genuinely seemed to care about the people and tried to make the environment better for all employees."
good,"Excellent coworkers, great environment, flexible schedule ."
good,"I worked mobile sales goals and metrics are to be met everyday, one one one training and coaching  are given weekly if metrics not hit. If your good at interacting with customers its a fun place to work. Great discounts on products and services. Culture there is great."
good,"Good cafeteria, freindly worj environment, very fast paced, not allowed to sit, must be willing to work hard and stand a lot. No phones were allowed in the warehouse so breaks were pretty boring"
good,"I have been working at this establishment for the past three years. As a sales representative, I do a lot of interaction with the public that is valuable for any company."
good,"This is a hard job to keep when you have low sales even though its non commission ,but the people are fun to help with sales, and employees get along great"
good,"Certain things are going to not be great about a job, you won't notice some of the benefits until you leave. Progression and growth is all about favoritism at this time, but it was not before."
good,"Best Buy is very competitive, training is easy but they want high percentages in revenue, protection plans and credit card applications. I learned to be outspoken and the proper way to respectfully talk to the customer to get through the transaction smoothly. They have 45 minute breaks for 6 hours or more and optional 15 minute breaks for less than 6 hours."
good,"Not a terribly difficult job. Inconsistent hours. Very flexible. Moving up in the company is easy if you're *super* dedicated. What company expects is not the same as what is actually possible most of the time. Large pressure on sales numbers. Overall, a great starting job if you're trying to gain experience. Not a great long term job if you're not able to move up in the company or have any motivation to."
good,They are a well organized and have daily goals to be met. A very friendly environment to work in. Motivates a friendly environment and have team meetings daily.
good,"Depending on how the people around you are, it can be a good place to work. The employee attitude really shapes the work day. Managment styles change from store to store, sometimes you get a really proactive manager, other times you get a more reactionary style manager. The Hardest part of the job is having to interact with customers and their complaints."
good,"The job was great and the people are great. Very nice environment, who wouldn’t like to be around electronics all day ? Only problem I had at the time is I needed full time and I couldn’t get that right off the bat."
good,Management will work with you. Will give you days off. Fast paced work environment. Competitive and outgoing employees. Have goals to reach on the daily.
good,the work enviroment was good and interesting everyday to go into work. You deal with different situation and you are always stay busy even when theres down time.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Great people, great clients, great products and the best staff."
good,"It is an environment where you don't work on commission, but you are coached and trained around it as if you are. The only thing that sucks is that you have to deal with having great numbers and not really reaping any benefit from it. I think the management is great but really it just depends on what store you are at, because I have had friends that have been really miserable with management. There is high turnover, but that is because if you aren't performing they will performance manage you out of your position."
good,"Great team environment. I don't believe employees are payed the amount they should be paid,but then again, I would not go as far as to say that Best Buy is a career, unless you're in upper management."
good,"The company’s motto is to have fun while being the best. Best Buy invests in training all employees to excel in their job titles and provides ample opportunity to advance. Since it is retail, Best Buy is numbers driven, meaning that there are Key Performance Indicators that translate into monthly goals for you to meet. Not meeting them over a long period of time can result in write ups, and can ultimately result in a poor annual review (no raise) or even termination. I’ve been through several different stores as I have transferred to move into other positions, and the one thing that I can say is that the associates in each store were like a tight-knit family and did what they could to help others do their best at their jobs. Again, going back to retail, the nature of the beast requires you to be available days, nights, and weekends. A consistent schedule and weekends off is not likely (especially in a full-time position), but management does its best to be as flexible as they expect their staff to be."
good,Great for those just starting out to gain real world experience. Work hard and reap the rewards. The managers are what makes this job great in my opinion. Some lazy co workers can make it more stressful.
good,Best Buy gave me the opportunity to get a taste of electronics. I enjoy working at BB. I was in the HT dept and I believe it was easy to talk about TV's. I didn't have trouble understanding the concept of how each TV works differently. The management was great. Workplace culture is awesome you see people of variety different backgrounds. The hardest part of the job was selling a Big TV.
good,Best buy was a fun job. I learned alot from them. It was a good atmosphere as well. I learned how to interact with customers and how to really sell merchandise.
good,"I suppose it depends on the location, but more hours would be great because that is the only issue really for me, but I suppose that is based on rev which is understandable."
good,I worked at Best Buy in high school. I really enjoyed working there and if it weren't for my school schedule then I would have remained employed there longer.
good,The Best Buy in West Vancouver has a very friendly and nice environment with good management. You have a very good discounts as an employee on products which you seek to buy.
good,"working for best buy can be really fun and benefiting it comes with perks like tuition reimbursement sometimes flexible hours and good benefits, but working in the retail industry for so long can get very over done and you can end up having a lower tolerance for customer than you use to. It is more fun and enjoyable as long as the management helps make it that way."
good,"I like working at GeekSquad it's as if I have my own company at my desk. I am experienced and allowed to resolve L1 and L2  issiues quickly. "
good,Best Buy is practically the last man standing in the Retail field of electronics and smart appliances and tech. It is a great place to learn and grow.
good,"Very laid back and relaxed. Good management that allows you to learn and work on your own. Staff members were fun. However, the pay was subpar and the health benefits were lacking."
good,"everyone feels like family there, we help each other out when we can. we work together as one functioning unit, each department works as a group.if one person doesn't know the answer there is no doubt that someone else in the store wont."
good,"Worked at local warehouse. Even though we had a very productive facility and crew, they decided to close the warehouse. Our facility was a good example of how a team based culture can be enjoyable and goal driven at the same time."
good,Never to busy always fun and enthusiastic colleagues. Learned a lot of tech and what different brands do  differently. hardest part of the job must be boxing day but its one day and worth it
good,Loved the importance of working as a team. Great management and scheduling.  Hardest part of the job was the holidays and later house.  I learned hose to connect with customers and how to help the department out
good,I enjoy the people I work with. Learned a lot about technology. Working in the warehouse is tough work. Heavy lifting is required and  shipment days can have you working 8+ hours.
good,"I have worked in multiple positions and found they can be fun while still productive, and if desired there is room for professional growth in the company."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I work in a very fast passed challenging environment. Assisting clients with technology needs and making sure everything is finished in a timely manner.
good,This is a great place to work as a young person starting out as they tend toward hiring people who don’t have a lot of other things to do each day. Advancement is available frequently and the benefits are great for 401K. Health benefits were lacking with United Healthcare.
good,Aside from the sales goals that you're expected to meet which are plausible with most days the company was enjoyable for the most part. Good perks for associates while I was working there.
good,You will work holidays and weekends. You can have a really busy day or a really slow day. I worked in mobile and had so much fun selling phones! Monthly Bonuses and PTO. The Job is retail and you will have to sell!
good,"Best Buy by far has the best retail working environment of any retailer i have worked for. They put their customers and employees first, investing everything into training, development, and resources for their employees to be the experts in their positions."
good,"The work life balance is good at Best buy. The staff are there to help you. Everyone was nice and welcoming, The employees treat you as there own from day one. There is a sense of community. However, the management needs to be restructured."
good,"Great place to work as a second job or while in school. Hours are flexible but dont plan to support a family on the wage. This is of course retail and the big money is in management. So unless you plan on staying a few years before moving up, don't put all your eggs in one basket here. Fun, stress free environment with lots of friends and relationships to make here."
good,Retail is a constantly changing environment. If you are flexible this is the job for you and what better company than Best Buy to work for. You must work hard here but the reward is worth it.
good,Working at Best Buy was fun because of the people I worked. We all shared a competitive nature and wanted our store to be the best. Working in home solutions was my favourite because it was a job where I could literally talk about video games and tv's the whole time.
good,"The pay is decent and if you want to develop your sales skills with limited pressure this job may be ok. The problem is it isn't commission based. This is important not only because you get paid less, but because future sales employers will not value this as sales experience as highly."
good,"Best Buy provided me with a great opportunity to get a variety of experience in many different areas. Best Buy lacks in the pay and benefits department, but makes up for it with a killer discount. No matter what type of job you are looking for, Best Buy probably has something for you."
good,"Working at Best Buy can be fun and enjoyable, but this is heavily dependent on your store GM and store leadership. Corporate campus culture is great, as they promote personal and professional growth, as well as making sure store teams have the necessary tools to execute on the job. The hardest part is making sure sales associates remain engaged and are aligned with corporate communication on a daily basis. Again, this is also dependent on the leadership at the store level."
good,"Work in best buy is as it is, work. But experience in the work place depends, in what department you are put yourself in. In the warehouse you have yourself a team working team that want unison and hard work. On the floor their maybe respectful employees that love help and also are kind, but there is allot of employees that are like sharks who get ""vicious"" when they see their sale get ""stolen"" and start creating gossip between other employees trying to put you in a bad spot before the management even notices. Pay is fair and hours were good. But being between "" fun hard working"" employees can be a dice roll. So usually when you do work try yo not speak to other get close to the employees as much as possible till you ensure that they are good people."
good,"A Nice Productive Work Environment, Management is good, gets busier during end of the year, other times a pleasant place to work and learn new technologies and do your best."
good,"It's a good company especially as a student or contract position, but they don't often hire more people unless someone has left the company because there are very few positions within each store.  Pay is usually minimum wage or just above if you are lucky.  I had a good group of coworkers so we had fun working together.  Because a lot of the hires are contract, job security is a bit tough."
good,"I started Best Buy when I began college and it was a great job. They work with your school schedule. You can move up within leadership if you want too, as long as you work for it."
good,"Great place to start out. Excellent part-time job, decent wages for work. If you love electronics you'll love working here. Promotion opportunities are everywhere and great if you want to relocate."
good,"ive basically ended up homeless due to best buy not keeping their word and transferring me to a new store in a new state that i was moving to. I was hoping to keep all the great benefits and not have to go job searching all over again. but, 40 Best Buy applications later, im still searching."
good,I would work there agin if they Up my pay and gave more hours  unless it’s more for a young kid with no  responsibilities  because I was only making 11.50 an hour and i has a kid at the time so it just wasn’t enough for me then they wouldn’t give me many hours
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The job was pretty fun, great people to work with. The bad thing is that the hours can change randomly, enjoy working weekends and split shift as those happened constantly, and it's retail so obviously black Friday is a con. They start earlier every year not giving their workers time for thanksgiving with family."
good,I’ve been with best buy for two years I love the atmosphere and the people there make me feel like family. I don’t like the fact that I’ve been there for two years and promised promotion with no foreseeable future of it happening
good,"Los días laborales son muy divertidos, aprendí el trato con los clientes y a cobrar."
good,work hours are good during season cuts down slowly after that. its a good job if your going to school. Management isn't always the greatest but their are some people make up for it all.
good,"Great in store discount to employees. Sales environment is fun and competitive, many different areas to work in. Good customers for the most part, and team members usually great people too."
good,Great place to work and learn about the new technology available. Mainly looked after the orders that came in for pickups and orders that needed to be shipped. Opportunity to be on the floor at times to inform customers about certain products.
good,The job was nice. The managers actually cared about the employees and the majority of my co-workers were really nice. Then job isn't too difficult and the majority of it comes to dealing with customers in some form. I really liked this job while I was here. Only reason I left was because my life required me to get a higher paying job.
good,"Fast paced, but always fun to work at learn about new technology as it comes out. Great company to work for. Good balance of work life and family life"
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Best Buy. It was only temporary while I finished school, and that is as far as I can recommend it. Advancement is extremely difficult an saturated."
good,"Best Buy is a great company to work for, ;unfortunately the hours are giving very sparingly. If you are looking for something part time to be able to go to school then this is the job for you. If you need hours, you might have to reconsider."
good,There is always stress in today market place to achieve company goals and Best Buy is no exception. It was fun to work there and the people I worked for and around were great. I was able to learn and grow within the company in my 20 years there I had many different roles and enjoyed learning each one. It was a career not just a job for me.
good,Coworkers are fun. sometimes management is not the best. Great learning environment in regards to product knowledge and learning to deal with the tougher customers. There are definitely some perks to working here.
good,"In will not be providing a review at this time.  However, Best Buy is great place to work and would encourage anyone that is interested in Consumer Electronics to apply."
good,"Typical day at work? "
good,Best buy is a great job. It has a lot of room for growth if you are able to move around in the company. The coworkers all work together as a team and even come off as somewhat family oriented. The breaks are only 30 minutes which doesn't give you much time get food and eat. The health care doesn't help that much with healthcare becoming so expensive
good,"There was always teamwork involved which was enjoyed. You will not be able to work here if you are not a team player or a great leader. The staff was always friendly, but as most of the familiar staff relocated I did so as well."
good,Best Buy is a Decent place to work. However it is primarily a retail Store and very sales focused. The culture is decent and mostly the management is decent. There is alot of paperwork involved for an electronics store...
good,The people you work with are pretty great. The management for my department changed three-four time since ive been there and never received proper training
good,"Good place to work in, great team I had in the position I was in, store discounts were pretty good, management was fun to work with and have within, works with your schedule"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"This is a job for a high school student, college student or something to do on the side. It has the opportunity to grow, but with anything in the working world, it won't be overnight success. Put in the time and you will be rewarded for your contributions."
good,"BB is a chill place to work with great discounts. If you are looking for a normal hourly retail job and buy electronics often, it's hard to beat. If you do well you can advance but you need to do consistently well."
good,"The job position was fairly easy  just cash customers out and clean your area and stock snacks. Had to try to get customers to sign up for Membership, Credit Card or Geek Squad Insurance. Each employee has a monthly min goal for those categories. Main problem I had was just the standing up for a long time and usually only one cashier in the front open and the rest of the customer service team in the customer service circle for returns and pick ups. It gets lonely up there and half the time if you was busy you would not get your 15min break if you work more then 4 hours but less then 6."
good,"Overall a great part-time job only, a fun place to work. Bonuses during the holidays just hated the holidays hours. Pay was great for a part-time job, nonetheless."
good,The continuing need to learn about new technology made the job way less boring. The security needed for asset protection made job harder but it was necessary.
good,"My location is a good place to learn so many thing in IT. we usually start at 7:45 and end at 4:15."
good,"Loved the culture, it was pretty low stress and fun. "
good,Best Buy has an awesome culture and offers great sales training for entry level candidates. Working was great but it was often competitive when it came down to your sales numbers.
good,"Working at Best buy was both a challenging, yet great work experience. There are opportunities for growth within the various departments and chances for you to grow personally. I would recommend this job to anyone who desires to gain experience in retail."
good,I’ve been with Best Buy for the last 10 years and it has been a great experience however because it is a retail company there are limited opportunities
good,Good company with some good benefits but pay is very low and there is no commission. Managers will stress that you hit your sales goals but there is very little incentive to surpass these standards.
good,Loved all of the training and efficiency. Treats employees fairly. Only complaint is the compensation- I felt as if I should have gotten bigger raises.
good,Days at best were busy but things were organized. The employees were of all ages and backgrounds and brought something new to the work place. Overall i enjoyed my time at best buy.
good,it is fun and working with electronic devices which is so exciting and having fun with them. The management team was really good and the care about people who work therw.
good,I learned how to engage with customers on a personal level. Create amazing experiences for the consumer to keep coming back to the store. Staff lounge is always stocked with snacks and refreshments.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Best Buy generally. As with all retail positions, the hours were long and compensation was less than the effort required. My Best Buy location management treated me fairly and was as accommodating as possible. Advancement is difficult and the money is not as good as it could be."
good,I loved my time at Geek Squad when the culture was at its healthiest.  It is a great place to get started in the IT industry and I loved the satisfaction of helping people get their computer working again.  I wasn't too interested in getting promoted to a management position as then I would have to deal with only the angry people and constantly put out fires and seemingly endless amounts of paperwork.  I wouldn't get to work on computers anymore.  So I was content staying at the Consultation Agent level until I got my career job elsewhere.  I still would like to go back part time and help out as it really is a fun place with great people to work with.
good,"The employees are all very upbeat and willing to help you learn anything when you're just starting. People generally are very willing to help out a fellow employee as well, even the managers."
good,"Well, it's retail.  The culture is always wonderful because individuals get to joke about how terrible customers can be.  One day you're doing nothing all day, wherein the next you're super busy.  I myself was at the top in my store/district/market, but no matter how hard I tried, getting a raise was super minimal or non existent.  There is no point in working hard unless you have a real shot of moving up.... but then, when you think about it, unless you plan on moving up in the corporate ladder, what're you really doing in a retail store? You cannot make a career in retail.  At some point you will be let go if you don't quit yourself, or you're one of very few to climb."
good,"Coworkers are usually pretty friendly, but customers are terrible at Geek Squad and definitely don't understand the services we do. Management is fine but they don't understand Geek Squad Culture"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Job was fun, management was great, customers are difficult but easy to get over. Environment is youthful and exciting. Hours were decent, and pay was decent."
good,"Good place for students, good work dynamic . Flexible schedule, good team work, ability to learn and advance easily no matter in what department you work"
good,Fun atmosphere with a generally young employee age. It could be a mad house at times (i.e. black friday) but it was face paced and exciting. Most coworkers are a pleasure to work with.
good,"your typical part time retail job, really flexible with scheduling most of the time. Most of the time its always the people you work with makes it the most enjoyable, but the work and customers are the most annoying."
good,"Good place to work if you are good at sales. fair pay. cool coworkers for the most part. great discount and benefits. sales goals can be a pain, but overall not that bad."
good,I enjoyed my time at Best Buy but the company was much different when I started working there and when I left.  I'm not sure what the culture is like in the stores at this time.  I hardly have a reason to visit or shop.
good,"typical job duties were selling products, helping customers, keeping work area clean, and occasionally doing odds and ends. the managers were friendly, but also work minded and were very good at their jobs. my coworkers were knowledgeable about products, and knew how to cater to each individual customer. the hardest part of the job was dealing with problem customers, which was not a very common thing. my favorite part of the job was being able to work in an area that i was already knowledgeable and passionate about."
good,"your typical day would be clocking in on a computer and sticking around your assigned department making sure everything looks good and clean, but always keeping the customer first in mind. Hours and advantages within the company are based on sales and what you can up-sell with products such as warranties, accessories, etc."
good,"Started off in the home theater dept, which I enjoyed due to audio and video products.  I then transferred to car audio; another position I enjoyed, but still would assist in home theater.  After being in the store for about 8 months I was asked by the Loss Prevention Supervisor if I would like his position; he was gettin promoted and wanted someone he felt would do a good job taking his place - so i did.  Was Loss Prevention Sup for about 4 years and was later asked by Store Manager how would I feel about taking over the Delivery Team - there had been issues with damages and customer complaints - so I did.  Took over as Delivery Sup and things became much better for the delivery team."
good,The employees are very welcoming. It’s very easy to move up within the company. You get tons of very useful benefits as a full-timer and there’s a lot of training that you have to go through to be prepared to be on the sales floor.
good,Best Buy has stunned me with how amazing of an environment they provide their employees with.  Very upbeat and fun environment to work in and very flexible hours.
good,Management could have been more direct and more involved with the employees and their needs and being able to have a better on board training process to make the new hires feel more conformable and welcoming to the team
good,"Good company to work for, good benefits and competitive pay. Started there at the bare bottom and would like to think i somewhat moved up. However some upper management seem to pick and choose sides, and if you pick wrong. You're at a dead end. Got to be a actor, athlete, and a politician to win there."
good,Great for those who want a part-time entry level to retail while in college or fresh out of high school. If you're interested in new age technology this is the place for you!
good,"Fun place to work. You make friendships and the job is relatively interesting. It does get stressful during the holiday season. The discount is good on certain items. Overall, it's a good job during college but not many people make a career out of it. At least my opinion."
good,"It was an exciting and challenging place to work. There are a lot of managers that come and go, and most recently they mainly care about nothing but numbers. This makes the environment very cut throat and stressful. They do not give you much leeway as a person in an upper level position to have a work life balance. And anything that has to do with advancement it is only with sales. If you are like me and want a different career path, they tell you can not do it until you are a General Manager of a store. There is a culture committee that strives to make the job better and with the right people in place it is a job you can be happy with."
good,This is a great place to start building a career. They give you so many tools to help you succeed and best of all you control your destiny in Best Buy.
good,Great place to work. Good benefits outside of medical and things of that nature. Management is either for you or against you. High volume of customers so some times of the day it is very busy while others you're not doing anything so that can be a little trying.
good,"I enjoyed working at Best Buy because there were always things to do.  People to assist, projects to complete and products to learn.  Managers were always uplifting and encouraging."
good,"I enjoyed meeting new customers, getting along with my co-workers, learning about different electronics, working on black Friday, feeling comfortable,making friends with my co-workers."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Great place to work at for part time. Corporate culture is very good as well. Management is not bad. I loved helping people out and making sure they found the best fit product for them.
good,Always work to be done and not boring. Learned a lot. Management is great - no micromanaging and positive. Good communication between co-workers - respectful and helpful. Company is too big and the complexity is difficult to learn - In spite of being able to ask questions you're really on your own.  They need a better review process. Job security seems arbitrary. Best part is all the perks on campus and friendly co-workers.
good,Not a bad place to work.  Just political when it comes to promotions.  If you didn't fit into the one clique in my store then you basically had no opportunity to move up in the company without transferring to another store.
good,Best Buy is a fun place to work. I would not consider this long term employment. Had lots of fun working there because management would make it fun and have events for employees. I love that they volunteer in the community.
good,"amazing people to work with, and they actually care, strong management, plenty of training, wish there was a full time position for my career path, overall, very good."
good,"Store to store basis my managers were not great, it was a small store so it was a little like high school with the gossiping and cliques that formed. Other than that they really work with your schedule and they don't have the worst pay."
good,"The most I enjoyed about best buy is to use my knowledge and expertise helping customers find the product they need for everyday life such as computers, routers,and smart devices."
good,"Best Buy is not somewhere you would want to stay for long-term employment. The job itself is easy, however, they micromanage more than I'd prefer. You will work inconsistent shifts, but they are fair in how they choose schedules."
good,this job is loaded with great people to wokr with one thing i do hvae to say is that advancing in this job is very hard since at times they play the favortism card alot so that is one thing to look out for
good,"Not a bad place to get your foot in the door, it is retail but, it did get me a better job down the road. Only real downside is advancement. It takes a long time to get to where you want to be depending on the store/location."
good,Worked 10+ years until store was closed this October. Enjoyed the community feel and employee ownership of the store. I worked on average 9 hours per shift.
good,Most of my experience has been good even though I was a temp. My co-workers were one of a kind and management was as well. It was a pleasure. Would love to work there again.
good,Typical day consist of helping customers find products and services. I learn about sales. The overall culture easy going. Best buys moto is have fun while being the best. Hardest part of the job is conflict resolution. Most enjoyable part is working with peers.
good,It's a great company to work for as long as the store you're working in is what Best Buy is supposed to be. Advancement within the company seems to be rare. Be wary of becoming a valued member in your department for that could possibly kill your chances at advancing through the company
good,Working at Best Buy was really straight-forward. I would ring up people and try to sell them a warranty on the item that they were purchasing. The employee discount was one of the best discounts that I know out there right now. Everyone is usually always happy and uplifting. Everybody helps each-other and keeps a smile on their face. The hardest part of the job was definitely keeping up with the numbers. I needed to sell a certain amount of warranties in order to keep Best Buy satisfied.
good,"Anytime during the week, depending on which department you work in, it can be quite busy. The weekends brings in the most traffic.Have an open personality and things should go smooth. The managers communicate really well with employees."
good,The business has a very fast paced environment that allows for a large array of interpersonal communication both with customers and coworkers. For the most part there is a feel of respect and dignity in the company which highly encourages everyone to always give their all everyday.
good,As a company I have really enjoyed working for Best Buy. They offered tons of benefits and options to develop and advance. I would love to continue working for this company however I can no longer work the hours required in retail.
good,"Really nice people, sad pay and not much room for advancement, but at least the pay is more than minimum wage. The environment is very lay back at times, so the job is not too stressful."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Great place to start at. Can be busy and stressful durring holiday season due to client flow through the store. Great culture with GeekSquad! Management is great and awesome to work with.
good,"No commission requirements. Learn great customer service and retail experience. One of the better Retail environments you can work at."
good,Company's culture and work ethic are pretty amazing. I loved the fact that I was able to get the latest scoop on new technology and got to learn a lot about sales and efficient customer service. Overall a great experience in terms of the job itself.
good,Great atmosphere but lacks extra hours to make ends meet. Would like to work there full time. And management are open with workers availabilities and schedule.
good,"wonderful, amazing, learning experience. from the customer service to the roles of learning how the company works. For a retail job as I said has to be on of the best recommended."
good,"Overall, Best Buy is a great company to work for. You get awesome discounts on a large variety of products and services which makes it  really hard not to spend your entire paycheck on products. Store management can either be a hit or a miss depending on the location."
good,"For retail Best Buy is a great place to work.  Retail can be stressful and have terrible hours but the people I worked with on a regular basis made it all worth it.  You will be active and on your feet for long periods of time and must be able to think on your feet.  No 2 days are alike and lots of bonding happens after the doors are locked,  I consider the people I worked with there my family"
good,Best Buy is a great company all in all. They place you in position to learn everything about the products they sell to offer you an advantage on the sales floor and stock room. I've learned to adjust work with all types of personalities and temperaments. I enjoy the close knit atmosphere as well as managements attempts to keep it that way.
good,"You go through most of your day diagnosing and troubleshooting computers. You deal with a lot of customer on a daily basis, and learn how to deal with them. I loved getting to solve issues and learn about all the new technology."
good,"Best Buy is a very fast paced, very high volume, and very fun place to work. The team is extremely energetic and knowledgeable. Working with customers is energizing and fun and my coworkers made it a very enjoyable environment to work in. Every employee is expected to know enough about each department in the store to help close a sale. This often leads to people rotating throughout the store to help each other out when their assigned department is slow. Overall, even during the holiday season (i.e. Black Friday) the job never feels overwhelming  because of the support the rest of the store offers. My biggest complaints would be the long hours on your feet, the potential late night hours and 9+ hour shifts (typical of most retail stores), and the highly competitive nature of a retail sales environment. If you do not like pushing credit cards and up-selling customers, this job may not be for you. If you do like talking with customers and helping them find the best product for their needs, this is an excellent place to work."
good,"Lots of room for advancement if you so choose, great warehouse leadership, fun place to be, great benefits, not hard work but if you're up for a solid day's work for a solid day's pay, you'll enjoy it there."
good,"It's been a while since I worked for Best Buy, But my time there is well remembered.  Employee discount was amazing, and employees were treated fairly for their level of production."
good,filled with a lot of collaborative team work. departments looked out for each other and constantly helped each other out to obtain store goals. friendly environment with great moral
good,"Best Buy Canada has an amazing ideal of Value based leadership which is second to none.  The company promotes fairness and equity, and is known to unleash the power of it's people."
good,"Working at Best Buy was a great experience though the hours being not fixed was an issue. As a part time job this sufficed as there were no commissions, the stress of making sales was not overwhelming."
good,"Last Holiday season I was a merchandising person.  This year I took a position as Sales Consultant.  I am a seasonal, on-call employee."
good,Worked Part Time while in college as a computer sales specialist.  Hours were flexible with my schedule and the management was great.  Sometimes the schedule was a little wonky.
good,In the short time that I worked there I learned a lot and would definitely say it’s a good place for a first job. Benefits are okay however job advancement is rare. Hours would be cut depending on revenue. But overall still a fun experience and great people to work with.
good,"Slow mornings very fast paced at lunch and nights on the weekends."
good,I enjoyed working at BestBuy. The people that worked there were very supportive and positive on a day to day basis. The schedule was typically consistent on which days and hours you worked which was nice. The only thing I did not like was that weekends were mandatory.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy has a lot to teach depending on which department you work in. It's a really relaxed and cultural organization. You go to work knowing that adequate people are hired for the role, so you don't need to worry about working with just anyone. It is a well diverse workplace with a mix of genders, religions, ethnicity's and age groups."
good,"Best Buy offers a great 50% discount, so it's a great place for tech enthusiasts. Black Friday here is extremely organized and not as daunting as other companies. I had a nice experience here as a holiday employee, I'm not as well informed with the company because I was only a temporary hire."
good,"Working on the floor was quick paced. As soon as you walk into the store, you are stopped by customers asking for assistance. The job was fulfilling because you get to interact with many people."
good,I saved the company over $1000 worth of products from being stolen and I was given only 2 awards and $25 worth of certificates to spend in store. Management will let you go if you do your job and there is no one to back you up even if you are in the right.
good,"Best Buy provides employees with sufficient trianing thru their training network. Best Buy employees are friendly in general. However, it is a fast-paced working environment, employee needs to work smart to catch-up with all the training materials, and new products everyday to consult precisely to the customers. Best Buy is a cool working place."
good,"Depending on what store you work at, you can either have an incredible amount of fun or no fun at all.  You get a raise once a year based on a scale from 0-5 and your manager will ask you what number you think you'd fall under.  If its a higher number than they think, they'll make it seem like you're a terrible employee and give you about a 20 cent raise.  No other chances to get a raise, unless your promoted.  about 8/10 managers show extreme favoritism, from promotions, less expectations, longer breaks.  Management only cares about getting monthly bonus's which for them minimum in the thousands, while you'll get about 50-100 bucks.  Bonus's are met through store selling goals, so most of the time management will raise the goal above the companies set goal without telling the employees.  If you don't meet that specific managers goal, even if you're making the company goal specifically meant for your store, you'll be written up pretty much every week till you meet the fake goal, scheduled early mornings for ""sales school"" which is just the manager asking why you can't hit your goal.  They don't look at foot traffic, so if your store is dead which most days, expect from the months of September-January when you're busy, they'll just tell you its because you suck."
good,"Great place to work if you love retail, great discounts, friendly management, must work holidays and weekends (required if you're full time) but if you do not care about working holidays and weekends, its the place to be if you love to sell technology and dealing with the public."
good,"Good place to work but, good employee discounts, the only thing most employees don't like is there are no benefits, contracts sometimes never get renewed and it takes years to be a full-time employee at best buy."
good,I️ love working here it just isn’t paying me enough nor giving me the hours I️ want. The management kinda picks favorites as far as moving people up I worked there from August 2015 until February 2016 and quit. Then came back in August 2016 and been there ever since and it’s the same problem of low pay and not being able to move up.
good,"It was a long time ago and my memories of the job are typical for and administrative assistant for Vice President of a large corporation.  Organized their travel, paid expenses, prepared reports."
good,"I like electronics and working at Best Buy with my business skills, was a good first experience. But I wasn't really trained for my sales position, only in the warehouse. It was somewhat frustrating to not know details about what you're selling, and customers ask you so many questions. But at least I sold a lot of products, and I feel like I did great, along side some of the nice employees there."
good,Best Buy was great place to work! Management was always taking care of the employees buy doing employee appreciation events and pot lucks where everyone in the store would participate.
good,Working here is relaxed they try to make it as fun as possible they are very understanding in terms of needing time off and makin it up another day. They also give great discounts on many of the item's they sell which is a plus. This is a good place for someone to start working and there are many opportunities to move up if you put the time in.
good,"Best Buy was probably one of the better jobs I've had, given that my daily tasks dealt with technology, which as a techy is amazing. My only complaint was the cutback in available hours during the summer months, due to so many people working there."
good,"It was a challenging position and I greatly enjoyed it.  I was given great freedom due to my background in retail and operations.  I was only doing this while I was in school pursuing my degree.  The management team ensured a good work life balance in regards to school and I appreciate that a great deal,"
good,Best buy is a nice place to work. There is on line training. You can learn as much as you want about the products and store. Best buy is a great store for the customer to gain knowledge of the products. I found the management very helpful and understanding.
good,"Best Buy is one of the few retailers that actually has a strong presence in the community, with good resistance to online competition. I feel that job security is pretty good with this company overall and that their price match policies, expert service, and niche make this possible."
good,I learned to walk up to strangers and talk to them. I enjoyed being able to help people and being knowledgeable about what I was selling. I didn't enjoy being pressed by some management to harass the same customers over and over again if they needed help.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Very positive and vibrant environment. Love working with people, helping others achieve their goals, Helping customers with the best of our abilities, and been the leading electronics company."
good,"Very fun place to be and easy to excel. Had fun with everyone, but your team will regularly change due to new hires and people accepting more desirable jobs."
good,"Fun place to work, and I enjoyed the customers. I loved seeing all of the new merch and learning about how to use and sell things. I was a star employee, and made many sells, and won contests, Only drawback is the salary...it is pretty low, but all around fun place to work."
good,"Anyone who's worked retail, it's just like that. If you're into cutting edge tech, talking to people about, and helping them figure out solutions based on their needs this is the place for you."
good,Best Buy was a good atmosphere to work in based on the positions I was in. Management promoted a positive means of growth within your role and pushed to have you take on more responsibilities without it being overwhelming. Proper resources were always allocated to help achieve goals.
good,"Overall a good and fun place to work as long as you enjoy what you are selling. Good business hours, not open super early or really late. Decent traffic so can keep yourself busy helping people."
good,"working at best buy was a good time, my managers were all very competent people and knew that life happens and we can't win every day. They had a great attitude towards us as workers and paid us fairly. The store I worked at had a very competitive attitude as we were all encouraged to be the top of the sales chart. We all were expected to learn everything possible about our areas."
good,"great temp job while in school, pay was low, no benefits or 401k, hours were always different every work week, part time hours. management took well care of employees with monthly hang out parties, like bowling or dinner"
good,"best buy actually took the time to teach you about what you had to sell, and they taught you a good amount as well, all the basics were taught well with helpful videos and quizzes"
good,This company has a really fun and embracing work environment. The managers did a lot to show appreciation to the whole team.The events set up to improve team efforts we fun and well thought out.
good,They provided/required training for all products sold. This is how all employees are so knowledgeable of all the products. Your only limit on this knowledge is our own fault. Those trainings were informative and easy to follow.
good,"great place to work but after some time you realize what it had made those around you into and you look at yourself and say ""thats not what i want to become"" if it was not for the amazing team in my own store best buy would have never been as good as it was. my own store was the literal best of the best in terms of people performance and culture. and even then i see myself looking beyond the doors for the next opportunity"
good,"It was an alright job, nothing that will blow your socks off, but not bad at all. I was promoted several time based off of work ethic and prior knowledge but ended up leaving to finish my masters degree."
good,"Honestly, I loved my job there. It was a great place to work for quite a while. I was convinced that I would have better opportunities for advancement by moving to a store that is roughly an hour commute. After 2 years and some dishonest shuffling of employees I decided that despite having a great culture, discount and group of friends there, I simply am not compensated enough for the effort and drive time I put in for a retail position. "
good,"Fun environment. Everyone is very relaxed and nice, but the money just isn't there. If your more competent than others you recieve more responsibility but are not paid more which is a frustration."
good,Best buy is a good job for college students that are just looking to earn extra cash but it is hard to advance and the hours are not great. i found myself working late a lot.
good,i find it very satisfying whenever me and my team will go to an customers house and install entertainment system and new television for customers and they would be very pleased with what we have done.
good,"It is a great place to start off to gain skills and work experience for the future. If you enjoy being around a staff that supports your goals and is considerate towards your education, this is the place for you."
good,its a decent place during college.  I was laid off from a great paying job and this one filled some of the gaps until I finished classes.  Its a decent place
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,It was a fun a place. A lot of change since I left. Don't know what it is like now. But we were a team. Had meetings and store team builders every month.
good,"This is an amazing company to work for, they really value their employees. This company is great for anyone not looking to enjoy being at work. Very demanding, sometimes stressful environment."
good,"All of the employee's are insanely nice and I love and respect them all, but the managers always seemed to have their own hidden agenda that they didn't share with anyone and it kinda creeped me out."
good,"Best Buy is a good company. However, If you don't have a passion for selling and aren't good hitting a sales goal then this isn't the job for you. Management can be great most of the time, supervisors can be a pain."
good,"I don't have anything to add about my experience at Best Buy.  Overall, it's been a very good place to work.  My reason for pursuing other opportunities has more to do with the climate in MN more than anything else."
good,"Geat part time place to work, the hours are really flexible, the pay is  a little bit above minimum wage. The staff is wonderful, great atmosphere in the store"
good,"I enjoyed working at Best Buy, Had lots of friends, merchandise, memories, sales, and security...  One day they announced they were Closing MI stores."
good,"Really enjoyed working with my supervisors, peers and co-workers. Great work/life balance. Good development program. Great employee discounts and wonderful campus"
good,"Management was wonderful and concerned for employees. They took the time to teach and train new and existing employees. They never alienated any employee and promoted teamwork as well as encouraging a ""self-updating"" attitude."
good,I got out of Best Buy exactly what I wanted to. I grew as a salesperson and learned a lot. That is all it had to offer me. Management is inconsistent and far to personal. It is nice to have down-to-earth managers BUT it is not appropriate to be petty when interacting with employees. Things should be done according to policy and not according to how you feel about the employee on a certain day.
good,"Great job and great people. However,little to no opportunity for advancement. It's very competitive but that's what makes it fun. I would definitely recommend it."
good,Not a horrible place to work but don't expect to move up unless you know someone or you work yourself to death covering every single shift and work doubles ALL the time.
good,"It was a fun and structured work environment, employee's were kind and courteous as well as management. There was room for moving up in the company. I was pleased to walk into work each day."
good,"So far I have had a great experience working for Best Buy.  The store has a very strong team culture and the Management team plays a big role.  They foster communication and sponsor activities to develop associates not only for Best Buy, but for their personal lives as well."
good,"If you have the right team and systems in place, Best Buy can be an amazing place to work. I had a lot of development and amazing times working for this company. As in any sales business, there can be issues that arise, but as long as you have effective leaders who truly care about the team, it can be managed correctly. Without great leadership, the environment can quickly deteriorate."
good,"I had the pleasure to serve under two of the best managers and colleagues I have ever worked with. However, the company has no progression, the team there were brilliant but the lack of progression and false promises lead to many stressful conversations."
good,this was a great place to work if you were a student or looking for your first job. Also great if you are trying to gain some retail experience. friendly place to work
good,"Bestbuy definitely encouraged ""fun with the company."" For the most part, it worked out. In 2012 we were pushed to sell protection plans as front end cashiers. There were some alright discounts and stock options."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best Buy operates under a believe in their core values.  As a whole they really try to incorporate these values in all that they do.  They are in a continual mission to put the customer in the center of all processes.
good,"When I was on the merchandising side, the job really only consisted of replenishing empty shelves and handling incoming trucks, twice a week. Asset Protection was a little different, but not really in a good way. The job was just standing, watching cameras. Management was good overall, but when it came to security, they weren't proactive. I honestly think I would have been more effective in a roaming type role, but that's not how Best Buy runs their security team. The hardest part about the job is standing in one spot all day. No movement at all, just watch the cameras. I left because the pay wasn't enough."
good,A typical day involves helping customers find products and give them advice on their purchases. You learn a lot about technology and how to work in a team environment. The management will vary at every store. I have had stores with only a few managers that I like and I have worked at stores where I like all of the management team. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers which can happen at any job. The best part is the look on a customer face when you know you have given them everything they asked for.
good,Una empresa con muchos valores y muy bueno para tener estabilidad.
good,"Most days involved handling returns of defective products and testing them for user errors. We had clients who we would sit down with for upwards of an hour to help diagnose computer issues or set up tech support plans. Hands on repairs of computers was very common. Employees and staff were very nice and friendly. Always learning on the job about new products and new technology. The part I enjoyed most was seeing clients leave happy after helping to resolve a problem they had with their product or computer. Fixing and building computers is sometihng I've always been interested in, so a job that allows me to learn more about that as I work there is very appealing."
good,Everyday at work was very similar. We took shipments and placed them at their appropriate places. We then would take the goods and package them into totes and ship them off to their designated stores.
good,"I worked in the busiest Best Buy in San Antonio and it very much felt like it. Very competitive and fast paced, yet the incentives make it worth it. Amazing discounts and awesome coupons are given often."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is when an upset or angry customer leaves the store happy and smiling.Assisting customers with to ensure they get what will work for them and there family.
good,I loved the energy and pace of this job. Everyone worked towards common goals to ensure the store did its best with customer satisfaction and sales. Hardest part of the job was tolerating coworkers who did not have the same work ethic as myself.
good,"Do not get me wrong, I loved my coworkers at BestBuy and overall I would say that I learned a lot from them, as they were my first real sales job where I received an hourly wage. The downside comes when I say that management was not willing to work with my school schedule, so I could no longer work there. It seemed like tiring work a lot of time, but that is mainly due to the fact that back then I lack the patience that I have now."
good,"I greatly enjoy working at Best Buy most days. This is mostly because I have great managers and coworkers, but this will vary depending on your location. "
good,"Workplace was very calm and open. Each associate was close to one another. Certainly a great place to work. Management was open and honest about individual and store goals, and how your performance could be enhanced to benefit you and the store."
good,best buy is a decent place to work and learn costumer service. the people working there are friendly and easy to get along with. with the exception of a manager or two most managers are really friendly and easy to talk to.
good,"The work was fun and satisfying, when there was work. Amount of work would vary from next to nothing to a load that was nearly impossible to finish. My manager was very easy to work with and overtime was given as needed. Best Buy Corporate was less easy to work with and they ended up eliminating the entire department that I worked for (Project Team, Solar)."
good,"Hours could change due to mostly everyone being part time.  You would work different hours and different days depending on how they scheduled you.  They are flexible with those in school and those with second jobs."
good,Really good place to work at. A great entry level job where there's  a lot of opportunities to grow within the company. The company focuses on employee satisfaction as well as customer satisfaction.
good,"its relaxed compared to other warehouse house jobs "
good,"Great place to work as a line-level associate, job demands are strenuous once in leadership.  Direction of the company seems to be on the right path going forward"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,It's really fun place to work for. Actually I really like it. Wish the pay is a little better and the hours are more consistent.  Another thing is the advancing situation is a bit frustrating. I noticed they promote people outside departments that are under qualified then someone that has experience.
good,working for this company was a lot of work and very stressful and not a lot of pay to do it. I loved my sales team the management they were great. I would tell anyone to work for them just need a new pay structure.
good,i learned alot working for bestbuy ....i was one the top sellers in the district...family enviroment ...great discounts ..love helping people face to face
good,"The job was very enjoyable. Very fast paced environment, warehouse workers tend to be held to a higher expectation level. There just weren't very many advancement opportunities unfortunately."
good,Good company to work for. The people are great and the environment is comfortable. I am very happy with this organization. There is room for upward mobility and help always available.
good,"It was a great place to learn for beginners that want to be in the IT Field, A great place to learn about communication between the client and you. I do wish though they emphasize on bettering their turn time and also offer the ability to learn different skills for the advancement in skills that would be needed for the future."
good,"Tienda departamental donde se disfruta mas apoyando a los clientes, las ventas no son por comisión pero aun a si la paga cuando se trabaja de tiempo completo es buena, la actitud de trabajo da a un gran desempeño en las ventas, la administración es un poco rotativa pues siempre están ascendiendo a los lideres hay mucha oportunidad de crecer si te ven con buena actitud y mucho entusiasmo"
good,"loved working for them they worked with my school schedule, for 3 yrs. in 3 different locations they promote and move around. room for growth and self development."
good,The job itself wasn't anything special; just something for a college student to do while they go to school. The higher-ups are more focused on associates knowing how to sell things rather than what they're selling. The fact that there is no commission is also fairly unattractive for those that know anything about electronics.
good,Best Buy is consistently buzzing with energy on their corporate campus. The campus itself has a variety of amenities and services that are a great benefit to employees. The company itself has a resiliency and energy that are distinct.
good,"you learn allot working at best buy, like how certain customer reacts to individual products, new technologies and how they play a part in the growing technologically advanced world we live in"
good,A typical day at work includes selling the best products on the market and/or helping others by giving them the knowledge you know about the products or services. Ive learned customer service skills as well as plenty of selling and product knowledge. Management depends on which store you go to and for the most part are easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is hitting all of your numbers constantly while still remembering that you do not make commission and you are there only to make it a great customer experience. I do love the work environment and most of the people i work with. The company has great perks and is very enjoyable if you love what you are doing.
good,Both stores I worked at tried to make working there as fun as possible and had activities that brought all the employees together. I have met a lot of great people through Best Buy and made some close friends.
good,"There is a lot of products knowledge and interactions with people. Each single client is unique and is coming to see us with specific needs and requirements. Our job is to find out what those"
good,I would go in and start on tracking reports. This would take a max amount of 10 minutes. After this I would help with invoices and whatever else people needed help with. The teams I worked with were great and the people are amazing as well. The workplace is great but the hardest part about the job is staring at numbers for 8 hours a day.
good,Bestbuy has an amazing work enviroment and very good training for new employees. The work culture is very fun and supports individual growing. Management is nice and caring for every employee and address issues seriously. The hardest part of the job was during peak hours when the pressure really does increase many times over.
good,I started my first job ever at Best Buy and met a lot of my close friends there.  I also gained a lot of experience on how to provide excellent customer service.
good,Great company. They care about the employees. Just leave your business outside of work and only concentrate on work. They welcome everyone with open arms
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Worked unlocking merchandise, tv and kitchen appliance. Shipping and receiving periodically, learning how to use heavy  equipment, electric pallet jack. Can be busy during holiday but is to be expected."
good,"Good balance for a typical college student, management is fair and they allow you to balance personal with work.  The hardest part of asset management roles are that they tend to be boring.  The culture is open to letting you be yourself and enjoy your coworkers"
good,You definitely need to be adaptive to work here. Needs of the business and the customer change VERY quickly so keeping up is imperative. The amount of full time availability is limited but overall not a bad place to work
good,Hours are flexible. Pay is good but you work harder than what you are paid. There's room for advancement in the company often. Management can be a bit unprofessional and immature but they are here for you. Great company
good,Most sales people are pushy and kind of rude to bully you around to make a sale. This holds true at Best Buy where only the most un-caring and egotistical people succeed.
good,"Selling TV's to customers all day, everyday. I learned a lot about technology, and how advance its becoming. Management was okay until they made changes again. Culture environment was great, always having a good time and laughing. The hardest part was black Friday week as far as preparing goes. The most enjoyable was working with customers and meeting new people."
good,I worked in the geek squad for about 6 months. It was actually an awesome job. Especially given that the job is based upon technical knowledge. The only problems that arise when working at bestbuy is the lackluster management. Some managers proved to be profoundly incompetent in areas of customer service and employee management. Managers would frequently try and pull employees from our busy department to run registers and such. Be aware of this when applying. All else with the job was excellent.
good,Hours can be bad and the people can be worst but the rewards for sticking around are great. Get employee discounts and ok pay. Management want you to succeed
good,Working at best buy taught me many skills that I have mastered today. I learn how to sell and interact with customers to close sales. Working at best buy is a great learning experience.
good,"Best Buy was a fun place to work.I was in my comfort zone so it all came easy.I enjoyed pleasing my customers ,and if they  came in our store unhappy I make sure they walk away happy."
good,"While the job security was not great for a temp or contracted worker, there was always something to do, plenty to learn, and enough to keep you busy. Pay was good as well."
good,"I had a truly amazing store manager, however I felt that the training provided by my direct manager was lacking. I leaned a lot from my team and value the experiences that I had with this company. the corporate leadership however was terrible."
good,best buy is all about enjoying work and taking care of our customers. management can be alot better when it comes to being openminded and helpful on the sales foor . overall a really good job
good,"Departments all worked together very well, customers for the most part were easy to please. Management at most times were very supportive, and easy to communicate with."
good,There's a lot of teamwork involved each day we work as a team to give customers the best customer service that any company can offer in order to grow the buisness.
good,"Le département geeksquad etait très bien. On s'occupait de nos clients, résoudre les problèmes informatiques."
good,"Being a female who sold tvs I got alot of sexism. And the Tinley Park area is very racist. But the work place is wonderful, and the people are very kind. So you don't have to worry too much."
good,"Decent starting job that has a lot to learn from. Everyday is a challenge, and there is always something to learn, including how to use new technology and interact with clients."
good,"Worked there over 4 years until the store closed down."
good,Best Buy is a great environment for a part time position to work with during school. Depending on management can be very flexible which is the best part about them.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Company culture is geared toward ""having fun while being the best""."
good,"Typical sales job with typical customers, typical co-workers, typical bosses, typical sales quotas."
good,You get decent amount of hours. There are a lot of different areas of the company to work in. The manager or some of the managers do a good job at making sure you have what you need or help you learn the job. when it got busy a lot of time you were left to hang if the right managers were not working at the time.
good,Part time position so no benefits options. Culture was good as was always pretty light and fun. Good people in management. Always took time to take care of concerns and even teach management skills.
good,I was sale lead and supervisor at two location. I enjoy the roll; the environment was fun and exciting to work for. The management staff was great i learned a lot better how to lead a team the right way.
good,"Management in my location wasn't so great, the team was great though. Hardest part of the job was obviously dealing with difficult customers. Overall, the discount was great!"
good,"Enjoyed my job for the most part. Management was too lenient on some of the employees but otherwise, it was a nice place to work. Would recommend as a place of employment."
good,I was hired seasonal but had great time working there. Management is very friendly and the environment is fun to work in. If I were to reapply I would do it but currently I'm looking for a career job in my field.
good,"Best Buy is a cool company to work for. Training in your area of focus, lots of opportunities in play with the latest and greatest tech. Management differs from team to team and store to store. The leaders I've had in the last two years have differently greatly but have been instrumental in my development."
good,"Good company, Pretty good pay, fun place to work its a good starter job or job for in college but also a good job to support yourself if you can move up."
good,I loved the people I worked with but they didn't have enough people on shifts during busy times. Could be overwhelming and near the end they didn't offer enough hours
good,"I never had much of an issue with Best Buy except for the ""retail hours."" Other than that, it is an excellent job. I love coaching and training employees on a daily basis, and have learned excellent management skills from my upper management team."
good,"Mostly a good experience.  Managers have a lot of autonomy, so it's your luck of the draw whether you get a good manager, or a bad one.  Good ones will invest in getting you up to speed, others might let you sink or swim on your own, or pick favorites etc."
good,"Good place to learn your basics, if you have a good teacher. Middle management can be good or bad depending on who is in charge. Lots of departments to change around in for the Geek Squad."
good,everyone at this job is competitive but they have fun while being competitive so there is never any issues between people
good,Good place to work but a lot of pressure and Best Buy tends to do a store repositioning but every two years where you have to reapply for your position.
good,Daily work environment consists of helping people find technology that suits their needs and tastes. Interacting with customers to find products to make their devices work as efficiently as possible while being charismatic and providing excellent customer service.
good,I loved working here management was very professional and very helpful staff. Had great benefits and good wages with easy work load.
good,Teaches good customer service skills. good starting job. This place can teach you a lot and give you a good foundation. However here it is wh you know and not what you know.
good,"Position is very repetitive, daily responsibilities do not change unless passed on from team lead. Great benefits for working there"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"For a seasonal job, it sufficed in hours and workload but due to geographical location, I repeatedly found myself encountering language barriers with patrons. Besides the unfortunate obstacle on my behalf and lack of understanding, I thoroughly enjoyed assisting customers and providing motivated and outstanding customer service whenever I had an opportunity to do so. The atmosphere was pleasant, management was understanding and utilized communication and the job was enjoyable."
good,"working for best buy can be fun. the pay is decent, discounts are great. it is very much you have to work your life around work no budge. advancement can be rough and not allot open to move into."
good,"I would have loved to stay.. "
good,The pay is excellent for the level of work you do. My store has an excellent store culture and all the associates get along fairly well. Moving up into management can be difficult and often times politics get a little too involved with the process.
good,"Working for BestBuy was a delight, in a single day associates would assist anywhere from 30-50 customers a day with their specific needs. Management had a good grip on how to effectively run the store without wasting too much time. The workplace culture allowed associates to cross train in departments they are not familiar with so that they could later support the department if it needed help. The most enjoyable part working at BestBuy would have been the satisfaction of customers that you've helped with their problems, to me, that is what gives me pride in my place of work."
good,"Great team to work with and be around, mostly positive with not a lot of problems, but of course there are always pros and cons of every place you work at"
good,"Seasonal job which lasted through Halloween to Christmas, which gave me a lot of experience as to how the public work on these crazy holidays. Learned how to use more heavy equipment."
good,"great over all the people there are great and very easy to work with, no drama what so ever. "
good,Great place to work if you are in high school/ college.  Many areas to learn and thrive in when it comes to sales and learning different technologies.
good,It is a good place to work. You can have a balance between work and quality of life. You have the chance to travel and know different people with different perspectives.
good,"Best Buy was my first job -- and I spent about 10 years with the company.  Most of my experience was spent as a member of Project Team, setting planograms and merchandising the stores in a given district.  The key to enjoying your time with this company is developing a great relationship with your upper management and knowing when to call HR."
good,It's a good place to work at wanted to be there longer but it was just temporary position learned a lot about TV and how to work on them.
good,"The typical day in the life of and advanced repair agent was repairing and service, client units that were brought in for repair.  I learned various techniques on virus removal, I learned about the Windows 7, 8.1 and Windows 10 Operating Systems.  I learned how to interact with clients in person.  I learned how to trouble shoot and solve computer problems."
good,"I loved working at Best Buy and was heartbroken when they closed our location down. To me, there was nothing hard about working there-some days were a little more challenging with the customers in the service or returns area. The most enjoyable part of the job was the compensation and the discounts we received. It was like their overall way of thanking the employees for all their hard work."
good,Best Buy was a fun and energetic place to work. Surrounded by ever changing technology. The full time benefits are good.
good,Great place to work retail.  Great environment and the management was fair and honest.  Enjoyed going to work each day as it was always a pleasant shift.
good,"I loved working at Best Buy because of all the new technology, many new faces you get to meet everyday and getting the hottest deals on technolofy devices!"
good,"As long as you do your job everything goes well. Pay is good, and management takes care of their employees as long as they are productive. Co-workers are fun people make your hours go by. The hardest part is not doing your job and getting behind. It can be overwhelming with customers."
good,"fun job, great for high school jobs or part time would love to be a manager there, people were friendly. i sold cameras and i ended up sing the discount to get myself a nice one"
good,"Best Buy provides a fast paced, open floor, non-commission sales experience. There are individual sales goals to be obtains by every employee in every department. Your job title will determine your sales goal. Overall, its a very team based work environment."
good,"Best Buy is a place where many different skill sets are brought together to accomplish one goal, customer service. I learned the art of dealing with a variety of personality types, both coworkers and customers, in a respectful and joyful manner."
good,"I really enjoyed it here. I learned so much more about technology that I ever thought I would get to. Buckle up for the eLearn days. They are long, but worth it in the end."
good,"I really enjoyed working at the Best Buy Warehouse for the most part. Good pay, good insurance, and chance for additional hours. Direct management was great ."
good,"Co-workers are fun and knowledgeable, management is always looking out for your best interests, but pressure is high on meeting sales goals. Overall a pretty solid learning experience, and rather enjoyable."
good,"Flexible schedule for college students, however hours are inconsistent if you have many bills to pay.  Days you need off will probably will be granted, but no vacation time unless you're full-time."
good,"I have learned a lot while working for Best Buy, some of the stuff learned is how to use a pallet jack, electric pallet jack, trash compactor, and a platform lift. My co-workers are fun to work with and also hard working. The managers are strict but fair, as long as you do your job they will take care of you."
good,"Good starter place to learn about warehouse work. Some opportunities to move up but is very competitive. With some stores closing down in recent years, a lot of layoffs have happened in the DC and the general morale has gone down because of this job insecurity."
good,Work days consist of helping customers find complete solutions for their technological needs. Store Management is engaged and works closely with their teams. The most enjoyable aspect is being able to put a smile on a customers face when you solve an issue or get them set up with a new piece of tech.
good,"After an awesome cup of coffee on my way to work, I was happy to join my co-workers for a fun productive day. We would grab our walkies to keep in touch with each other during our shift so we could be of help to each other. The day would begin after the manager would open the front doors. Helping our customers to build a complete solution by getting to know them by asking them questions and listening to their answers for a satisfied sale that would also keep them from returning what they bought and a return customer."
good,Great place to work if your into cutting edge technology. Great staff and great teams to work with. The Learning center will keep you sharp when it comes to learning about all of the new things coming out.
good,"Going into work each day were actually exciting to get into. With such a large store with various products to sell, there's usually no shortage of things to do or projects to work on. Not to mention the addition to dealing with customers. If you dread working with people you really strive in this area. As for working with the staff, for the most part, functioned like a well-oiled machine. Many were friendly and fun to be around.They have a wide variety of training modules of the products they sell and are here to help educate you to carry over that knowledge to give your customers further insight. I actually liked this a lot and you'd be surprised how this isn't really such a tedious endeavor. If you are a people's person or task oriented you may find yourself never bored for too long. "
good,Learned a lot about customer service and return policies as well as recycling information. I have discovered quite a bit about electronics as well as cameras and computers.
good,Great place to work. Love the environment and always had something to do. Not much bad to say about this place. I don't like the fact you have to sell magazines while checking customers out.
good,Rate Best buy 4 out of 5 stars. Spent a year and a half there. Hoped to longer but life spins sometimes in a direction unfavorable. Good place to work.
good,"Great culture, people and good managers. Benefits are also one of the best if not the best cause of discounts. good envirement and a easy place too work"
good,"Good job overall, but they really don't respect your schedule. The team is SPECTACULAR. There's also plenty of opportunity to move up in the company"
good,fun to work but pay is very minimun for the jobs performed to many resonsabilities for the pay managment is good but cold be better and bonuses are very rare and worthless
good,"This is a job, not a career.  Best buy leadership greatly interferes with the mission of Geeksquad preventing it from being a truly great service environment."
good,"The company was very driven by performance metrics, your job was dependent on it.  This caused many people to ""win"" at all costs, compromising their integrity."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Best Buy. My managers and coworkers worked very well together. It was almost like a family. I was in school at the time, and they worked around my schedule."
good,What do you expect? Working in retail is always a great idea for those looking to make some extra money or as a temp job between life events. I would most likely be willing to work here again.
good,I have been working at Best Buy for a little over a year at time of writing. If you enjoy learning new technology and talking to people you. My personal store has upper management problems but its chill overall
good,"Of all the retail places I have worked at, Best Buy is the store I have enjoyed working for the most. My position is a very busy one, but it is not a difficult job. As far as management goes, they have always been pretty good to me; whether it is working around my school schedule or helping me with childcare issues, they are normally very understanding and helpful."
good,"I was happy with my time at Best Buy. Our workdays as managers usually consisted of answering emails, making sure the computers and systems to sell phones were up and running, helping customers find their perfect mobile solution, and making sure the staff is performing their job duties in addition to coaching them to ensure they're constantly improving. I would say the hardest and most fulfilling part of the job, at my location at least, was dealing with the clientele. It was a great feeling once someone was able to get a phone, but getting them approved was a challenge."
good,"great benefits, not the best management, worked there for almost 6 years and enjoyed most of it, eventually got tired of working in retail though, good company though"
good,Good company.  The industry changes quickly and repeatedly so you have to stay up to date with technology.  Management has changed drastically over the last 2 months and the place is chaotic getting ready for the holidays.
good,Good place to work getting starting in computer repair. Steady employment with good exposure to current consumer technology. Full time positions have full benefits. Overall fun place to work.
good,"I worked as a business-to business Inside Sales person.  It was a newly formed department at the time.  80% cold calling in an assigned territory.  Best Buy offered great training on the products which occurred at least 1-3 times a week."
good,"Best Buy, is on the leading edge of providing the a great customer experience.  They highlight the latest and greatest home electronics.  Best Buy offers fast advancement to successful and dedicated employees."
good,I have enjoyed working at Best Buy. It is a place where you can enjoy mapping your own career so long as you have someone advocating for you. Best Buy is a great company.
good,"I learned everything about the products that I was running transactions for. I learned, from no experience, what a busy multi-tasked workplace was, and how to handle time-management, including keeping a straight head in a busy workplace."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Best Buy. I worked as a sales associate in the mobile department. It was difficult learning about phone plans at first but got used to it with time.
good,Best Buy is a good company to work for. The company's culture was amazing and a fun place to work. They encourage you to have a best friend at work. I would recommend Best Buy
good,Each day was something new. Every customer that walked through the door was a different experience. The constant changing technology made it fun to learn the new products.
good,"BestBuy gives employees a vast amount of opportunities to understand the linguistics and skills needed in order to be a successful salesman, while at the same time promoting quality service to consumers. Managing staff are often competent and helpful with sales and product knowledge and can offer some great advice to improve productivity. The cultural atmosphere is welcoming but can seem challenging at first due to a results oriented nature of the departments, but once a employee gets used to the products and process, sales becomes less challenging."
good,"If you're looking for a decent part time job with higher than minimum wage it's a good job. Management at the store i work at isn't bad,manager are generally pretty laid back."
good,Fast paced customer and technology oriented job that focuses on services and end to end solutions for clientele.  Always evolving and changing to stay on top of new specialty electronics.
good,"If you live relatively close to a Best Buy, and they happen to be hiring, go for it. Best Buy offers incredible opportunities, unfortunately for me, I lived a good 4 miles from this job, which made the commute a bit of a hassle."
good,I was a project team specialist company offered really good work life balance great benefits people were really friendly management were good people.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The company has great values and works to create a great work culture. You form great relationships with co-workers while learning about all the newest tech."
good,"My day starts off and ends with talking to client about their computer problems. I access the situation and make the best recommendation for the client if we are unable to fix the computer. I've learned sales skills and how to be very personable. Management for the most part is easy going, if you end up messing up they give good advice and constructive criticism. My co-workers are fun and easy going as well. They know how to stay on task while having fun. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the technology and all the new fixes for broken computers. What I enjoy the most about the job is the competitiveness of the employees. At geek squad we hold competitions to see who is the best and win prizes."
good,Really enjoyable environment getting to walk through the store and help customer find their needs. Also floating to different departments and getting to specialize in other products made it easier to get promotions.
good,"I've enjoyed my experience here at Best Buy. As with any job, there will be complications and issues. Overall, my experience has taught me a lot! Definitely will get you prepared for your career."
good,I loved that employee discount never had anything come anywhere near as close. Didn't get much hours but I was just a kid in school so I never complained.
good,"On a regular day of work , I would just go in and  check in with the manager and get positive and negative feed back for my sales for the month and where I am on the sales cart. I would also track my goal for the day and proceed to work."
good,great company to work for lots of opportunities.  Lots of work and workload is too heavy for amount of leadership.  pay for employees is low and not engaging to acquire best staff.
good,"I loved working here. Some of the best people I've ever worked with, I met here. It was a fun, enjoyable environment with a great staff. I worked in the warehouse, so I didn't really do sales, so i had, what I felt was, a very stress-free environment."
good,"the company as whole was great, the managment for my location could have been better. .thought i was getting into a company with room to grow but they ended up downsizing ."
good,"Great environment to work in with amazing people to match.  A typical day is like any in retail where you are helping customers while giving a great experience.  My day usually consists of building schedules, monitoring labour, ordering supplies for the store.  We also are very invested in the growth of our staff.  Leaders are constantly training and teaching out on the floor.  "
good,My typical day was just doing whatever was asked of me and doing it as quickly and efficiently as possible. I was taught any important tasks and the way of doing them that I needed to know. Everyone that I worked with had a great sense of humor and made it more fun to work there.
good,"Fun place,"
good,"My co-workers were nice, and the location of my store was perfect. Most customers were very nice and it was easy to keep them leaving happy!"
good,I sold computers and worked on cashier. Got payed for training and break room was awesome. Only bad part is we had 2 managers and one seemed more commited than the other. Sometimes they wanted me to work on other fields i didnt have experience on and rated me based on sales.
good,"typical day at work was long, but enjoyable. Learned a lot about computers and selling them. Management was great, always put his employees before himself. coworkers were hardworking and always helped each other out. The hardest part was stocking top shelves, the most enjoyable part was the average day at work"
good,"great place to work, lots of room to grow and opportunities. Great place to learn sales experience. Management is fairly decent."
good,Change is the only constant. Renew Blue helped Best Buy get through the toughest moments. Now management is looking for growth. Good people; Tough industry.
good,"Great place to work if you do not have any specific skills or degree. Offers training, opportunities to advance, and great pay! I have worked at 3 locations and have enjoyed them all. Always enjoy the people I work with."
good,BestBuy es una empresa que te enseña a como trabajar en equipo.  Es una empresa donde te ayudan a crecer pero al mismo tiempo no brinda buen ingreso económico.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Hardest part was making the time to study the tutorials online outside of work. But it definitely helped me in the warehouse in the back of the store as well as with customers.
good,"Working at Best Buy, I learned the aspects of selling merchandise and being more active in the workplace. I gained a sense of self-confidence also and was better at solving dilemmas and creating better solutions for both the consumer and myself. Every workday was about the same and you had to meet a certain goal that you yourself set and achieve. I was the youngest at the time of the employees and fitting in or gaining assistance from another was very easy. There were times where I was unable to assist a customer and also had no one to help and it was frustrating, but eventually I did receive the help I need in order to get the task done."
good,"What I do here is Sales, Handle phone calls and in store customers simultaneously, Followup on and place orders for customers. I have also learned how to use several of Best Buys programs within weeks of being there. I have learned how to handle myself in just about any situation thrown at me with a positive attitude, and I have also learned how to handle a multitude of things presented to me at any given time. The hardest part about this job is really only three people within the store really know how to run my position, and only one of us are there at any given time,so there is no ""breaks"" offered to us during the work day- only lunch breaks are offered when managers are available to relieve us of our position."
good,"What you would imagine as a retail job: frustrating customers and slightly pushy managers. All in all, the pay was good (comparatively) and everyone was friendly."
good,The working environment is great because I'm around what i love (electronics).  The pay and benefits are decent too.  Id say the worst part about working there is the management.  A couple managers are total jerks but there are some other managers who are super nice.
good,Best Buy is very dedicated to ensuring that their employees are well trained. As a GM for the company I was able to watch employees develop and advance their careers with Best Buy.
good,"Work was straight forward and routine. Coworkers were very knowledgable and friendly. Management was okay, they could work on making a better work environment and culture."
good,This is a great place to work if you are just starting out! It helps develop skills you will need to further your career in any direction you choose to pursue.
good,"It's a fun workplace, specially since I love technology. I learned how to be patient. "
good,Best buy overall was a good company to work for and everyone got along including management I just wish I had gotten more hours.
good,A typical day at work us constantly fast paced and upbeat while unloading the merchandise. Management is good but can use some improvements.
good,"An exciting, fun place to work. We have knowledgeable people which makes learning extremely fun. A typical day would consist of troubleshooting,diagnosing,repairing and contacting clients."
good,"A day at best buy is pretty simple. It is you job to help the customer find the best product that fits their needs, and assist them with any problems they are having. Management is very involved the productivity of their employees, and takes the time to help them grow and get promoted."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job at Best Buy is I get to do what I love, I work with great people who have great futures ahead of them. My position I am in is fun I'm always busy and still learning and I enjoy what I do,"
good,"A typical day at work was getting in to my department and cleaning up before the store opened.  I was the Samsung Experience Representative so my department was the Samsung shop (South Edmonton Common location).  My duties would include speaking to customers about the various products that Samsung offers, tablets, smart phones, smart T.V's etc.  I learned a lot about customer interaction and service and how to deal with multiple customer situations good and bad.  The management was good there I don't have any complaints.  The co-workers were also great I always enjoyed going in to work to be able to work in an environment with such a good energy.  The hardest part of the job would have to be waking up at 5 a.m to start work at 6 a.m on boxing day.  On a serious note there wasn't much hard about my job there I did have a bit of trouble engaging customers when I first started there but that quickly went away and soon because not just easy but enjoyable.  The most enjoyable part of the job i had was delivering excellent customer service and seeing how happy it made people that they see you go the extra mile for them to help them out."
good,"As an AP, my job consist on making sure the store has an safe secure experience for the customers. I  Helped with crowd control and maintained visual on suspicions activity. My co-workers are at the moment very helpful with their customers and the mangers compliments their peers for a good work done."
good,"It's a fast paced environment that keeps you active and challenged, to say the least. I enjoy the customer service workplace , you meet new people every day and you never know who might walk through those doors. You keep up with new and constantly changing technology that makes you an expert in your own style."
good,"I started working at Best Buy at Sixteen, I was the youngest person to work on the sales floor before starting on register. I loved learning about the different parts in a computer, i also loved explaining to customers which computer / product would benefit them the most. Hardest part about the job was the management it was very unclear what the managers were asking from the employees sometime they would ask us to help customers in different departments. Ex. Home theater but then would get agitated that we were not in our departments they were lots of managers at best buy who did not communicate with themselves. The most enjoyable part about my job was talking to customers. Not every customer was fun to talk to but often customers like to talk about whats going on in their life or the reason that they are shopping for a new laptop / tv."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"A typical day at work involves selling products to meet an hourly goal. I learned how to interact with people of all sorts and overcome objections. Management takes turns floor leading to motivate sales force and connect employees with customers. Co-workers are a very diverse segment of the job as they all come from different backgrounds and interact on the same team because nobody works for commission. The hardest part of the job is trying to overcome objections because people keep giving more and more when you come up with a solution instead of saying ""I'm not really buying a product today"". The most enjoyable part of a job is that you can interact with many people."
good,Overall great experience. Youthful teams. Great product knowledge. Training of team was so critical of the stores performance. Great Very fun place to work.
good,"Best Buy was a place I could start out with little to no knowledge and leave with more than I could have ever found online or in books. Best Buy's online training and sales induction meetings helped me to become the best sales representative I could never have achieved on my own. I was always encouraged to step outside of my comfort zone and push my skills in new ways, even though I only worked part time and went to school. Best Buy's view on sales people is much different than the average car or life insurance sales person. They believe in selling a product that will benefit the customer and finding a total solution for each individual. This really sets Best Buy apart from any other retail establishment. Best Buy expects their employees to know the ins and outs of every product their customers may come in contact with and not only selling the product, but building value in the product and finding solutions that will help support the customers needs in the future as they relate to their products."
good,All of my coworkers are great people and fun to work with.  Downside about the job is I feel like I am not getting paid enough for what I do.  If there was commission I wouldn't have such a problem.
good,"Best Buy is a great place to get proffesionally trained on all aspects of sellings skills, but for what they ask you to do, the pay is heavily lacking."
good,"Sure, the work can and WILL be stressful with quotas(especially from a sales floor perspective), but seeing all the latest and greatest can be rewarding with truly caring Management that will try to suede you to their needs. Its very difficult if your a student and Corporate jobs always make it hard to request off/work around your schedule. If you have little personal life and no other jobs or timeful hobbies, this is a great place to work, with good FULL time benefits. However, if you hve any of the mentioned time consumers, look elsewhere or be extremely over worked and stressed."
good,"it has not been long since I started working here, but I have been liking it so far. Co-workers have been nice and store management has been helpful."
good,The people I worked with were wonderful and it made it enjoyable to go to work. The hardest part of the job was knowing what I was supposed to do on a daily basis as the training was not very good. I enjoyed my position there and the physical aspects that came with the duties that I had.
good,"I loved my time at Best Buy, absolutely loved it. I was hired on as occasional/seasonal to ""see how I did through the holiday's."" I was told when I was hired that they would let me know if they were going to keep me or not. I tried speaking to my direct supervisor about it several times, but he would only tell me that someone would come talk to me about it soon. I was informed on January 26th that my last day was going to be the following Saturday. No one informed me ahead of time that I needed to be looking for another job or anything. The only reason I even found out was because I noticed my name wasn't on the next weeks schedule. I took it to the GM and he told me that I was ""lost in the mix"" because they were doing lead changes. Now, I understand that I was only occasional/seasonal, but that's no way to treat any employee."
good,jetait tres motivé a travailler pour cette entreprise l'équipe etait incroyable (les gerants comme les employé) le travail ce faisait bien on travaillais en equipe et tout etait ordonné
good,"My overall experience at best buy was an enjoyable one. The only really bad thing I will say is that once seasonal was up, I was simply told thank you at the end of my shift for helping and was given no notice. Also, I was the only one who received that treatment."
good,Large commitment to helping customers with their technology needs. Lots of training provided. Hardest part is dealing with irate customers that forget that employees are people too. The best part is the teamwork.
good,"If you're still in school, looking for a part time job, Best Buy is a great place to start.  You'll learn a lot about basic customer service and following rules that are passed down from management."
good,Will always have fun at work. Will always be on top of the new technology. Will be informed by vendors. At times you will work crazy hours during phone launches and black Friday. Great leaders that care about their employees.
good,"This is a fair company to work with, but there are too many managers and they all have different requirements which makes the job much harder."
good,"Good place to work."
good,"If you want a good starting job Best Buy is a great place to work, it's tough to move up in the company unless you know people.  I recommend it for a starting college student, but any farther then that I wouldn't recommend it."
good,"Good pay especially when your in college, good employment discounts. Just wish the management was a little better. I had a hard time trying to stay as an part-time employee but they wanted someone there full-time to take care other irresponsible employees jobs."
good,"A typical day would be helping customers understand their product they purchased, as well as fitting the needs of the customer with the right product."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,A typical workday includes talking to customers about the latest and greatest products of technology that may have peaked their interest. Working at Best Buy I have learned how to craft the perfect solution for customers and make sure that they receive exactly what they needed and then some. My management staff is great and always eager to help or teach. My co-workers for the most part are excellent and add into the culture of Best Buy perfectly. The hardest part of the job is not closing a sale or giving a customer their perfect solution. The most enjoyable part is having a customer return after I assisted them and reaffirming how much they love their products and service provided.
good,I have learn so much about the customer experience use personal and no personal devices. Everyone Is always willing to help you with anything you need to help the customer. One of the hardest parts though is technology is always changing sometimes its hard to know every single device. Most days I start my day greeting my co-worker than check our daily goals. Then I start by moving on to floor help and meet customers needs to ensure they get the information they need to get the right product and services. This could include just smiling and saying hi making sure they know I am here even if they don't need help at this point in time.
good,"great company to work for, with cutting edge technology and a fast paced retail environment.  Not much work/life balance once you hit the management side of the business."
good,"Best thing is the pricing for accessories. Main items are not on employee discount, unless they are an accommodation from the manufacturer itself..."
good,Fun place to work because of all the gadgets and gizmos. Customers can be rude but if you have a thick skin its not too bad. Beginning pay is low but if you advance then the money gets really good. The job security is rough as they do go through company restructures every few years. Over all a good place to work if you have the right management team.
good,"It is never a boring day at Best Buy, what with a variety of customers coming in. Everyone has different needs, with a different sense of humor, whether it be a customer or a coworker. I feel as though I make a new friend everyday and that, to me, is the most enjoyable part if the job."
good,"The perks are definitely what keep you here. They offer a tremendous employee discount, and a discounted phone line with a carrier. However, come the holidays especially, the work/life balance pretty much goes out the window. Working every weekend year round gets frustrating."
good,"It was nothing bad, best buy does not pay on commission, if you have a lot of sales experience with commission i would not recommend this job. Great for starting out/in college job. If you are willing to work then you will move up."
good,"I've been here for 9 years, great place to grow and learn retail. Go above and beyond and you will get a lot from the company."
good,"The guys and girls I work with are awesome, the work is not hard, if you know what you are doing.  It can be stressful at time, but most of the time its a nice relaxed place to work, as long as you do your job."
good,Good culture to work for . Employees pay ranges from 8.75-11.50 and people in the store seem to be generally happy with this pay scale. It is severely underpaid for the mobile department seeing how a lot of jobs in that industry average around $30 a hour when you include commissions.
good,"Great work environment, flexible hours, good team that was friendly and enjoyed teaching the different tricks of the trade to get the task accomplished"
good,"Very easy to get along with everyone who works there."
good,"Its really fun working here, sometimes it feels like challenging but I really like the way everything is so organized here, even your management is so friendly that you can talk with them like they are your friends"
good,Best Buy by far was my favourite company by far.  It is a professional and dynamic workplace for learning accounting.  My only regret that it was a contract job.
good,this is a great place to learn and grow as a employee i learned a lot from technology and bussiness in equal parts worked with new technology and had a great time doing it the pay and hours were rough though
good,Best Buy provided an enjoyable work environment.  The financial compensation as an associate is not enough to provide an incentive to stay given a better opportunity however the co-workers are great.
good,Could be very demanding at times depending where we stood on the National Score Card. Learn about a lot of new tech coming to stores and also how to deal with customer issues and making sure they are taken care of. Management was fair and expected you to come to them with any concerns or ideas of improvement yo felt was needed. Co-workers were all easy going and fun to work with and made the job the most enjoyable. Hardest part of the job was trying to tackle a customer issue that wasn't going in the path you intended and when that happens I would team up with management to get a resolve.
good,"Taught me lessons in merchandising, inventory management and also customer service. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and managers and working towards the satisfaction of customers."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Overall the people there are amazing my problem came wit how the company set people up for failure at all times. Typical day at work involved getting yelled and thanked by customers.
good,Best Buy is a great place to work where you can enjoy what you do and be around all the new electronics. It does get time consuming during the holidays.
good,Not a bad part time job.  Hours are ok and its indoors.  Plus you get to see and gain knowledge about a wide rage of products.  Would recommend as a part time job.
good,"Typical day includes helping customers, straightening products and learning about the products. Management is ok, just gotta get through the day. Hardest part of the job is meeting the budget and sales goals."
good,For starting out in college but also ascertaining actual office environment skills the job is great. room for advancement is very little if at all
good,It is a very fun loving place. It is like you are apart of a family. the managers are cool and easy to talk to. But the pay is very low and most times you are not paid what you are worth.
good,"I was there during a time where a lot of technology was on the cusp of becoming what it is today. It was my pleasure to be able to advice customers on the ""complete solution"" during that time."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work, especially if you are young and/or single. The management is great, and there is definitely a team mindset about the place. Their sales goals are realistic, yet can be very challenging as well."
good,I've been with Best Buy for going on 10 years.  I love this company and wish that working remotely wouldn't dictate the ability to advance.  I love the people I work with and love what I do.
good,I loved working here because of the amount of training and knowledge I received.  I wasn't super techy but still ended up being one of the top sales professionals within the department!
good,The best thing about Best Buy is their culture.  The 4 company values are directly reflected in their people.  The positive atmosphere and the desire to always improve is why the company has thrived.  The original founder/CEO did amazing things in the retail world and it started with his principles and core values.
good,"typical day at work, starts with me doing paper work, organizing the warehouse, work on assignments and plan for the next day each day is different, and I deal with costumer problems or questions sins I have great customer service skills and I'm able to come up with solutions and answers fast. I'm a fast learner I help and resolve as many problems true out the day."
good,"Being one of the leading electronics retailer, Best Buy Canada updates its product range from time to time keeping a good relationship with a variety of customers. "
good,Their motto is to have fun while being the best. Great work atmosphere and amazing leadership. Wonderful way to advance in one's own field of expertise on current electronics.
good,"•	Prevention of shrink/theft and to ensure a safe environment"
good,Great place to grow and learn. Working here was always a fun experience and everyday was something new to learn. I took a lot from working at best buy.
good,"This company has taught me many things when it comes to dealing with customers and interacting with others. The Lessons I learned about leadership, teamwork and communicating with others cannot be measured."
good,"Una empresa familiar donde se han hecho muchos cambios y mejoras donde  varios departamnetos  se necesita tener un mejor control y agilidad en sus  procedimientos, y trabajamos de la mano siempre en servicio al cliente."
good,Had a great team while working at Bestbuy. Had one of the best supervisors at this location. Left only because of personal reasons.
good,"It can be fun and the company is always trying to improve and stay ahead of the game, which makes working there a stable job for anyone looking for a career."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Helping new costumers and helping them to get there needs in a faster pace."
good,Great work experience with great discounts and very awesome training programs. Best buy once sent me on a business training trip paid for hotel/food/transportation
good,"A typical day at work for me would consist of opening or closing the store and making sure my team knew what was expected of them that day. This job taught me how to motivate others similar in age and has taught me how to be super patient with unhappy people walking in and out of the store. "
good,"great job for the young, fun, energetic,stay in one department, discounts are super! People are great to work with, management is cheap on employee gatherings though, could do a lot more for employee appreciation. they are caring about the employees as much as the numbers though."
good,"work with fun and great opportunity to develop relationship with customers. Good incentives and motivation."
good,I grew a great deal as an employee and Agent with Geek Squad. There is a tremendous sense of camaraderie that the culture has created. Unfortunately career advancement can often be difficult and nonlinear.
good,Geek Squad had allot of older people trying to hold on to jobs so it was a big age gap. you had a few young people but mostly people in their 60's
good,Working at Best Buy provided me with experience that was necessary when it came to advancement. The pay wasnt bad and the benefits are okay if you are a full time employee. They do help pay for college.
good,"Good employee price perks. Good management for the most part. Had a lot of fun with coworkers.  More hours would've been better, hard to get full time work."
good,Fellow employees are amazing. Really focused on meeting Revenue Per Hour goals. Break room is simple. 30 minute lunches. Miscommunication with management occurs sometimes but nothing horrible.
good,"I have been working for Best Buy Mobile for 4 years.  My only complaint is that advancement is hard to come by.  Our store is pretty organized and we have the best customers!  There are hard days, especially when we aren't fully staffed.  Best Buy takes care of their employees, I just hate that I have to move out of my city for advancement."
good,"Working at best buy as a part time associate has been a pleasant experience because of its flexibility and decent hourly pay. It is good for people who could only work part time, but want to make a good pay. There are also chances to move up to full time positions or other departments."
good,"•	Handling online and over the phone orders"
good,answered inbound calls while wo rking at home and handled geek squad billing questions hardest part of job was getting in conatct with technical support when the internal system would blank off while you have a live customer on the phone who is waiting fornyour assistance.
good,Everyday is a learning course being that there are always new products coming out. Also every customer has a different situation thus balancing and improving customer service skills. Fast paced enjoyable environment. Great employees and team building.
good,This was a great experience for those that want a job in college that will work with your schedule. The best part of the job would be the people and the atmosphere.
good,"Fast-pace, but fun environment, good learning experience that helps build interpersonal skills and problem solving. Management is very understanding and supportive.  The hardest part of the job is staying calm in stressful situations.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and having fun while being the best."
good,Culture of Best Buy is different store to store. Each store is responsible for its own events and raising their own money for such events rather then having a budget for employee events. Having worked through great and terrible management it could make or break your experience. Overall I could be a great place to work as long as management cares for its employees as Best Buy as a whole does care for its employees as their are quite a lot of benefits.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,typical day at work hard to get managers to registers to help out with a situation. everyone were way to friendly which is ok until you have customers complaining about the help they did not get. so i had to be the person to make sure when i checked out that customer they at least leave happy with the customer service i gave to them. the hardest part of the job is not being able to talk to a manager about a problem without them ignoring the situation the nice part about the job is the customers.
good,"maintain a clean and neat register"
good,"It was a decent job. I worked with several different people and realized that you can always learn new things. The culture was different yet similar in the two locations I worked in and I enjoyed woking with my coworkers, who for the most part, were excellent people."
good,If youre going to work retail Best Buy seems to be the place.  Management seems to be a little shaky on the corporate level but I think that's just a retail thing.
good,"Working at Best Buy is pretty alright. Back two to three years ago I would have said this is a great place to work at, but times have changed. The newest CEO rid of many management jobs which caused managers/supervisors to be stretched far too thin. That accompanied by the reduction of other employees per position made life at work harder for every employee."
good,A typical day would include talking with customers about computing products in order to make a proper sale. Coworkers were all fun and had similar attitudes. Management were all nice and helpful. I enjoyed the feeling of making a customer satisfied with a purchase and getting good feedback from coworkers or supervisors. The hardest part would have been trying to make a sale on products in different departments I wasn't too familiar with.
good,"Great Place to work"
good,Everyday at work was like a party with your friends. We were at the top of our game and that winning attitude is contagious!
good,"My typical day at work would be productive by tending to the customers needs and selling services to go along with the items they bought. I learned a couple tricks about selling. The management team were great people, always enthusiastic and full of life. I would say the same about my co-workers as well. the most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of making the customers leave happier than when they came in. the hardest part of the job was to keep up with the cleaning since it is a busy environment."
good,"Great management and good workplace morale. The only downside is the corporate culture sometimes feels patronizing, however if you are willing to 'drink the kool-aid' so to speak, you will do very well and go far. Fair enough opportunities for advancement if you show initiative and engagement. Benefits offered at a full-time level, however pay is not super-competitive. Lot's of pressure on selling the service and geek-squad which can sometimes makes you feel like you are putting too much pressure on the customer, but if you follow the sales guidelines and know your product knowledge you will be  very successful. If you do well with sales, and make the company money, they will do what they can to keep you on ."
good,"great work environment, you need to be able to troubleshoot issues over the counter and offer solutions and services that are beneficial for the company. you'll need selling skills to offer those services and you'll need to be tech savy."
good,A typical day is expected to be busy. There is alway something that can be done to help the company gain revenue. I have learned during my time with Best Buy the importance of being part of a team. My co-workers and the management team look to me to be a great team player and always give 110%. The hardest part of my job comes when I know something that my team does not. It is up to me to make sure that everyone gets the same message before any financial harm is done. Finding everyone in time to deliver the message without getting behind in my work can be hard at times because not everyone can access their email. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to work with people I have grown to know as my family away from home.
good,Best Buy is a great to place to work at.  You get to be one of the first ones to get your hands on the latest technology out there.
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced, but overall positive and comfortable.  There are sales quotas, financing quotas, accessory basket mix quotas and many more. A little overwhelming for the beginner, but easy to master. Management at my location was fantastic. Genuinely care about their employees lives. Co-workers are just as friendly, and I have generated real lasting friendships with many of them. The revenue per hour goals tend to be a little high when compared to other places. Can be difficult on slow days for most employees to meet, and you end up fighting over customers in extreme situations. The most enjoyable part is knowing that I genuinely take care of my customers and don't force them to get anything they don't need."
good,"typical work day is slow, but picks up at night after 5, coworkers are easy to get along with. the managers are nice enough"
good,The company values and work life balance is very good at Best Buy and the CEO has done some very nice things to help turn the company around.  The one downside is the constant change the organization goes through.  You always feel like there is a potential to loose your job due to restructuring.
good,Best Buy was a journey about the customers needs. It was enjoyable to learn about new products and seeing the latest and greatest of new merchandise.
good,"The managers was really nice and helpful, along with most of the employees. A typical day at work would be answering and transferring calls, layaways, in store pick up and online orders, returns and exchanges. The one thing I didn't like was they cut everyone's hours to hardly anything !"
good,"i like geek squad, the management and ambience is perfect."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"My time at Best Buy has given me many skills that I am able to take with me to any business. I have learned many business metrics to follow, sales strategies, marketing, customer interaction skills, and management tactics and techniques. I have enjoyed my time at Best Buy thoroughly."
good,"While the management and overall work culture is great, the compensation is sub-par with minimal room for advancement. The hardest part of the job is motivating the sales floor to keep them on task and store shrink at a minimum. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers and working with awesome co-workers."
good,Friendly work environment. Team spirit required to get the job done. Everyone on the team helps one another. Excellent customer service skills required.
good,"Best Buy had its moments, the benefits lacked and so did management. Co-Workers were amazing, we connected in so many levels. The hardest part was trying to balance a healthy lifestyle while balancing work. The most enjoyable has been all the customers and their families."
good,I have been there for 2 years and it is a decent place to work while your in school or trying to figure out what you wanna do in life.
good,Nice work environment and profession atmosphere. The co-worker are proactive and fun to work with. Nice amenities in the corporate office.
good,Geek Squad is it's own culture. The clients needs are the first priority and providing that service in a world class manner. One of my favorite values is having fun while being the best. Teamwork is essential everyday by working together to make productivity goals.I have learned more with Geek Squad than any other company and I am grateful for that.
good,Maintain store's functionality and look and feel.  Working with a motivated crew and praise victories and coached oppurtunities is needed.
good,worked on sales floor also was dept. manager of backroom and overnight stock. unloaded trucks and did store counts on all inventory.
good,"highly trained employees giving knowledgeable input to customers to assist in finding them the perfect solution.  "
good,When I began working at Best Buy it was an exciting workplace the atmosphere and attitude of each employee was extremely vibrant. A typical day consisted of creating and extending wireless contracts. Management was very understandable as far as accommodating my school schedule. The only thing I dislike about this job is we are told to express to customers that we do not benefit commission wise. Although we are pushed to adhere to certain sales standards and urged to maintain specific sales quotas.
good,"around 25 hours per week, most of the managers are easy to get along with and it's a fun place to work with opportunity for advancement and job security. some positions are respected more than others"
good,Working here provided me the ability to face new challenges and face a variety of different customers which made working here interesting. I would say the only thing about it was the poor management. I'm not one to judge so easily I got to know my managers pretty good and the way they treated me and my fellow employees felt as if they weren't trained enough to be at their positions.
good,Fun and entertaining work environment. Lean and experience the latest and greatest in home theater equipment. Compensation is somewhat lacking.
good,"After clocking in and checking in with a manager, I would make sure my work area was clean, turn on tv's and wait for my first client. I learned that even though it is a retail store, referring to the customer as a client ensures that there will be an ongoing relationship which produces more revenue for the company. I had the greatest coworker's, they made work fun. The hardest part was when a client came in with an issue that couldn't be resolved due to the time constraints of the return/exchange policy. Most of the time the client's understood but there were always a few who became quite upset about the time constraints and other limits. The most enjoyable part of the job was the regular clients. They were usually happy to be there and made my day even better. Management was continually changing so it made for a huge lack in communication which caused problems that could have been resolved easily if there were more stability in the management positions."
good,Working here has shown me how staying flexible is key. Dealing with customers issues and keeping calm when a customer is angry is huge to calming them down as well.
good,Best Buy focuses mostly on customer service and sales. Hardest thing is keeping up with company expectations and goals. Easiest thing is getting comfortable with customers.
good,"While being a customer service specialist at Best Buy, I've learned how to resolve issues quickly and efficiently, use clues in body language to further help customers, and practice proper sales techniques that wow management. A typical day consists of me processing returns and exchanges, answering phones, and even checking people out. My coworkers try their very best at everything and we all work together very well. Being team-oriented is very important to us. The hardest part is knowing that sometimes, you can't make everybody happy. It's your effort that truly counts, though. My favorite part of the job is processing orders. I'm very good with computers so I can manage it quickly and leave my customer very satisfied."
good,Great Co-Workers and the great discounts will make you want to stay and make many people comfortable in this job. Advancement is different based on the store location but is nearly impossible to move up big in the Pembroke Pines location in a short amount of time. Co-Workers are great and they become sort of like family. You learn a great deal about whatever department you are working in. The hardest part about the job is dealing with rude/nasty customers and sometimes favoritism is played with management. The most enjoyable part of the job is working along side your co workers and the amazing discounts you get. Overall a great store to work for and an amazing job to get you through school and if you wanted to move to management it may take 5+ years but it may be worth it. Pay for management is great.
good,Best Buy is a good place for a part time job or even full time while you attend college. This company isn't growing and not providing many chances for advancement. Usually this opportunities occur because somebody found a better job.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Good place to work but the focus is too heavy on sales vs helping customers find what they need. I would still recommend the job to anybody though.
good,Fantastic products coupled with a great work to life balance. Management is to notch with a strong will to succeed in an ever growing market. Great job for a student or someone who enjoys technology.
good,There are constant learning opportunities within the company. I learned a lot about computers internally and externally that I never known. I learned special tips regarding sales that will help in my future employments.
good,"Managed the Prototype Building Plans."
good,"It is a great place to work, i recommend everyone work a retail job. If you are looking to advance in the company rather quickly, it would not be the place for you."
good,It was really enjoyable. I loved the technology environment.The people were very easy to get along with. The knowledge i learned was very useful.
good,"It is a very employee friendly environment. I learned a lot about products in the store in order to sell more and be informed about what we had to offer. I loved working there with some of the employees, other are just stubborn and do not realize what team work stands for."
good,"Fun, fast, yet less than acceptable pay, poor management, and less than effective means of specializing one's employment. Would still recommend this job to a friend."
good,"A typical work day would be coming in the morning stocking bags, making sure the coolers were all filled and that each register had what it need for the day before open. The atmosphere was very family like among my co-workers which is one of the things I enjoyed the most. I've learned how to properly stock merchandise and inventory. I've learned more about merchandise to be able to properly answer customers questions at check out. Although I loved my job the hardest part would have to be when other co-workers didn't do their job properly resulting in an upset customer."
good,The job is definitely not difficult by any stretch. I have learned how to read people alot better since this job and people are alot of fun customers and staff alike. The job sort of becomes difficult if everyone has alot of things going on. The hardest part of the job is when it its the holidays. The most enjoyable is the team that works here.
good,Great job for someone who wants to increase their knowledge about the latest technology.
good,"Easy enough place to work at great coworkers.  Only problem was pressure on sales of additional Best Buy products and if low on those sales you would receive less hours"
good,Great company to work for and perfect for college students. The flexible schedules help.
good,"Easily able to move up, opportunists apply.  Team environment."
good,"You have to be able to multi task. You don't always stay in your desired role, you will be expected to do other things that is not in your job description."
good,A fun place to work for anyone interested in technology. You get to see all the newest technology and help people choose what's best for their needs.
good,Best Buy is in the midst of the Renew Blue Transformation. Leadership is doing  the right things to transform the company.
good,"a typical day would be completing the morning paperwork. receiving incoming UPS and FED EX drop. making sure everything is accounted for, then onto the sales floor the products go. heavier items such as appliances and large TVs are stored in the warehouse and it is your job to carry it out to the customers vehicle. the hardest..well most annoying part of the job is when the Saturday truck comes in at 6am sharp filed with appliances and large TVs and you must account for them all and have them stored in the warehouse before the store is open. as for co- workers, I was friends with almost all of them. I kinda miss working there sometimes"
good,Great place to work awesome team of associates. Work life balance
good,Fun place with great people.  Low to moderate pay.  Unlikely to be fulfilling career.  Best for single or young people.  Very accommodating to personal life and great benefits.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy was an interesting job. It brushed off my skills as a salesman and simply how to communicate with people, on how to find the most suitable items for my customers and their families."
good,"Target  was fun. Customers can be mean or nice, but you always have those wild customers that make your job fun and interesting."
good,"I usually come into work and immediately begin my days with a walk through the store looking for any merchandise packaging that was left from the night before. Ensure that all safety issues are complied with, and any paperwork that needs to be handled for the other asset protection agents that will be coming in later. Hardest part of the job is knowing that if a theft occurs there is only so much I would be able to do per Best Buy policy. But I would have to say the best part of the job is the amount of friends I've made thus far and I hope I can make more in the future."
good,great place to work. great work environment. coworkers are pretty cool. its honestly a family when you work there
good,2 months ago it would have been 5 stars all around but at the Eagan location in which I work I applied to get a full time position and I didn't get it. Reasoning was I wasn't consistent enough. The a coworker got a promotion who is always flirting with the install guy and co workers and is wondering out of her zone which is frowned upon. The she gets on us when we do it once for 5 min. She will be gone for up to a few hrs at a time.
good,Just an overall fun place to work. Always kept busy. Management wasn't always great. If you have children I would suggest to work part-time.
good,Enjoyed working with all employees including supervisors and management.  Can get overwhelming at times including very long hours with early starts and late finishes and getting contacted on a daily basis including days off.
good,I enjoy working at Geek Squad overall. The people that work there are amazing and friendly. I enjoy the tasks that I perform and feel like I have some freedom to do things my own way within reason. There are opportunities to advance if you are willing to move around the store.
good,fun place to work with singing dancing and pool tables for those not interested in the gaming.we have different events through out the years.
good,"A typical day at work involves multitasking between the repairs, personal data and client issues of between 40 - 70 people at a time. I often find that an 8-hour shift turns to 10, turns to 12 and before I realize it, I've blown through an entire day in my attempt to successfully keep up with demands. The love of my co-workers and results-only mentality of a group of talented individuals looking to fulfill a purpose higher than just a paycheck is a community mentality that I am proud to say that I've contributed to. The most enjoyable part of being in the midst of the organized chaos of each day and the countless victories and lessons learned from the inevitable failures is knowing that I'll take that ability to foster growth within a team with me to all future employers and walks of life."
good,"Started in for the holidays and stayed on board. Great Co-wokers. Benefits are a little lacking but for a sales postion I feel the pay was fair. I felt harrased by one manager. Shed some light on it once. Not sure if anything was done about it, but I know it didn't really stop."
good,gets boring on slow days because you have to stay in your area of work with out much else to do besides running transactions unless you are needed somewhere else. people there are awesome. management is always pushing everyone to improve on their skills.
good,"Great overall environment."
good,just did customer service and transactions. scheduling was hard with me trying to cram 2 jobs and school.
good,"I loved working for best buy, other than the whole retail thing. Tey pay their employees well, always room to move up. However, they ""restructure""frequently, meaning loss of jobs regularlly."
good,Ok place to work. met some great people while working there.
good,"Best Buy is over all a good company to work for.  They care for their employees, are humble enough to go back and change mistakes they made, offer help for those who need compensation.  My store in spicific has seen its share of troubles, but with good people at the head of managment and co-workers who go out of their way to offer assistance, it is a secure and satisfying place to work."
good,"Working at Best Buy was a great experience for me as my passion in life has always been consumer electronics. Being around them so much only motivated me to study them even more just to increase my chances of furthering a career in the same area. My co-workers were all amazing people, most of which are still my good friends today."
good,"A typical day at work would being greeted by managers, associates, and customers. I learned that hard work does pay off. Managers were willing to go the extra mile to assist me with customers. Hardest part of the job was overnight stocking. Most enjoyable part of my job was providing solutions for the customers."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Typical day at work consisted of taking roughly 80 calls from various customers to assist them in many different ways, from sales to customer service to logistical issues. I learned a lot about the direct customer interaction sales associates have with their clients and a lot about the back end processes that need to be in place to make sure everything gets taken care of properly for both the customer and the company. My co-workers and management were the best resource I had with Best Buy, and the networking and brainstorming that can come from direct interactions can result in new opportunities for the company to strengthen and grow. The hardest part of my job was not having the opportunity to follow up with the customers I got to speak with each and every day, I really enjoy the satisfaction of knowing that a customer/client was able to get everything he/she was looking for and sometimes the role I was in would not allow for me to follow up with each customer to verify everything was taken care of. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I was able to work with a customer until the end to make sure he/she got everything they were looking for and that gave me a lot of gratification knowing I was able to assist them with everything they needed."
good,"A typical day at Best Buy would be making sure all of the products are in line and the store is ready for customers.  All paper work for the day must be filled out and the responsibilities have to be delegated for those coming in later on in the day.  Daily goals must also be reviewed. My immediate supervisor and I work together as a team to make sure the rest of the department is in track.  We are the seniors of the department and have the most knowledge.  I do have a good relationship with both of my store managers, communication is not an issue.  My co-workers and I also have great relationship as well, many of us participate in activities outside of the work place together which helps build our relationships.  The hardest part of the position I am in would be, being the stand in manager when my immediate manager is not there but I do enjoy the responsibility and being everyones' ""go-to""."
good,Loved the company - hated being a Catering Coordinator. The pay is ok and you can take home tips - but sometimes the hours are just not there. Moving up is hard and you don't see your management team very often.
good,helping people find ways to make life easier and finding the product that best benefits them.
good,it was a fun fast paced environment which gave me the right tools to succeed at any customer service job
good,"Buena empresa donde trabajé muy agusto"
good,"I enjoyed working for this company for almost 7 years as a manager. I like retail and enjoyed the people side of the business very much. However, I saw and experienced a lot of favoritism from the DM level and up. People that were liked excelled for the wrong reasons and were promoted even though they didn't meet the criteria."
good,"nice environment, stable hours, fun co workers, may get rude customers that think you're suppose to be a genius"
good,I really enjoyed this job. I just do not like sales. I got a chance to really get some supervisory experience.
good,"Best Buy is very customer focused. It is retail, but they do offer some great benefits. They do help with tuition reimbursement up to $3,500 a year. The employee discount is great too."
good,Fun enjoyable and management is good. Learned many things when it comes to selling. Hardest part of the job is during holiday seasons!
good,Was a great starting point for my career. Began as a seasonal associate & began to climb my way up. As a manager there were great experiences taking employees with no sales experience and making them top performers.
good,A good place to work with friendly coworkers and supportive management. Flexible for part time work.
good,"Best Buy has a reputation for an ever changing environment, which I can say is completely accurate! With that said, I loved the constant change as it made the day to day exciting. Not to say there weren't challenges that came with that, but overall the company is great to work for. The people you come into contact with are some of the best in their field and it is inspiring to see what they can do/have done. If I have the chance to go back, I would jump at the chance as the company overall is wonderful!"
good,"I enjoy working there, but I received my degree in Networking and Communications Management. I do not want to work retail the rest of my life."
good,"Worked as a in home service technician, completing electronic repairs on various TV's. LCD's, Plasma and CRT's. Worked in a team setting dividing responsiblities and work around a geographical area"
good,"At Best Buy we continually work together to make work both fun and rewarding. We all strive to give the best service we can to our customers and make sure that we help them find what they are looking for. Managers are typically upbeat and have a strong desire to achieve success. Co-workers are generally positive and look to make the most of the time they have. The hardest part of the job is not being compensated at the same level of work that I perform. The most enjoyable part is talking to people, whether it is coworkers or customers."
good,This is a good place to work. They have many things for you to do while on breaks. They have a cafeteria that offers different food to eat everyday. It's very good too. It's a laid back kind of work place while the dress code is a little stricter than at other places it's not horrible.
good,They act nice at first but than it just turns into a place where managers walk around and the sales associates work their tails off.
good,Best Buy is a create environment to work at. It is a fun and easy work environment.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"a typical day in best buy mobile includes activating cell phones, talking to customers about all the products within the department, etc. My co-workers are mostly younger and very knowledgable of most of the products in the store. the hardest part of the job is working with disgruntled customers."
good,"A good entry level job, gaining vast knowledge of product that comes into the store."
good,"Always around the newest technology, and learning about it. The employees are kind, and the customers and be interesting. Although some of the management could use some work, they expect us to make sure the employees make sure that we get the customers the correct items that they need, but expect us to just sell every and anything regardless if they need it or not."
good,"a typical day at work, Unloading trucks can be a pain. The discounts are good, if your buying phone accessories or tv mounts. "
good,"If you can keep up with technology, you should have no problem fitting in at Best Buy. If you work on the sales floors, it can be very demanding work. But the overall experience with the store was a good experience."
good,"Only requires 32 hours a week to be full time, which includes tuition reimbursement."
good,"A typical day it work as a Multi-Channel Sales Associate is very busy. I help customers in store as well as over the phone in purchasing and finding out information about the latest products and services in today's advancing technological age. I've learned some of the best customer service skills come from being patient and understanding when it comes to customers, and there is never a problem that cannot be resolved. My managers at Best Buy have displayed great leadership and coaching, providing me the best example of how hard work pays off. I don't believe there is anything hard about my job because there is always a procedure that can be brought about to solve a problem. The most enjoyable part of my job is the culture of the workplace, where you gain knowledge but also have fun while being the best!"
good,Enjoying work at Best Buy really depends on your role and other employees at the store you work at.
good,Working at Bestbuy was a lot of fun. Since I worked in the mobile department I would spend lots of time with customers in getting their phone activated and working. I liked having that time with them to just talk about life with the customers. They would always have something good to bring on a conversation with. My team was also very energetic and ready to go each day. We all had goals to meet and we would find fun ways to accomplish these goals. The management was also helpful and a lot of fun as well.
good,"My typical day at work was usually spent talking to clients (calming some down) about technology questions or problems, hands-on repairing software and hardware issues for computers, tablets, and phones."
good,i work in the customer services department mostly but do help with geek squad providing technical help on computer or electronic equipment. Work around 33-40 hrs a week.
good,The lack of job security is very stressful but the job itself is very rewarding
good,"Working at Best Buy can be a fun and different learning experience. Depending upon who your management is work can be stressful or it can be an amazing experience to which not many others can compare. When I first started with the company my experience and general knowledge of electronics and technology was that of a novice. Now I'd honestly say that I'm what most would consider to be an expert when it comes to technology. When it comes to sales experience, there are many companies that call their employees ""Sales Associates,"" etc. but I can honestly say that Best Buy takes prides in making sure they train their employees to be the best. I've gained sales experience that will benefit me for a lifetime to come. For the most part co-workers all take pride in their job but their is always that one individual who just shows up to get a check. I've had my ups and downs with the company but overall I can honeslty say that I had fun while being the best..."
good,Loved the people I worked with.  Enjoyed all the changes that are always happening.
good,"• Set schedules; delegated employee duties"
good,"Really welcoming and diverse coworkers- you truly become family with them even after leaving the job.  Supervisors and Managers are mostly nurturing with few exceptions. GM is clueless.  "
good,They atmosphere made it fun to go to work sometimes it doesn't even feel like work great place to work I wish I had worked at a different Best Buy with more understanding Managers.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Dealing with clients on the phone most of the day. Letting clients know whats the status of there repair orders. Giving out technical advice to clients on what to purchase or repair. Making all the paper work is filed and updates. Ensuring the clients unit's are being repaired or being worked on. "
good,"*met extraordinary people "
good,"Its not bad, a lot more sales work then fixing computers sadly and they overcharge for everything geeksqud does!"
good,Good job. Liked my time there and the employee discount is awesome.
good,"Best buy is a good place to work but not so great as a career option.  A typical day at work evolves a lot of walking and talking to people.  I get to talk about things I like; TVs, appliances, cameras, computers.  I have to push credit applications and service plans.  I also get to coach my peers in how to be good sales people.  I love working with my crew but my manger is all business and will lie to get what he wants out of you."
good,"Overall I have enjoyed working at Best Buy. The people I work with, including management, are all nice and easily approachable. The sales floor is fun and informative. They will pay for you to take classes if you are full timer, which is nice."
good,just like any job. the management is not that good at keeping the moral up of the workers but the friendly atmosphere that we have with our fellow co-workers.
good,"A typical day would include constantly greeting and providing assistance to customers.  Keeping track of sales and also periodically placing product on sales floor.  I learned to approach customers easier and also how to recommend products and services.  Management in other departments were good, but in mine the manager would constantly disappear in the back room leaving fellow employees to work together to get through the day. It was a fun job, all the employees worked well together and would help each other out.  Overall it was a good experience."
good,"Job consisted of assisting customers with any wants or needs. Specifically in the Cellular business, as I worked with Best Buy Mobile. Definitely learned how to multi-task, be very patient and how to manage my time with the customer being helped and customers waiting for assistance. Luckily, our team did not rely much on management unless it came to overrides at the cash register or with a customer or employee that requests one. Very independent, able to be open and honest with the customer, and oversee your own work. The holiday season was the roughest part on us all with the hundreds of customers, under-staffing and long hours but we always had fun working together, with optimism and humor."
good,"In the life of a Technology Education agent your first priority is to assist customers with the tech they have. My responsibilities in any given day included; Finding clients to teach (often times a challenge since people want in and out), Gather their info to input it into our database (Name, number, tech), and then give them 15-20 minutes of education on their product. Other than teaching clients, the training of our other employees fell to me as well. It was my goal to coach and train them on not only the products in their respective departments, but to teach them selling skills. The management was fine. they didn't always give you the whole truth, but they kept it light and fun in the store, and 9/10 times had your back in a customer issue. My co-workers from Best Buy were great, and still they remain some of my best friends they are a great bunch. I hated that regardless of how i tried and i improved i never got the chance to even hit full time. they hold on to that like its gold. The best part of my job really was getting to work with the clients. i love to teach people new skills or talents that they never knew existed"
good,Best Buy is a really fun place to work if you are into all the up to date technology.  I enjoyed the customer atmosphere and my co workers. The downfall is advancement. The company is all the time restructuring so you can be promoted one day and the next that position is being eliminated and you are forced to start from the bottom again.
good,Approach customer and give a non-biased opinion on different product making sure to sale them the product that meets their need. Meet and make sales goals by suggestive selling and offering service. Fun and challenging job and meeting many different people.
good,Job work life is not the greatest. Training the associates are amazing. There a lot of deadlines which have to met but that's not the problem. The process to step an employee down takes way to long and it makes the store suffer for performance.
good,When I was working as Best Buy I learned a great deal about customer service and time management along with being able to work with some great people as far as managers and coworkers are concerned.
good,"The day consisted of walking around a small portion of the store offering assistance to customers. I learned a fair amount about computers while working there, and how to sell services. The management was great and usually very helpful. My co workers were sociable."
good,Was hired when the first opened up in Washington State.  Was promised quick promotions but upper management was being demoted at record speeds eliminating promotions for the rest of us as they took the positions we hoped to move into.
good,"This job (the Consultation Agent position in particular) is great if you're starting out. Basically, you walk in in the morning, and launch whatever you can get going before people show up. Then, a mixture of appointments and walk-ins will show up throughout the day, your job is to help them identify the problem, and sell the solution. If they've already been sold the solution, usually a Tech Support subscription, you either check in the their computer for work, process the paperwork to have it sent out to be fixed, or perform some fixes on the bench."
good,"•	Lead, inspire, coach, and energize a team of 5 employees to provide excellent customer service"
good,"Gives you access to great knowledge and skills. Great atmosphere to learn, but not a great place to advance your career."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Typical day included providing timely coaching and training to reinforce sales behaviors while performing the role of Customer Experience Leader. Provided input to direct reports regarding opportunities within their team in suport of business goup plans.  Oversaw Inventory Integrity, Multi-Channel sales, Functinality of store systems, Asset Protection, Self Delivery, Back Office, Geek Squad Precinct and Auto Bay, .  Excellent partnership with district leadership. I had a great bunch of co-workers that made the work environment enjoyable.  The part of the day that I most looked forward to was the daily interaction with our employees and meeting customers."
good,"50 hours per week"
good,"great work place, friendly staff, great place to work if your doing call center.."
good,Working at Best Buy is a fun place to work and you learn many things about different products.
good,"I was a part of updating the stores with the latest and greatest technologies available to the consumers. This required many days, weeks and months of traveling and bouncing from day to night shifts; which took its toll mentally and physically on many employees in that line of work. The management team emphasized the on a ""family first"" mentality. Wherever the team was located, employees would be sent home for a family emergency. It was difficult being away from home that long throughout the year but completing our work and taking pride in our accomplishments at each location helped diminish a portion of that regret."
good,Builds business acumen and the people I work with are good people.
good,Great coworkers fun and upbeat workplace.  Learned teamwork and how to manage and supervise.
good,Best Buy is a good company to work for. Especially if you are a college student. The scheduling is very flexible and most managers are willing to work with you as far as availability.
good,The best part about working at Best Buy was the people. Great customers and friendly coworkers.
good,"Sell mobile phones and products."
good,Great team and work environment.  Excellent training and keeps me up with new technologies.  Management is very supportive also.
good,Great Work environment learned a lot and had a great manager and team to work with. management is amazing as well. Only downside the hours/ advancement is lacking.
good,"I spent the last 4 years working for best buy and up until recently it was a great company to work for with great compensation.  The pay was good and the environment was friendly and fun, however, recent cuts made it difficult and nearly impossible to advance."
good,"Through out my almost 8 years at Best Buy, I have learned to have fun while being the best along with being patient. I have also improved in staying organized and being a multitasker!"
good,"Overall a fun and challenging place to work.  However, they work in silos and many of the different business teams don't communicate with each other very well.  Many key business initiatives overlap and can be difficult to navigate when senior management is not in 100% alignment with strategy and budget."
good,"On a daily basis each customer with hunger for new technology, knowledge of this technology, and demonstrations of said technology must be fed. With the experience I have acquired working at BestBuy, I am able to unbiasedly inform the customer with a solution to meet their needs. I also became a sales leader: helped train other employees, merchandise departments, while leading in sales and productivity. The hardest part of the job would probably be dealing with customers who were mis-informed with false information. Either from other employees, or stores who lacked the correct knowledge. This becomes easier to resolve with the proper experience and characteristics you gain which are necessary to satisfy an irate customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is when customer's display their satisfaction of service through comments left on surveys submitted online. I consistently led my department in customer reviews."
good,"Wasn't too bad of a job, nice co-workers, easy to learn skills, pretty nice discounts."
good,"Great teams changing the world, daily, weekly, monthly"
good,Best Buy is still number one in electronic retail stores and the work place remains the same.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Work is fun, people are great, technology is exciting. Customers can be a drag, supervisors are fun and down to earth, you learn a lot about sales, it's an exciting place to work."
good,"A typical workday consisted of greeting customers, and guaranteeing customer satisfaction to the best of your ability. Managment are reliable, easygoing and understanding. Security ensured a safe enviroment on a daily basis. Coworkers were fun to work with and were very knowledgable about the job. The most exciting part of the job was someone walking out the door with a smile on their face and knowing you were apart of that. I enjoy making people happy and changing frowns into smiles."
good,I really enjoy talking and interacting with different types of people.
good,"Stood at the front door, greeting and checking receipt purchases."
good,"At Best Buy being a sales support associate I had many different work days. My work days were either filled with unloading a truck, separating merchandise, and stocking it on shelves; or I had come in to work carry-outs, OMS (pretty much the basis of this is merchandise that we find and go shopping for the customer when the customer is online), as well as other duties. Being in this job code I learned many different skills that would make a normal resume stand-out. We do everything from UPS, OMS, PRC's, Brightstar, Recycling, Certifications, and Inventory just to name a few. "
good,"Not a long-term career choice from me, I found that this is a good place for High School students/ college students but not for adults."
good,best Buy by far is a superior comapny for any person in the market for electronics. It has a dedicated track record for training and educating employees with a proven record for taking care of customers.
good,"As an inventory manager I was responsible for specific areas within the store relating to sales, warehouse operations, merchandising, customer relations and inventory control.  "
good,"Everyone is easy to talk to and get along with, train you well by doing alot of role play, alway fun to give your knowledge about products to customers and even employees at time."
good,Working for Best Buy was fun. Home Theater was a very interesting postion with a huge amount of customers. Was able to be one of the best sales associates in my department.
good,Workplace is loaded with positive and hardworking employees.  Great culture.
good,"working retail is tough, but with Best Buy you have some fun doing it."
good,Worked with great people and had a great time doing it.  Very casual environment with opportunities for advancement.
good,"Gained experience in sales, merchandising, product process and loss prevention."
good,I learned a lot about selling to customers and about working in a warehouse and stocking the sales floor.
good,"A typical day of work consisted of constantly interacting with customers and trying to find the right products for them. Closing duties at night time such as restocking and making sure the product was arranged properly were also done. I learned selling skills and how to interact with customers and find what they are looking for. My co-workers were fun for the most part, but you don't really get to interact with them much due to the fact that most of your day is spent with customers. The hardest part of the job is trying to make sure you meet your sales goals. It's very stressful and makes you realize there is a big difference between pushing and offering. The most enjoyable part of the job was using the cash register, i just found it fun and easy for me to do and understand."
good,"Very fast paced, fun working environment, lots of interaction, If you enjoy helping customers this is a fun place to start a career in sales"
good,Followed protocols and requests as per demand. Worked on different electrical as well as electronics devices. Hands job on each task. Trained many associates.
good,They have made changes in the last year or so that have made the company competitive again. It was beneficial for me to work here and observe these changes for my future endeavors. I gained much business knowledge working at BBY.
good,"I wear many hats in my current role, management allows me to work remote based on overall channel experience, productivity, and proving myself to the broader leadership team.  I have learned to collaborate with many business units in the Enterprise resulting in a great customer and sales experience.  I enjoy learning new roles and working as a team overcoming challenges."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"My time with Best Buy was short.  I enjoyed working with many of the employees.  A few seemed arrogant but that is not unusual."
good,"A pretty smooth typical day. Clock on, and sell product or demonstrate product for customers. On down times you would clean up the department, stock product, etc. Can learn quite a bit, and they promote learning and finding information you are seeking on your own. Management can be very laid back and relaxed, also push very hard to meet those sales goals. Co-workers for the most part were always amazing and never really had any issues with them. The hardest part could be the attachment rates, making sure you meet all those sales goals. As the most enjoyable parts would be the customers you would meet and get to spend time with. Especially when they would come back for you and only you. Its always great to see a fellow co-worker approach a customer you previously worked with that is waiting for you to finish what your doing and the customer blows off the associate. Once your done the customer goes directly to you."
good,Even though I've only worked here for a few months. The job was fun and energetic. Meeting and helping customers with questions about our products and overall quality of the merchandise.
good,"I was one of those who loved the Blue Shirt until I was promoted to Corporate.  I will never again in my life work in a corporate environment.  Others may like it, I didn't and it cost me my career."
good,"An incredibly fast paced environment with excellent employees and quality management. A typical day revolves around budgeting, forecasting, tendering, and monitoring projects with tight timelines and high dollar values. The largest challenges are completing the projects with the timelines given yet the most enjoyable part is seeing them completed."
good,The flexible hours are great for college students. You get to learn about all the products and communicate that back to the customer.
good,"I would come to work and get the keys from the lock box and go count the products that were on my morning check list. We also had a check list for night time. then after that make sure everyone has there sets of keys and walkies that they needed. Then open the store and greet customers and direct them to the proper place in the store. While doing that always being in communication with the other employees and management as well if there was any ""suspicious"" activity with anyone. That meant watching the cameras and being the ""eye in the sky"" for the store. Along with that I would also be checking the products that were leaving the store to make sure they got rung up correctly..(mostly for TV's, Computers Gaming devices, IPods, Phones). Making sure the Skues all matched up, that type of stuff. I loved working with the people there. we all became very good friends. Even to this day some of us are still friends. Management was for the most part very good, I liked most of the managers and the one I didn't really like were for different reasons. The hardest part of that job was getting tricked by people who stole from you on your shift. Or if someone got away with it. but the most enjoyable part was being able to stop someone who was trying to steal from the store!! I learned a lot from that job, I learned how to deal with different customers and when to get a manager involved or when I can deal with the situation. I learned that you sadly cant trust everyone. I learned what to look for in situations and people if they are about to do something bad."
good,a typical day in mobile consist of dealing with customers who may have been told false information via carrier or miss informed employees. Sometimes dealing with customers issues are simple but than one out of ten customers you get that one out rage customer. the out rage customers i love to turn the not so happy experience to the best experience of their life. By the management team allowing me to make certain decisions to better the brand is a very important to me. Having my peers seek to me for advice or to assist them with situations they may be having makes me feel like i have a place within the company. The hardest part about working in retail is working through the holidays. I don't mind working its just sometimes you miss out on the family moments. The most enjoyable moment of my job is knowing i help a customer understand something such as cell phone plans. Meaning they know a few more things leaving the store than what they came in knowing.
good,"Working at Best Buy's Geek Squad is a rewarding place to work.  The people I work with are extremely friendly, because we all get to do what we love, work with computers.  We're trained well, and it's nice to be at a store that sells every brand so we can be as unbiased as possible when talking to clients.  Having worked there for an extended period of time, I've established my own client base who really care and listen to the diagnoses that I provide and ways to fix their computer problems.  They tell me I'm honest and unbiased, that's what I try to be."
good,Driving sales and engaging customers to fuse them with the best technology and services to improve their lives. Motivate and develope associates to provide the best customer service possible.  The most enjoyable part of my day was meeting customers needs while giving them a warm and positive experience.
good,I was a delivery driver and management had me set up my own routes and let me drive the truck as needed and pick the person I was working with. The hardest part about my job was the distance we had to travel sometimes on a daily basis.
good,"A typical day at work entails my coming in and doing one of our four ""zones"". These are known as CSA (Customer Service Agent), CA (Consultation Agent), OA (Operations Agent), or ARA (Advanced Repair Agent). My primary zone of ARA means that I eradicate infections from computers that have been checked in by our CA's, unless of course they are busy, in which case I would be their back up and help with Clients at the Consultation counter. Same applies with CSA's who deal with returns, but also require help if their line is overwhelming. OA's are the most paperwork oriented agents, who deal with contacting clients with updates and pickup appointments. As an ARA and Geek Squad employee for several years, I have become a kind of ""Go To"" agent in all areas. I am able to work all areas, so job security, in my case, has not been a worry. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with computer issues and problem solving, but I also greatly enjoy the fellow employees. The hardest part is managing all that must be done, especially when so much is expected. The culture is very powerful, as we are given tools for the job that explain the history and culture of the position and also the definition of what it means to be a Geek Squad Agent. I have thoroughly enjoyed working for this company but feel that as an individual I need to start to branch out to further my employment and choose a larger career in the IT world."
good,"Every job has its downs. The only time there's ever a down is when you get that one customer that isn't happy with whatever it may be. That's the worst of it though, as long as you don't let people get to you it's not too hard of a job."
good,Been with this company for a little over 7 years.  Great company to work for only issue I have is not promoting from within the store.  Managers are not focused around employee development.
good,"•	Build strategic business plans to ensure financial growth. "
good,Fun job with tons of great people. Must like working with people and be able to smile in difficult situations. A lot of independent work and problem solving skills are a must!
good,"They are all about working in teams, and strong with sales and informing costumers about new products, helping them make informed buying decisions instead of them buying strictly based on the price."
good,"A typical work day, would be stocking store products and assisting customers."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced, high energy with an upscale atmosphere.  Everyday brings new ways to learn through hundreds of e-learnings available online.  Management is supportive and they work directly with personnel.  Co-workers are ranged from 17 years of age and up and offer a broad spectrum of different cultures.  The hardest part of the job is accomplishing everything in one shift with the amount of hours provided.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping others learn what you have learned and seeing everyone work as a team."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I start my day off by coming in, checking email, seeing if there is any new training certifications to complete, and making sure the store is clean and ready for the work day. "
good,"Best Buy is a fun environment to work and grow in.  I have amazing co-workers and the management is dedicated to helping you grow within the company.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with customers and fellow co-workers.  From working at Best Buy, I've learned how to properly serve the customer as well as handle irate customers.  The hardest part of my job is having to deal with unreasonable customers while still trying to provide them with the best solution possible.  "
good,Best Buy is a good company to work for. Busy most of the time. definitely learned a lot of new stuff: cool stuff. Managers are not always on the same page with operations and procedures and chain in command. co-workers are more than willing to help you learn your way around the store. Everything is easy until you know what your doing; follow manager instructions and you will do fine. The hardest part of the job is dealing with managers. Most enjoyable is meeting new customers and bring them for more new and exciting technology.
good,"The best part of my day was talking to customers, and keeping myself up to date with the latest technology."
good,"A typical day involves working on client computers trying to solve the various issues that these units might have. All well answering their questions on PC problems that might not be so serious."
good,"I had several different roles when I worked at Best Buy. I started out working as a cashier, then I went into inventory (warehouse), next up was the media department with all the video games, music and movies. After doing that for a while, I went into home theater. "
good,"Daily sales interactions with customers, setting up installations, offering multiple services and providing customer support after the sale."
good,"Answered phone calls, placed orders, maintained pickup area. I learned a lot about technology and how it connects into our lives. The co-workers were fun I just didn't do well with the mentality of some of the managers. I most enjoyed learning about technology."
good,The store is very customer oriented. I never had a bad day or night working there. The management was very good to their employees. The hardest part I guess for me was learning bout electronics. I didnt know too much about them until I worked there. They make it easy to train in your department.
good,"Working for the Geek Squad was a pleasant experience. Fortunately, you need not any experience with computer repair. Best Buy will pretty much teach you everything you need to known. Although, with any job, you will get overly stressed from time to time. If you're a good people person then it would be a ""cake"" job for you. "
good,Always lots of fun when you walk through the doors. Its a retail environment and you need to be extremely flexible with your availability. Over the years I've learned that retail is changing and you need to be able to adapt to survive. I have created relationships with fellow associates as well as customers that I will last a lifetime.
good,"Typical day consisted of sales, installs, and scheduling appointments with customers.  You will learn the ins and outs of every car, as well as how to use a variety of tools.  The most enjoyable part is the laid-back atmosphere of the install bay."
good,"Best Buy is a fun to place to work if your into Technology. Some look at it as a Toys ""R"" Us for adults. During my time working for the company the management teams have helped me become a better leader and team member. As with any company you have co-workers who want to be there and other who don't. The trick is to coach all workers the same and the ones who want to be part of the team will catch on and grow with the company and the ones who don't will find somewhere else to work. The hardest part of my job would be keeping up with all the new technology. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be training somebody of their new technology and having them walk out the store feeling good. "
good,Selling the latest and greatest in technology.  High paced sales with lots of customer interactions everyday.  Up to 8 hours day standing and moving around while greeting customers.  Working with other knowledgeable associates who have received some of the best training's offered.
good,"okay place to work but the best part is the discount"
good,"The work was hard at times, long hours, and hard on the body. Did various jobs in warehouse but loved working as material handler. I worked steady and cleaned my area. "
good,"I had a great time working with my employees and working to develop them into more productive units of the retail machine. I learned alot but most importantly learned that the relationship between manager and employee is both delicate and highly important. Motivation through mutual benefit is also key, finding the benefits and illustrating them properly is my talent. "
good,"Focus is beginning to come to Best Buy, which will help them regain the financial success they once had."
good,"*fast and productive"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Depending on the position you would have a number of tasks whether its selling, customer service, or picking orders. I gained great knowledge on selling and how to work with people. The people are great there especially co workers.  "
good,The best part about working at Best Buy is that you'll gain retail experience with selling just about everything and trying to help the customer over anything. You'll be pushed out of your comfort zone which is exactly what I needed. I learned how versatile I was. Working at this Best Buy was a good experience because the management staff was amazing. They made the job much easier to enjoy and kept us on task at all times while teaching us how to be a good businessman as well.
good,Best Buy has some of the best perks in retail and some great people work there.  Training is top-notch and there is always something new to learn.  The only problem is getting any hours.  Much like most retail you will get anywhere from 12 to 20 hours most weeks unless you are full time.
good,"Fun place to work for college/high school kid."
good,"Fun, fast paced work environment.  Typically college-aged employees.  Most enjoyable part of the job was to be around new technology/consumer electronics every day and being the first to know about the latest and the greatest."
good,"At Geek Squad I started out as a Customer Service Agent. Throughout my time with the company I did many lessons and hands-on cross-training which would allow me to work in other positions throughout GS. I was now able to work with my teammates and complete more tasks now that I had more knowledge in the precinct. I then became a Consultation Agent, which actually deals less with customer service returns & exchanges and more with fixing clients' computers. The management at each of my stores was fantastic and motivational. The hardest part of my job is not being able to find a solution. Sometimes with today's technology there isn't always an answer. You have to tell a client, ""this isn't compatible with your device,"" or ""this is as much as I can help you with, with the tools I'm provided with."" This is often frustrating to both the client and the employee. However, the satisfaction I get from seeing ""it click"" makes that part of my job easy to overcome. When clients come back in to the store and show me what they've learned from a session with me, I feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. That's my favorite part of this job. Making people's things work for them."
good,I learn a lot of great new ways to interact with customer and build a fun and energetic work environment. 
good,"Best Buy is a solid company to work for, they value their employees"
good,"I enjoyed working here until the store closed (Manteca, CA), the management was very knowledgable, helpful, and easygoing. They were very willing to work around my school schedule and I had time to be with my family as well."
good,"Working in Best Buy Mobile was quite the experience for me. I worked in the Bellevue location and so was able to meet some very influential people. I have a passion for technology and bringing those who would like to utilize what is available by helping them find exactly what can help them in their lives. My co-workers were very knowledgeable, far more than I had assumed, and our managers were a good mix of upbeat and get-things-done type of people. The one thing that drove me crazy with this job was having to close since I could not determine a specific time I would be able to go home. Being a student this interfered with me getting my homework done and also my sleep schedule. Overlooking that fact however, working at best buy for sure has to be best job I've had so far."
good,Goof people to work with.  Company could have a better work life balance.
good,"I worked very hard for this company with the hopes of advancing to a supervisor position. I worked for Best Buy almost three years in the Mobile department, and at the two stores I worked at, I was one of the hardest workers, never late, always reliable, and applied for a lead position two times that it opened up, and neither time I got the position - although I did have to train the person who did get the position. The pay at the job was very good, and I had good job security, but I thought the management had favorites and was unfair. The job wasn't hard; it was a typical customer service/retail job. The people I worked with were very nice and I got along with them all."
good,Best Buy has a lot of great amenities on the main campus like a bank and Caribou
good,"I worked in the Wireless department. Each department gets their monthly allotment of ""hours"" based on the amount of $$ that department brings in. So if you have a bad month, your department can hurt and your hours get reduced."
good,Everyone here was very plesent to work with and for they care about there employees and coworkers
good,"While working at Best Buy, I have developed skills in delivering excellent customer service, being team-oriented, enhancing communication amongst staff, and using analytical thinking. The management team seeks to empower their employees and help develop their leadership skills. They do not show any type of favoritism and treat all employees as an equal. Not only is the management team great at their job, but so aren't my co-workers. All the employees at Best Buy never turn their cheeks when another employee is in need of help. There is a great atmosphere in the store amongst staff due to the collaborative and interactive environment. Everyone works as a team knowing we all have to contribute to hitting our business goals."
good,"I was a cashier for the Christmas season. People were nice, the job was nice enough especially considering that it was only a seasonal job"
good,"Company is great, just salary that sucks. Good people, willing to help you with anything."
good,"the associates i worked with there were great. learned to be more outgoing with people, very diverse area of the city. alot of fun sometimes, especially the four hour shifts."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,• Maintained a positive business relationship with customers to ensure customer loyalty and retention.
good,"clock in at 7 a.m., 5 days a week. daily route (calls for the day) upload. Call customers to inform them of my visit to their home with a 2 hour window. Make sure Van is clean inside and out. Once arriving at customer home , I insure customer of 1st time repair.Then hardest part of the job is when I cannot complete repair on the first time. Most enjoyable about this job is meeting people and getting the repair done the first time!"
good,"Conducting sales meetings, meeting with customers assisting in sales,and also training"
good,Management can be a bit strict with sales goals and your work hours will reflect accordingly.
good,Great opportunity to develop your professional skills. Most days I work to solve complex issues that utilize all of my skills. You get really good at negotiation and management of others expectations.
good,-Great atmosphere and people
good,A typical day was meeting customers and making sure that they could walk out working with everything they need for their new cell phone. I enjoyed most of my co workers. The management was very rough and did not do much other than get mad.
good,"Although selling electronics was not exactly my niche, Best Buy was one of the best working experiences I've ever had. I still keep in contact with managers, co-workers & even customers from the location I was at (Chelsea, New York). I left there with a lot more information that when I started there-which was absolutely nothing. I can truly say that if I wanted to work there again, I would."
good,"I really enjoyed this job, I worked in the warehouse and inventory area. The pay was good and everyone did their job and then some. Management seemed to have everything moving like a well oiled machine and every day was pretty much stress free. The only reason I left was because after the season I was cut to 8 hours a week with no real hopes of 30+ like I had been promised. The best part about the job was the fact that everything flowed very well. I'd have to say the worst was the hours cut after the season. They had laid off the seasonal workers and kept me but gave me almost no hours."
good,• Developed the Appliance sales program from the ground up
good,Started out in the warehouse. Then within the month got promoted
good,"Only worked seasonal for the holidays. Required some level of customer service as well as understanding of computers for the Geek Squad. You are required to understand their online database of all the store products as well as work orders. Everything can be done from the computer from checking up purchase history, to checking work orders for clients, anything really. Was some positive experience in a retail environment. Typical day would be to reproduce problems with electronics that customers have and offer solutions and services to resolve the problem."
good,"I was employed with this company while I was in high school. I remember my team members, in department, excluding me most likely because I was the only female in the department and I was also the only minor in the department. The management wasn't the best, it was like a boy's club. Our discount was pretty good and we received a few perks when promotions began in the store."

good,"I enjoyed working for Best Buy, the co-workers will help you if you need help and fun environment"

good,A great place to work. A retail company on the edge of technology. Always selling the newest and best products Learned all about the current technology and lifestyle of people.
good,Great place to learn about retail and to use creativity to solve challenges.
good,"At the time I worked there, they only hired part-time employees. However, if you work there long enough, you may become a full-time employee with benefits. The work environment is great. Management is helpful in training employees to be able to do their jobs well. The pay is a little meager, but over time this could become a great career."
good,"a typical day at work is fun and a burst of energy, you learn how to deal with a lot of different people, also the management team are to be around so is all the co-workers the hardest part of the job is to tell a customer that what they are looking for we dont have in store, one of the most enjoyable part of the job is giving a customer his/her new a phone and to see the smile he/she gives you in return"
good,Enjoyed helping consumers learn to interact with people and do daily task. Working with my co-workers was a great enjoyment. Hardest part of the job but also the most humbling part was seeing that these consumers had problems that i would not wish upon anyone. It really makes you realize how blessed you are as a person to do the little things like work tie your shoe. Management would work beside you and not only just boss which was a good thing.
good,"Interesting, but very fast paced as technology is always changing."
good,Overall a great company to work for. If your looking for a great retail job look no further.
good,"Fast paced, very social, interact and meet different people"
good,"Long days and a rotating schedule. It is not a bad job, but it is hard to have a home life."
good,Typical day at work is dealing with customers and putting merchandise on the floor. That or working security all day. Management is lacking a backbone to follow rules but all are very friendly and kind. The hardest part of this job is waking up and lifting a few heavy objects. the most enjoyable part of work is the so-workers and getting to see the end results.
good,its great for being a retail giant. they treat their workers like people. the pay is not too good. but i would like my 18 year old kid to work there. its a good starter/college job.
good,"I enjoyed working for Best Buy a lot, and think they have a Strong Ethics and Core Values, but was very unsatisfied with the overall Pay Structure. I geuss that comes with the Territory of Retail, but I feel like their could be strong Compensation for its Employees. They do a lot of promotion with-in though which is encouraging."
good,Retail industry so hours are not family friendly but good benefits and they often recgonize good employees. Advancement is good.
good,"Before i started i'd have to wait in the lunch room with co-workers, for the manager to come and get us to start. Then we would place the pallets in order. Then we would stack the items on the pallets up to six feet. Witch was like 24 pallets for each truck, depending on how buisy of a day it was. Then we would wrap the pallets and load them on the trucks. I learned how to be more quick on my feet. We had to move fast if we wanted t get out of work early. The manager's were really nice and down to earth. The co-worker's were nice and patient. The hardest part of the job was picking up the big screen plasma t.v's by myself. The most enjoyable part about the job was interacting with the co-workers."
good,"Best Buy’s Values are: Have Fun While Being the Best; Learn from Challenge and Change; Show respect, humility and integrity; Unleash the Power of Our People"
good,"As an MCSA our main duty was to answer all incoming calls to the store. Calls consisted of customers asking if product was in stock, how to work it, placing an item on hold or ship to home, return policies and questions about repair services. When customers called about product stock I would inform them of its availability and if they would like the product held or shipped to their home. Depending on the product I would talk to them about applicable accessories or services plans. The MCSA secondary duty was to ring out guests for the items I held or items they ordered online for in store pick up. I would great the customer, enter their information into the system and depending on the product speak to the customer about applicable attachments and service plans. Management and coworkers were always willing to help out when needed and it always felt like a team environment. The hardest part of the job was juggling multiple phone calls and in store guests waiting for pick up. When I first started there was no phone queuing system and I would juggle multiple calls by parking them on different lines. Eventually Best Buy upgraded to a system that queued making our job easier and making customers happier. What I enjoyed about this job was always being busy by having two lines of customers, one on phone and another in store. I also enjoyed being able to speak to so many people and getting to know them in order to get the correct product, attachments or services they needed."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Typical Day at work consists of helping customers pick out and activate new cell phone devices.
good,"Working in this type of fast pace environment you have to be top of your game. I enjoyed unloading trucks, shipping products, having fun with fellow co workers. Since working I've learned the in's and out's to shipping and receiving, processing of unloading product, loss prevention, cycle counts, etc. Overall with the right team and training this will be a very successful position for anyone"
good,Typical day would include installation of speakers and decks
good,"I was in the media department and my job consisted of stocking the shelves continuously while ensuring every customer was helped with any questions they may have. I learned a lot about the retail industry at Best Buy. It was pretty easy to get along with co-workers. For they most part the hourly employees are going to be around the same age. Multitasking is a must. You never know how many things you'll have to do at the same time, or how busy the store might be. Most days were pretty enjoyable just because of the people you worked with."
good,"I enjoyed working at Best Buy. I gained some great experience being able to work in so many different positions. I got along well with management. The benefits were great. Unfortunately my store got closed down, but it did allow me the time to work on finishing my schooling."
good,Learned a lot of sales techniques as well as keeping up with the new technology advancements.
good,"It was a great job when I had it. I had previously worked for Best Buy and I wanted to come back. Strong ethics and a great enviornment, some of the time. Management can be unstable at times due to pressure from corp. but other than that some great people work there and there is always a lot that needs to be done."
good,"I learned so many new things working for Best Buy, and was up to date on all the newest technology!"
good,"Its all about the customer & the employees. If we strive to keep our employees trained and happy, then our customers will be happy. Along the way I have met so many different and great people. Although the world of retail can often be trying and tough, the satisfaction of seeing happy employees and happy customers always makes it worth while."

good,Fun and great place to work for if you are in school and don't have a family.
good,loved everything about it. great memories. great company. great people
good,"Great start shift, co-workers were very approachable and would help teach about the process. Management would let us do our job on our own. As long as the work got done, they were happy. Hardest part about the job is being let go due to cut backs."
good,"A typical day at work consist of a massive load of work to get done in a timely manner, working in a fast paced environment. Co-workers are fun to work with, management could be better. Hardest part of the job is balancing work life and personal life. Working retail consists of long hours, always working holidays and not enough vacation time."
good,Good way to get experience from nothing. Hires up from within. Management is under a lot of stress and takes it out on you. Numbers are focused on with no compensation. An average sales day gets your scrutinized.
good,great company to workers was good managent was ok learned to operate my own business hardest part was when employees left that you trained enjoyable was teaching and coaching and the hours.
good,Best Buy was a good place to work. They value their employees and are flexible with work and school schedules. Overall a fun place to work.
good,"Was able to interact, teach and learn from people of all ages, backgrounds, races. It was a great experience to learn about all the upcomming technology, which appears to be the driver in the world these days. I loved being able to teach my associates about the ins and outs of the business along with learning from my peers on better selling strategies. The only downfall is all the negative chit chat and the ""blind eyes"" to company policies depending on who you are. When I transferred to the store in Big Flats the management team was not the best when it came to accepting you for who you are and had no problem talking smack about those either on the same level or below them. There is was a lot of drama in that store which led to a sour taste being put in my mouth, which was very disappointment considering I had been with teh company for so long and I felt as if I had created a Best Buy Family in my previous Best Buy but here it was as if I was back in high school where the rumor mill and popularity was on the agenda versus being a team and succeeding as one."
good,"Open store, Greet customers, Balance and set out all cash registers, Solve any customer issues, process payments. Answer phone promptly and professionally."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.

good,I have 5 years in best buy with no grow in site im given my best shot. Hopefully I can find a better job.
good,Typical work day would be to sell home theater solutions to customers. The full selling concept was very important in the retail level. Working with electronics was a real joy. Co-workers were really fun to be around which motivated me to do well. Hardest part of the job was giving your best sales pitch and the customer in the end not buying. Most enjoyable was doing what I did in something that I loved. Home Theater.
good,"A regular day of work consisted of shipping, and receiving packages. Filling out bills of laden for shipments, and filing daily paperwork. Also assisting customers with safely loading and or unloading large or heavy items into or out of their vehicles."
good,"Each day at work I got to meet someone new who would give me new challenges in making their lives better through technology. Over my years at Best Buy they gave me plenty of opportunity to grow in my knowledge around electronics both sales and technical, and also grew me as a leader and individual. I built plenty of friends within the workplace and would highly recommend the culture and environment to anyone who loves to work with people. Management for the most part is very motivating and cares about you as a individual. Most of the management team really cared about the work/life balance. The hardest part about the job is having to deal with difficult or angry customers, with limited options to help fix the issue at hand. Thankfully Best Buy offers many avenues to help get the customer solution quickly. The most enjoyable part on my job was seeing the end result of a sale/install and having a customer or client share their great experiences with you."
good,Everyday was a challange. I cross trained in every department in the store.
good,"I worked for this company for 3 years starting from the lowest position into a lead position. Very good company if you do your job right and follow the rules and guidelines. Repetitive at times, but you just have to change it up a bit sometimes. I built a great network with many people I worked with at this company including vendors and other support groups. Hardest part of the job and staying motivated for more than 2 years."
good,Best Buy Corp was a great place to work and that's why I stayed there for 14 yrs. It was a Result Orientated Working Environment that allowed employees to work anytime and anyplace.

good,"good company,good pay,some mangers are jerks,"
good,the people make the company a great work enviornment!
good,"Day to Day working environment is generally good. The customers are what determines the day. If customers are generally happy about their experiences they are more open to the suggestions and recommendation of the associate. A bad experience at another retailer or store can really hinder how well the associate is at overcoming objections and finding a solution that would best benefit the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you know you have done your all and the customer leaves the store will everything they need to make whatever the buy work for them. This includes how to use it, not just accessories."
good,a lot of opportunities to grow and learn
good,"I enjoyed working in a warehouse environment, place was clean and co-worker were great"

good,reatil is not for me anymore. looking for something better in welding.
good,"Working at Best Buy helped me to improve on my customer service skills since I dealt with so many customers from different walks of life. I worked in the returns department and had to deal with the most pleasant of customers to ones that were very rude. I loved the challenge of being able to help those that were rude and offer the most excellent service with a smile, because, most of the time, they would leave out on a more positive note."
good,Help return any items that did not fit the customers needs and help them get the products that best serve them.
good,"Lots of customer service, meeting sale and warranty goals, meeting many new people, activating new credit card"

good,Loved making the customers smile. Enjoyed learning how to work as a cashier.
good,Best Buy was a great company to work for. Minus the current position position restructure I enjoyed being a employee
good,"Best Buy, as a Supervisor, is about building a solid rhythm. Setting a strict agenda, mornings would consist of taking inventory of client and store items within the department. Reviewing customer and store queues within Best Buy systems. As employees come in, setting goals and tasking them during their shifts. Relaying any new company/department information as well as follow-ups for any opportunities or victories. Assisting employees with customer interactions to ensure clear communication and reduced client/employee disappoints. As well as on the spot training for any new electronic issues.

good,Really enjoyed working for best buy. everyone works as a team not only on a store basis but on a regional basis as well. great benefits. only thing i disliked were the hours but that how retail goes!
good,"A typical day at Best Buy would include walking around the store to help draw buisness into the mobile department and then processing phone upgrades and activations. I learned how to lead into a conversation pertaining to cell phones. Most of managment were very helpful and would go out of their way to make the store run more smoothly. The hardest part of the job was convincing people that were just looking for cds, to come and upgrade their phones. But it is also the most enjoyable part, because when you can get someone to not only buy that one cd they were looking for but also a brand new cell phone you leave work feeling very accomplished."
good,Best Buy is a great company that puts its employees in position to succeed. I've learned alot about business to consumer sales and how to be a great salesman.
good,"I have worked for Best Buy for almost 10 years. The training, and advancement opportunities, are outstanding. I have held multiple assistant manager positions, all of which I enjoyed, and had the opportunity to learn, as well as, be in a position to utilize my strengths, to make a positive impact. The work/life balance is absolutely the downfall, but I venture that is the case with retail management, with most, if not, all companies. I can say that Best Buy has literally given me the skills, and knowledge, to effectively run my own business some day."
good,best buy was an amazing place to work at. The training was amazing and the attitude was great. enjoyed working for best buy. learned alot of customer service and how to sell.

good,Bestbuy is one of the best jobs I have worked at. The environment in the store is an easy one to work in. Managers are easy going and are friendly but strict when need be.
good,"Best Buy is a good company to work for with competitive benefits and wages. The corporate campus has a lot of amenities that are convenient such as a day care center (New Horizon), bank, dry cleaning, and a work out facility. The culture is solid and the company is committed to living out its values."

good,"Despite the management issues our location had, I felt comfortable with how much I was being paid and the benefits provided to me for what was asked of me."
good,"Great coworkers and helped me grow as a professional early in my career. Helping the customers from their purchase, all the way through their install was fufilling"
good,"It's like working with your best friends every day, but management holds promotions over employees heads like carrots on a string, but the second you reach for the carrot, they bring up every tiny mistake you've made in some sort of attempt to make you the perfect employee.  It starts with actual mistakes until you've fixed them all, then it goes on to speaking out of turn or not being the example of a shining best buy employee out of work.  Posting adult humor on your facebook, or a slightly suggestive instagram post suddenly becomes taboo.  It's a great place for a high school student or someone straight out of post-secondary, but as an adult, it becomes a chore, not a job."
good,I received good leadership which I helped maintain good morale withing the company. Good teamwork between the staff and communication between staff and leadership.

There needs to be a better lead time in regards to inquiries being answered in a timely manner by different internal department at corporate head office. Need better opportunities of internal advancement
good,They are usually willing to work around your schedule. Pay depends on the department you work in. Great discount and diverse group of employees to work with.

good,"Competitive pay, around technology, good place to learn about technology.  also is has a decent culture and seems to be moving in the right direction as a whole."
good,Working for Geek Squad in a Best Buy store is a good starting place to get into IT. I learned a lot from this job and management is very dependent on your location. Some locations really encourage the Geek Squad culture and others don't even acknowledge it so everything varies. The best part of the job is getting to work with computers every day and solving these problems. The hardest part is handling the politics on occasion.
good,Best Buy is an incredible place to work for while attending school. They worked with my school schedule and were able to provide me all the opportunities I needed while at school.
good,It was a great workplace and a very friendly environment but the management was not very good. When I needed to transfer to a different location do to moving living locations they refused to transfer me even though I notified them when my move in date was and gave them all the necessary information they needed.
good,"typical retail store job "
good,Pro to bestbuy is how quick you can climb the chain of command. one con is that that means management changes a lot and sometimes for the worst. Not all raises help the store.

good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The fellow employees are very nice and helpful. I've learned a lot about how to interact with different people and help solve their tech problems. I also learned about security for the retail aspect.
good,"While Best Buy doesn't hold true to all of its values, they do stick by the ones that matter as a whole. After working in several different locations, it's clear to me that the Store Manager sets the tone and the happiness level of the workplace. That can be either a really good thing, or a really bad thing. My advice to you is that if your unhappy within a store, try a different one before writing off the company as a whole. There are a few gems in the mix of pretty rocks and the occasional piece of scat."
good,"Good training for new products rolled out. Good environment. Willing to work with life-situations. They however have a far-too-strict policy on tardiness TO life situations. Sure you can ask for a day off and get it, but heaven forbid a pet or family member die before your shift. Even upon submitting valid paper work, you may still be pointed!"
good,"I had a great run at Best Buy. Honestly being there wasn't that bad customer wise either. If you work your hardest its easy to keep making money. The commission is done as a bonus every month so you have to make sure the whole store is doing well. The only thing that I didn't like was towards the end of my employment there, they completely switched management. I would probably still be there if it wasn't for that"
good,"I loved working at Best Buy (store 523), but over a year in and tangible experience in almost every department, there was little room for growth and no sign of a pay raise until my second year. It was not a sustainable job for me, but the culture there, as well as the coworkers, was a great experience for me."
good,Everyone is so great. They taught me lots about management and fairness. I  never had any doubt that this would be a good place for many people to start a career and a life long one at that. My only reasoning that I want to leave is that this isn't my life long career.
good,"Best Buy was a great place to work, your co-workers are always great, the in-store management is supportive and definitely help the store operate efficiently. However, if you allow the employees to look at their sales figures, and gross profit, they're gonna realize really quick that they all deserve more money."
good,"My typical morning at Best Buy will be a brief 5 minute team boosting cheer, with discussions of daily targets and new product line. Which then leads to opening the store, greeting customers and providing them telecommunication services as well as general product information."
good,"The only thing I would consider a con would be the management due to lack of communication. Other than that, It's a great place to work, its not very stressful, and its a team effort."
good,"Working here has definitely been a learning experience about what was once my favorite electronics store. The management was laid back, but usually acted between nonchalant and furious. There was rarely any room in the middle. Due to their policies of being unable to work outside of their hours, they rarely reacted to my attempts on contacting them through phone calls and texts. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to see merchandise pre-release."
good,"I made alot of lifetime friends at Best Buy, even though I was only part time I still felt involved in every action taken by the store everyday. The events they plan outside of work and during work hours were a great balance between work and fun. Definitely recommend working for this company if you are looking for work in sales or experience with customer service."
good,Great people and there is something new to be learned everyday. I have worked at Best Buy for seven years and there are not many retail jobs I could imagine working for quite a time.
good,Ain't a bad place to work. It's a paycheck. The People are nice. The work's pretty easy going. You don't need a big huge technology background to get a job here.
good,"Did have a few fellow employees in the same area as me that were under performing, and still got promotions.   Little odd, feels like seniority outranks hard work.  But still a good company"
good,Not much Opportunity for people with ambition.The place is good for people who want smoth life and do not have desire to grow.The management does not welcome new ideas.
good,The people who work with you really become your family. I have worked at over 3 Best Buy locations and every time I leave I feel like I am leaving a part of myself.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Their training program is fantastic and the managers do a lot for you. There is give and take, but that is true of any retail job and in that, it is very fair. I love being able to help people with technological things and this job was able to provide that for me. If you're looking to start or continue your retail path, it's a great environment to get into."
good,"Working at Best Buy was super fun when I was at at my second store, great management who weren't just trying to force sales. My first store was the absolute opposite, management was always on me about not making extremely high sales goals and my ASM was a complete jerk. To the point where I did end up reporting him to my new GM once I moved stores. Overall a decent job experience but I left because I needed more money and more hours that I wasn't getting there."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work.  There is soo much to learn everyday.  Whether you come in with experience or not, you will definitely leave with more knowledge and experience.  The management that was there during the time I was working, were great people."
good,"A typical day at work is go in and clock in right away and start your work shift, be productive .what I learned was retail culture and experience. the management was really good and responsible. and It was a great job all the way around."
good,"Best Buy can be a pretty good place to work at as long as you have a good attitude. It helps the throughout the day when you're down stocking, helping customers, selling."
good,Working here will probably be the best job you have in your life aside from apple of course but realistically you are joining a family which I love about a job a place where you feel welcomed I just feel that theres way to many politics than needed in a job like this but realistically if you go to work. work then go home and actually try you shouldn't have no problems whatsoever.
good,Loved working the crazy hours with a group of fun people.  Only problem was them hiring unqualified employees instead of ones doing the job and qualified. Nepotism sure going on here.
good,It was a good workplace. I had a little bit of concerns about the salary but everything else was okay about it. I sometimes worked in shipping department and pick tower.
good,I love my job and what it provides me. The work is often steady and consistent while still allowing you opportunities to try new things. The only difficulty is that I have outgrown the responsibilities it allows me and am currently looking for upward mobility outside of what Best Buy can offer.
good,Best Buy was one of my favorite jobs.  The atmosphere is welcoming and family oriented.  With a good management team in place it can be very rewarding to work there.  They give you the tools and training to be knowledgeable in all things technology which can spill into your personal life improving with technological advances.  The pay is competitive for the industry they are in and it sure beats stocking shelves or food service.  If you are serious about advancement there is plenty of opportunity within the company to move up.  I would return there for employment if my new workplace didnt work out for some reason.
good,"Very relaxed atmosphere. As long as your daily goals are met, management is really laid back. Gets a little crazy during holidays, but that is like any retail place. Overall, a good place to work."
good,Overall best buy was a pretty good job I think that management could've been a little better there were employees that didn't do their job and therefore made it harder on the folks that did.
good,"Working at Best Buy is a great place to start your Customer service/retail sales career. However, it is still retail so the hours get crazy during holiday season."
good,"Best Buy is a great company to work for if it is your first job. Workplace culture differs between stores, but can be a fun place to work if store is doing well and management is engaged with employees."
good,"This job was a good start for my sales floor experience. Great atmosphere and co-workers. Management was great. A lot of help from co-workers on any questions and any problems you face at any point. For my first sales job, I loved it."
good,Good working environment with great team mates with whom you share a common goal. I had a good time with the company and developed so many good corporate relationships
good,Working at best buy was a wonderful experience. Getting to know different people while learning about technology was very interesting. The workplace environment was positive.
good,Best buy is a fun place to work that allows you to think of a bigger picture for a career. Best Buy allows you to have fun while being the best at what you do.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"fun to work there , free food on occasions, great staff and management, friendly environment, wages are little low as the job requires more work, great discounts and deals for employees."
good,"Everyone was always very positive, not as many career advancement opportunities as I would have liked. Definitely plenty of opportunities to learn for advancement through elearnings."
good,"Working at best buy is great only if u have a strong management team behind you. Ive been around long enough to see the good and bad times, but overall its good"
good,"The company cultivated diversity through employment, also they provided on the job training while you worked, maximized your benefits and ultimately fun place to be at, you meet new people including celebrities and models."
good,"Best Buy was a good experience overall for me. I learned quite a bit through their customer service training program. You will go through the typical retail experience however, which can be tiring."
good,Decent pay for a simple job. Tuition reimbursement. Bonus opportunities. Enticing employee discount program. Flexible full time scheduling sound college classes.
good,"I enjoyed working there in the mobile department. They do have an emphasis on customer relationships which is nice. It's a good place to get a good understanding of sales metrics. Make sure to have a plan to move up or on though. Don't get stuck in a certain place, not that it was terrible but it's always good to want more."
good,"It was an easy job to do. It slow most of the day but pickups when people start leaving work. That's when it gets busy or on holidays. My job was to deal with complaints from online shoppers, and assist them in correcting their orders."
good,"After working at Best Buy for almost two years, I grew to love the atmosphere of teamwork. The general manager's choice of hires and methods of team building made for a strong,  enjoyable workplace. Wages were low, but standard for a non-commission retail environment."
good,Fast pace and fun work space with much to do plethora of skills to gain working here. Benefits come into play almost immediately and you wouldn't think to go anywhere else.
good,Working at Best Buy is great your first few months there. Being able to meet new people and get them as excited about new tech as you are is always the best part of the job. After a while the charm wears off and it becomes a retail job that was great for advancing your skills but not something you would want to hold onto forever. Overall pretty good place to work.
good,"Best Buy management is well prepare and fun to work with. There's a great sense of friendship, yet is a serious place to work. The discount is good, but since is a retail business they operate during the Holidays and sometimes they don't really give employees a way to enjoy their time with their families. I believe that a company's greatest strength is the way they care about their employees and their families, not the mighty dollar of people that no longer enjoy the Holidays. Why these companies open on Thanksgiving and why on earth people will go there to shop, I don't understand this concept."
good,"A typical day at Best Buy would either be selling products or manning the register. I learned how to better sell products and credit cards or protection. The management is amazing, cares about employees, and are fun and laid back. The culture is honestly great, while they do prioritize sales, everyone is laid back and joking, there's no stuffiness and you'll be able to ask for help from others without worry. The hardest part of the job I would say is pulling off big sales and helping customers with products you don't know too well. The enjoyable part of the job was working with your team by far, get to know everyone and you'll have a good time while working."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work, the staff is proactive and friendly. The other employees are very sociable and open to help with whatever concern you have."
good,"Fun place to work at and no two days where the same. Things I learned where how to communicate with customers to their level of computer, printer understanding. Help them understand it in a way they would."
good,It is a fun place to work and most management is nice but they hire too many people so you hardly get any hours. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers but other than that it is pretty easy. A typical work day includes standing at a register ringing people out and answering their questions.
good,The work was tiring because it's a customer service job - people complain and come in with an attitude. But my coworkers were the best I've ever had and I would take the job again to work with them.
good,I do enjoy working at best buy. Sure the pay isn't that great but my co-workers are the best and they do not discriminate like past jobs I've had. I would recommend.
good,"One of the best retailers in Canada, good experience and perks. I have been recognized as the best supervisor twice and got the recognition of Achiever."
good,"Was fine, had some great personalities. The job itself was more or less redundant as I was mainly making whole home solutions for customers it sorta just started became dull."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy offers a great discount and just above minimum wage pay rate (over $10/hr). Various cliques form due to the age range of employees. Very limited upward mobility, a “favorites” game must be played with management. Overall a good place to start in your career."
good,"Working with a lot of people my age was nice. Opening and closing shifts were fairly easy, communication was effective, and I learned a lot everyday. Customers would be difficult sometimes, but when situations are out of your hands, you can always count on Managers to handle it from there. Would recommend this for people who enjoy being social not only with coworkers but especially with customers."
good,"It was quite awhile ago so I don't remember that much but I didn't have any negative experiences here. Everyone was nice and easy to get along with, management at the time was it great also, but I'm assuming my bow is probably completely new management."
good,"I love to work there my responsibilities were Sales, Purchase and handling all works including delivery and payment collection."
good,"A typical day at work includes receiving inventory items both physically and in the computer system, sorting product, stocking product on the sales floor and in the warehouse.  I learned that guest service is the most important aspect of any job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with co-workers."
good,"best buy is a fun place to work at. You are constantly learning new things whether its about a product, the job, or people you work with. you have regulars who come in on a daily to weekly basis and you have people who come in asking for directions. when i started i did not know much about technology so i figured what better place to learn. it definitely has helped me understand that sometimes you do get what you pay for with some products and other times it is as simple as a brand name."
good,Es una empresa que brinda mucho a poyo a su Staff.
good,Really enjoyed my time there and the experience that I received.  My co workers were very friendly and the job was fun and engaging.  Would definitely go back if I got a chance.
good,Best Buy was a great corporation to be employed at. Lots of areas to learn and grow in the products we had. Great teamwork and people who will help you as well.
good,"Excellent place to explore various career opportunities as well as personal growth opportunities. Great culture, relaxed environment, amazing amenities on campus."
good,"I had the best manager at best buy mobile (richard). He was a very understanding manager and he was fair.Which is hard to find now a days. Other than that, store culture was great with the exception of a couple managers that were always upset at life."
good,"A great company for full or part time work. You will really learn a lot about sales and your beginning sales career. A lot of great co workers, that help you grow."
good,"In my experience, everyone there had some form of love for tech, whether it be games or computer knowledge or even gadgets, there was always some form of love for tech. People with that passion are always ready to share if you want info."
good,"I love going to work and interacting with my co-workers, they make the days fly by. We are very supportive of each other and it's just like a family. It was great."
good,"El trabajo no es nada pesado pero en área de ventas por ejemplo las metas son muy altas y aunque no trabajes por comisión el recordatorio a cada momento es desgastante. El ambiente laboral con los compañeros es excelente, el liderazgo actualmente decayó de 3 años hacia la fecha. Muy buenas prestaciones pero el salario bajo. Empleo para jóvenes que estudian y solo necesitan dinero extra"
good,When you have a job that you enjoy it easy to want to go to work. Had awesome coworkers and a store manager.  Every one was a part of the team.  Even as Best buy was evolving for the better. Too bad they didn't renew their lease with mall otherwise I would still be there. Mall want to double rent since we were raking in the $$ . Principles before profits. We played games during work that sometimes involved customers and that caused them to continue to come back .
good,I enjoyed working with the technology. The management is great and fun to work with as long as you do the best you can at your job. i would highly recommend someone to work there
good,A good and mentally stimulating environment to work in that supplies its employees with the tools they need to not only succeed in their department but also advance if that's something you want to do.
good,When working at best buy there was always something to be done. Whether that be helping customers find their best solution or stocking the sales floor and making everything faced and looking in order.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"If you want to just coast they wont fire you, but you will never get raises. If you work hard and apply yourself you can get many raises and promotions."
good,Working with Best Buy the couple months i was there was productive and dun. The coworkers i had all knew business was first and made sure we all hit our goals for the day. At the end of the day we all knew our information on the technology we were selling and all helped each other out when needed.
good,For those needing flexible schedules for child care and what not. It is good. And at least in my store they have taken good care of every pregnant women very well. And provided private ( non bathroom) room for pumping if needed)
good,Good place to work overall. Hours are not great though and the revenue goals are difficult to attain when you are only getting 16 hours or less.  But it's still good overall.
good,I found the group of employees overall great and supportive. You learn a lot about different products while helping people. Good job advancement if you are a hard worker.
good,"I learned a lot about how to handle upset, worried, anxious and angry customers.  Geek Squad customers were all of that and more.  The team I worked with was meticulous about keeping track of people's computers/tv's/electronic equipment that was coming in."
good,It's retail don't expect anything other than technology. Meet great co-workers and customers.thwy keep you up to date and the company is cool...I hated new management that came in...I won't do names but the best manager was Ed!
good,My experience at Best Buy was phenomenal. Every day was a pleasure and I defiantly don't regret my time there. The other employees were always willing to help me when I started and defiantly miss working there.
good,"Loved my job, helping people solve their computer issues every day. Enjoyed the store and the people I worked with at the location I was at. I especially learned a lot of my current skills that I use today from my fellow Geek Squad Agents."
good,"I love my job at Geek Squad. I love the culture and the way I get to help people with issues they can't resolve.  I was considering becoming a lifer until I moved from Ithaca, NY to Slidell, LA and lost my full-time status. If they'd fix this I would stay to retirement."
good,Fast paced jobs that are always changing with the new technology. Wonderful benefits for full time and part time associates. Many different jobs within the company.
good,"Cool and fun management, but a very stressful and competitive workplace.  If you are working in Appliances, Magnolia, or Geek Squad there is very little room for error."
good,It was a good experience to work at Best Buy. Most of the co-workers were good and the managers were good as well. I would recommend any friend to work there.
good,"Fun company to work with, fun people. As always with retail, there are many young people involved (like I was) and therefore management may be a bit trigger-happy. Otherwise, the experience is just like any other retail company- sell stuff, make money, sell accessories, have fun."
good,"The oshkosh location was full of love, life, and laugher for each other. Everyday we would show up to work and give it our very best effort so that our store looked the best and our team looked the best. Things changed when management changed and the culture/dynamic of the store was killed off."
good,a typical day at work is conversing with guests and trying to up-sell while having a one on one convo. There are always challenges. you gain a lot of experience and skills
good,You must have a plan to work here. It's not so much an after school work environment. You have to focus on selling and be highly goal oiriented and self sufficent or you will be lost amongst the crowd. Technology is advancing to rapidly to be complacent here or unwilling to learn new prodiuct.
good,I worked here while going to school. They worked very well with my school schedule. It really was an awesome place to work. You will get out of the job what you put into it.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The culture at the store i worked at was great. It was baseball themed and the General Manager was always enthusiastic about working. I learned a lot of valuable skills there that allowed me to progress in my professional career.
good,"You receive calls all day. You get calls from other Best Buy facilities as well as techs and customers. Our job was to schedule repairs, add jobs into the techs schedules and answer to patients complaints as well as try our best to fix it. It was very repetitive and sometimes stressful job."
good,"We had a thriving team, our sales floor was always flowing. The computer department was so competitive and we fed off of each others energy and competed with the entire store on every metric possible!"
good,"Became good friend with my colleagues. 1101 was the best store that I worked for. They are very accommodating for students and military employees."
good,"I was fired because I annoyed some customers by pushing them too hard to buy extended warranties, but overall Best Buy was a good place to work. I learned from my mistakes in interacting with customers and I was always able to depend on my coworkers."
good,"Great starter job, would recommend to any highschool student or recent grads. Great work environment, usually good management. Decent compensation, but not a very good amount of advancement available"
good,I've worked at 2 locations of Best Buy and have liked them all in their own way. Though there is some issues that have recently occurred that I'm not thrilled about. They changed the bonus structure and now  its causing issues with my living conditions because we are not guaranteed any bonus whether or not we hit our revenue goal per month. It use to pay us out each month we hit our goal but now it takes an average of the entire quarter which means if you missed one month for rev it could severely affect the bonus or in our case recently not even get one this quarter. Which in my case really screws me over because they don't pay enough to live just on the hourly wages itself. Don't get me wrong the pay can start around 13 and gain up to $17/hr but its not enough unless you can get a bonus. Best Buy does not offer a christmas bonus of any kind so if we don't get one when we hit rev then we get nothing. I love this job with a passion but due to these changes I'm not looking elsewhere. If your in college and you have a passion in technology then join the team you will be glad you did. But if you are looking at a career or full-time employment look elsewhere.
good,I enjoyed working at Best Buy management was tolerable  and very helpful. Fun and friendly employees as well. Very job department oriented while still remaining team oriented.
good,Can be stressful but good environment and coworkers.  Good. Programs to help improve employee skills but rough start.  Can be a great job but corporate policies only pretend to favor the customers while really favoring the company.
good,Every day brings different challenges and it is rewarding to see people learn and change for the better. Management backs you up as long as you follow procedure which is great. Culture is great. Hardest part of the day is the challenging people you get to help.
good,"Everything you could imagine with working at Best Buy is wonderful honestly, The Leadership, Culture, Drive of my peers with the willingness to help and understand, the only thing that lacks is the amount of responsibility that is put onto a Geek Squad Agent for little pay and benefits, Going above and beyond is all what i'm about for a client experience, but I've been in to many instances where I feel like my work is no longer rewarding for the amount of effort and care that's put into it, so much to be expected off with little to show for in the end."
good,"From my personal experience, Best Buy cares more about its employees than most, especially in the retail world! Understanding and friendly co-workers make me more excited to go to work often. Easy to start and continue growing with the company."
good,"My direct boss was an awesome person who was super supportive and helpful with training and such, unfortunately most of the people above him were not. Store manager was great but I rarely got to interact with him and I was somewhat frustrated by the amount of time I spent cashiering rather than working the customer service desk. Employees felt like a solid team that looked out for each other and weren't afraid to have a bit of good clean fun."
good,My experience working at the two locations that I worked at were overall positive. I had great coworkers and I liked all my managers and supervisors. The only downside I felt was the pressure to preform well from the management with little to no benefit aside from some general appreciation and minor bonuses. As far as work advancement and promotions go there tended to be lack of opportunity to advance without changing locations and potentially relocating.
good,"It was fun and easy as a teenager. I had a great time balancing work and school at the same time. The pay was great and the hours were flexible. I really liked the atmosphere and the energy; however, at times it got really competitive."
good,"I started at Best Buy while in high school and went back while job searching after college. For most people, it isn't a career, but it is a good place to start getting some experience. Pay is better than most retail stores and discount is pretty good."
good,"Its a great place to work at, most of the people are great to work with. Peak time it's my style, fast paced life. Hours kinda sucked on off season but not to bad"
good,"Customers expect you to know about every single item in the store. Managers were very helpful when available but for the most part, you had to learn a lot of things on your own."
good,My experience at Best Buy was very enjoyable and fun to work at. Never have I had a stressful day there due to the fact of the great amazing colleagues surrounding me.
good,It was a great place to work. Learned a lot from my immediate supervisor. i learned alot more about cellphones too. Work hours were flexible as well too.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The coworkers are amazing, both people who work there and the customers who come in are nice. The job itself is fun if you like sales, but the management is terrible. A lot of drama in the management and the leadership is non existent, they take out their stress on the salesmen regardless of the cause."
good,At Best Buy your job as a salesman is to get as many services as possible and although it is not commissioned you could lose your job if you do not keep up well.
good,Generally fast paced. Always learning about new tech and problems with it. Good for building customer service experience. Good work atmosphere. Hard to move up in position at Geek Squad.
good,"Good job, decent pay. Work life balance is all over though."
good,"Best Buy also offers an amazing employee discount (just a small markup above the wholesale cost), a 401K plan with some company match for full-time employees, and, in some locations, tuition reimbursement. Benefits offered at Best Buy vary by location and job position."
good,"A great place to learn new technologies and develop sales/customer service skills, fast paced Durning the holidays servicing hundreds of customers daily."
good,"Great place to work, every store is different and this company absolutely cares about its employees. The management can be trusted and if you perform well you will have little to no issues moving up in the company."
good,"They need to figure out a way to separate GEEK Squad from best buy. Geek Squad should have normal 8-5 hours and operate like IT does for other companies. Overall though good experience for anyone looking to get into IT. A lot of phone calls, hardware and software repairs."
good,"TLDR: ""I've learned allot and enjoyed myself, however there is always room for improvement with Best Buy as a whole."""
good,"Working at Best Buy was an exciting job, every day there was always a new job for me to complete. Rotating from one department to another. The management was great in training me for different positions. The work culture was very peaceful as well, we were on schedule  in completing our assignments for day. The hardest part of the job would definitely be the cleaning up of the storage unit, there was always a heavy inventory there it required time and effort I. the storage unit. I enjoyed job restocking products on the floor, and interacting with the customers to help them find what they’re looking for."
good,Overall I enjoyed my time with the company. A lot of opportunity for self growth and you get out of it what you put in. If you're willing to take control of your own advancement then there are a lot of ways to move up.
good,"Best buy offers a good place for young to start in sales and other roles. The company is very employee oriented and though you do not make commission, you do receive bonuses as a team when goals are met and they do what they can to improve your skills and help you overcome objections. As a sales floor member you are well trained but they do look for personality traits like being friendly and easy to talk to which are important when dealing with customers. They want someone who will do what they can to help a customer while also trying to get the best total solution sale possible (ex. credit card, tech support, protection plan) which most of the time are a waste in most companies but with best buy do offer some good benefits. However managers are looking for this on every sale/most sales even though its not necessary in many situations."
good,"I would recommend this as a new workplace for almost anyone, they have great benefits and also want to promote from within. They have great pay as well for all jobs roles."
good,Overall it is a fun place to work with a lot of benefits. It is also kind of worth all the bs that you may have to go through with certain general managers. Some I've had will listen and cater to your issues. Others will disregard or say they'll handle whatever it is and not help at all until it becomes their problem.
good,"My day was usually started by reviewing our stock and making sure that everything that we needed for the day or week was either out on the floor or accessible. After that it was a matter of assisting any and all customers that would walk into my department and make sure that they had an enjoyable experience with us, and left the store happy. "
good,Retail is notorious for being grueling and sometimes boring. One of my favorite part of best by is everyone who applies pretty much has a vested  attachment to media or technology. It is easy to get along with managers and coworkers as you will find quickly that many of you share similar interests.
good,I went through several stores around northern Virginia and the best one I was at for three years. I built relationships that overlapped outside of work.
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work, if you have the right manager. Even when it is slow, there's still customers. Good management will push you in the right direction and help you improve whatever skills you choose to hone. Advancing in your own store is much easier than transferring stores, so it's a good idea to work at one of the larger stores, where there are more advancement opportunities."
good,"if you know your stuff you'll do well but it can be competitive at times"
good,I worked at Best buy for 7 months. Was overall a pretty good experience. The management team is very helpful in developing your skills as a sales rep. They hours are pretty good ranging to 5 hours on a typical part-time day to 8 hours on busier days. Not much growth opportunities as only way to move into senior positions is if the current one leaves.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,good place to work. My manager was great and very accommodating. I did well and I appreciated the opportunity. I worked here while obtaining my Bachelors from GA State.
good,"Good But loosely managed. I was able to advance to two different locations in store. Would Recommend as a Example of retail work to friends, family, and strangers."
good,Employees are great and fun to work with. Like many electronic retail stores there are lots of management changes and corporate changes. The company made lots of cuts and also lots of employee perks.
good,"Best Buy is a fun place to work and the discount is great. The quarterly bonus checks are also nice, if you are in a high volume store, like I was. Being in a high volume store, the days go by quickly. Management in my store was a bit lax, but other stores may be different. They encourage you to have fun while being the best. I just needed a change for being in retail for so long.I had fun with my coworkers, and was a great place to work, for retail."
good,working in this place is like going to tech school. best buy employee has to stay updated on latest technology. although stressful thing about the job is they track your numbers and tell you either to improve or they expect better which gets quite stressful at times
good,I loved working at BestBuy and would recommend it to college students. The hours were flexible and the environment was positive and not stressful. Management was supportive and interacting with customers along with employees was always a great experience.
good,Enjoyed cashiering would work here again there are still some employees that work there from when I was employed great product quality and team players would work there again
good,"Truthfully best retail store in my opinion. I have worked retail in clothing, food, and shoe companies, and Best Buy is a lot more beneficial as a company when it comes to experience."
good,"You get there and you see so many people in the store looking for help and I'm the kind of person who likes to help others. I learned how to push sales while making sure you don't sell something your client not looking for. I had opportunity to run my own team for 3 days, and I learned how to keep everyone motivated to be the best version of themselves. Workplace culture was really good, everyone always will to help if you need any. Hardest part of the job was waking up at 6 am every 3 months because of the companies meeting. I had a lot of fun learning new skills while having fun and best buy would organize activities after work hours which  was fun for example- Nerf war, barbecue etc and through you get to know your co-workers."
good,Had lots of great times here loved most people I worked with. great atmosphere as well as it teaches you a lot about technology with great incentives to work there. Best buy is a great company to work for.
good,It's entirely reliant on your management and what they can do for you to meet your needs. The work itself is pretty exciting if you like technology overall. I love coming in and working on units but this isn't always the case. Managers can force you to do what they want you to do and if you don't then your hours are always held against you if you're part-time. If you're looking for a basic job that gets your foot in technology but nothing more and don't need to sustain yourself on just this income this is for you.
good,"Overall best buy is a good place to work. The pay is reasonable, the workplace culture is good. Managers and supervisors do their best to help you in your time in the company. There is opportunity for advancement, but seniority trumps over who is best for the position."
good,My time at Best Buy were some of the most fun times of my life. While being a salesman can be high pressure at times (To hit ones numbers and such) it was never boring. Helping people to find what they needed felt rewarding. Playing with new technologies is also a huge benefit.
good,"I loved working at Best Buy in Chico.  The discounts were awesome, the management was awesome, and being around so many different people every day was awesome.  The downside is that the company has a serious cut throat attitude towards who gets full time vs. who doesn't.  If they like you, you get FT, if not, then enjoy your 20 hours a week.  It's literally high school all over again, the managers had their favorites (despite the company claiming otherwise) and as a result, funny popular workers got their full time hours, and everyone else got 10-25. Despite all of the overly-PC drama and the ""who's screwing who"" behind the redline, I would absolutely work there again, just maybe at a different store.  I love the company as a whole, just not the college town ""Chico vibe"" of my local one."
good,"Days at Best Buy were almost always active and filled with customer activity. During my time with Best Buy i learned the differences between tv/electronics, the proper way to have the complete HD Experience and what accessories are needed to properly connect an entertainment system."
good,"As an employee working at Best Buy for over a year, part-time for the entirety of my employment, full-time jobs would be the only reason to stay for more than a couple years. This job can be tough with trying to meet goals, working with difficult, frustrating, or ignorant customers, and the constant strive for excellence by management. As a part time, putting up with all of this with he only benefits being employee discount and, just recently added, 16 hours of Paid Time Off (PTO). Whereas Full Time, they get tuition reimbursement, more PTO, and other benefits. These help counter-balance the stress of the job. I can say though, most supervisors and management want you to succeed and do great and will work with individuals to do that. The culture from working there, but the stress from customers and corporate can be tough."
good,"The whole day consisted of picking products and taking it to the front, or package it for delivery. Except on Truck nights when the trucks had to be unloaded and the products had to be stocked. The most enjoyable part was probably putting on music when stocking the shelves on truck nights. However, the pay was not good for what we were doing in the warehouse."
good,Just very stagnant on advancement opportunities and compensation in mobile department sucks to me because that now days is the primary reason come into the stores now.
good,Job offered many benefits including 401k and tuition reimbursement as well as out of work team activities to help us become a Best Buy family. Awesome staff and decent pay rate.
good,Very good place to work for. the culture is really good and discounts are amazing. You fall in love with the work. The only thing we could have benefited more from was commission
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Great culture; the management team is hands-on and looks after its employees. They offer great benefits for full-time and part-time employees. There are opportunities to advance given your skill-set.
good,"Best Buy is one of the best sales job you will have. With all the new changes over the years from the new CEO, the company is focusing on new ways to not only support its customers but also its workers."
good,Every opening that was the motto we had to chant. High energy and happy faces were some of the things that I was greeted with most mornings. The management team did a great job motivating me to up sell PSPs and PRPs as often as I could. It was nice to be pushed in such a way and to be rewarded for doing so.
good,"It was such a great experience working at Best Buy. Yes, the discounts are great but in my opinion what's better is what makes the work environment: the people/ coworkers. The people I met while I was there were so fun, great, helpful, and relatable. I made many friends with both my coworkers and customers. "
good,Great place to work at if you love technology and selling what you love. the hours can get annoying sometimes but seems to be flexible as long as your flexible with them. if your not a fan of change then this might not be for you as the company tends to go through yearly changes.
good,They were flexible with my hours and my committment to school. The pay as well as the discounts were great as well! I really enjoyed the people that I worked with.
good,"Any given day we helped multiple people find a perfect product, learned about new products, built professional relationships with customers and coworkers."
good,I worked at Best Buy in September of last year and can definitely say it was one of my favorite jobs. Work environment was great and i always came in blessed and ready for whatever the day had to offer. Couldn’t stay longer because it was a seasonal term. Besides management being unresponsive at why i couldnt get an extension to part time it was a great job
good,Great team that meshed well together. When it was hectic we had a good flow of problem solving and helping each other with projects and assisting customers. When we had downtime we would play fun music and have challenges in different departments.
good,"BestBuy.com (Digital Division) has the best implementation of Agile I have seen. Even though each domain team has tweeked the framework to meet their team's needs, they still adhere to the basic tenets of Agile. The Digital Division is able to deliver an extraordinary amount of new features every week. Documentation and meetings are limited to what drives development forward. "
good,"Best Buy was great as a student, great full time and has flexible hours. They encourage a positive culture for everyone. I learned a lot working there."
good,Great company to get your foot in the door if you are looking to get into retail sales. The lessons I learned along the way helped build me into the sales career I currently have now.
good,"Its ok, little room to move up. A fun workplace. The best salesman wait for opportunity but mostly leave due to management overlooking most of us. Some still hold on just in case. Good discounts for products."
good,"Great place to work while you figure out what to do with your life. You are welcomed with great benefits, such as health plans, dental plans, 401K, etc."
good,"The job can be hectic. But for those who don't mind working hard and have an excellent work ethic, Best Buy is great and team work, which is key, is spot on for the fast paced nature of the business."
good,The job is amazing with the people that best buy has surrounded you with. The people they hire are friendly and typically have similar intrests with you.
good,Being able to work with many developing and new tech is amazing. With my coworkers making each shift fun alone with discovering new products in store made me love what I did there.
good,de las mejores empresas para trabajar por prestaciones pero deberia modificar el tratodirecto a los empleados
good,Mornings were stock counts and afternoons were solving problems for people. I learned how inventory control systems worked. Management was a little slow on implementing changes.
good,"Overall good place depending on management."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I like what the company stands for. I appreciate the training process. It’s a really good job if you can get a full-time position. As a seasonal employee I have not seen many pros and cons.
good,"Depending on the store and your team. Best Buy has a great potential to be an amazing environment to work in.Sometimes may not be the easiest job, but definitely rewarding."
good,"Hours vary from opening the store (10 am) or closing the store (9 pm)"
good,"Very flexible hours."
good,"I definitely enjoyed the actual job title of a sales associate at Best Buy, but I didn't feel like my management was setting up new associates for success. That's not to say that the entire store's management was bad, I just personally had a bad experience myself."
good,"I enjoyed it all with Best Buy great team and management it was my first job and helped me a lot with becoming who I am now, I wish I got a permanent full time l."
good,it all comes down to who the managers for the store are; each one has their own style and that determines how much enjoyment you'll get from working there.
good,"Great workplace culture because non-commission based."
good,"Was passed over on job advancements because of politics and management only wanting to keep close friends and family. These prizes for outstanding achievements were never given out. Overall, only work there for the discounts or holiday work. Leave when you can"
good,Best Buy is a great place to work.  I work in the Geek Squad department where we can encounter people from all walks of life.  I have learned many things about dealing with customers who are self centered as well as those that would categorize themselves as technologically challenged.  We strive to assist and teach our clients about their technology as well as fix the issues that they are creating/having with their technology.
good,"great atmosphere , meet a lot of great people . company treated you well for the most . managers are young and treat you fairly . No real complaints , would recommend to others ."
good,"Strong culture and genuinely care about people. Operating in a challenging environment, with strong headwinds."
good,Best Buy is a fun place to work at times. During the holidays is very fast and all the managers are cut throat as some may say. Management needs to listen to employees at times on what the store needs to do to be better instead of what they think needs to be changed.
good,"Stress on goals and numbers to hit for employees, many processes employees need to learn and understand to the tee in order to do their job correctly. Many perks for employees on site - full-service cafeteria and vending machines, microwaves, and refrigerators. Lockers, req room with tv's, gaming systems, ping pong tables, movies to watch, books to read, computers available, and a lactation room. Outside areas for smokers and non-smokers."
good,"Best Buy is a good place to work if you are in school. If you are going to school for computer science or something similar, you'll appreciate working with the latest and greatest tech"
good,It was exciting working for one of the top 10 eCommerce Web sites in the country and being a part of the massive restructuring which occurred while I was there.  I got the opportunity to work with many fun and talented individuals in  a very inclusive environment.
good,"I put myself through college with this job, it was a lot of fun and the benefits are great.  The pay could be better considering the level of work that some of the techs do."
good,"best buy being a retailer is decent company to work for. I have had really good experience with all aspects of that business. Young work force, supportive management etc.,"
good,"Team oriented, goal driven, and friendly. the culture feels like a family. Paper work is somewhat slow to get through but aside from the tolerable cons of working this place is a good place to work."
good,"I absolutely loved working for Best Buy.  I made a lot of significant changes to help the teams I worked for.  But After a workplace injury, it felt like they had more incentive to let me go than work with my limitations."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Productive and fun workplace. A typical day dealt with a lot of laughter and jokes, the energy was either very positive or very negative, but the managers made sure we ran a tight ship."
good,J'ai travaillé comme vendeur en boutique et c'est grace a cette emplois que j'ai appris a aimer le domaine des ventes.
good,"I was there for 2 year I liked it at first but over time I realized it wasn't for me. Management was ok, but very over welming. They harased every employee, even when you were doing things right. Overall I loved Best buy but every now and then management ruined the experience, I learned a lot and am still great full for working there."
good,"Good place with good people to work for, management is where you want to be if you plan on making any type of money. plenty of advancement opportunities for people looking to advance."
good,"Best Buy is a great company that helps you build skills that can apply to your every day life.  It's a fun working environment that is fast paced and keeps you productive while working with the latest and greatest in technology.  You learn how to build and/or strengthen soft skills, conflict resolution, customer service, and how to build rapport not only with customers but with peers as well."
good,Working with the Geek Squad team was a fantastic opportunity in my life. The team was amazing and we always had a blast at work. Fast paced and difficult consumer base to deal with occasionally however the culture made it all worth it. I would highly recommend as a stepping stone to move on to something better. There is limited benefits for part time employees and often no full time openings for advancement.
good,great place to work if your a college student looking for a flexible work schedule. overall management is tough but great and sharpening your customer and sales skills.
good,Best Buy sait réellement créer des environnements stimulants pour le développement et la culture d'entreprise est très forte. Ils offrent de bons avantages.
good,Overall Best Buy is a pretty fun place to work. Depending on the store management is how laid back or up tight the atmosphere will be. They are big on meeting goals for credit card apps and services which is understandable but sometimes management seems a little to pushy and makes employees feel like that have to coerce customers into getting them. The company does have good benefits if you can get a full time position though.
good,I enjoyed the friendships I made at Best Buy. The work load isn't too crazy and most of management is pretty understanding. The paid trainings are always really fun as well.
good,Best Buy was a great company at the beginning and the middle of my tenure there. When the new GM took over things began to go downhill. The overall moral of the store fell as well as productivity. The turnover rate grew as well. Overall I had an enjoyable experience. My direct supervisors/managers were great. They taught me a lot and made coming to work as good as it could be. Co-workers were also great to work with. The benefits and compensation are the best when it comes to retail.
good,great-friendly staff. had fun working there. liked management. best part of the job was working with clients. I always helped meet needs of client with best buys vast assortment of products. contests were fun too
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Best Buy in Guelph. The management is amazing and actually cares about it's staff."
good,"Working at this store was fun and the staff was great. Easy to open and close the store everyday. Management was great at taking and implementing feedback to the store."
good,It was a good place to work. Management was understanding and fair. Wage was fair as well. You are trained on the job with experienced people. You can only advance as far as you are willing to.
good,Best Buy is a company vested in your growth. You do have to be willing to work long hours. You need to be willing to move where ever the openings are which becomes difficult with a family.
good,"I am happy that Geek Squad is now an authorized repair shop for Apple.  In Apple's service Site, Best Buy's scheduling availability is listed equally to an Apple Store."
good,It was along time ago but it wasnt a bad job at the time . My coworkers were all team players and my manager was effective at his job and helped us when we needed it
good,"Great place to work, with a great team and management. The only downside to geek squad are the retail hours that go along with the job. Working all holidays and random hours that change weekly the only drawbacks."
good,"Best Buy was a great place to work with great people to work for. The company offers competitive pay with good benefits for its workers. I only worked for the company as a temporary hire during the holiday season of 2013/'14 before moving out of town, but if one opened up in my new town, I would absolutely seek employment there again."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Great way to learn how to market one's self towards customers as well as getting a chance to be knowledgeable on the products that you're trying to sell, Many workshop opportunities. Great competitive but fun team"
good,My coworkers were wonderful and so were the managers. I loved my time at best buy. The job isn't too stressful but still fast enough to be interesting.
good,the work place was a competitive environment in which we had to meet certain revenue goals. and we had access to a small brake room with a TV. overall it was a normal resale workplace
good,"Great place to work if you are a student that needs extra money for weekends or whatever.  As an adult with a life, or as a young adult, many people need a second ando/or third job to make ends meet."
good,"Great place to work with interesting, friendly employees. Management were had positive attitudes and are very vocal about your progress in the company."
good,Have nothing to post here because I wish to leave things on a positive note. Thank you for all the years and awesome memories. I wish that the truth was more important than personal pride.
good,"Great college job overall. Easy training and targets to hit, you always get coached, meetings are somewhat informative. It’s an okay entry level job at best."
good,"Orientation was clear and welcoming. Enjoyed meeting new people whether customers or co-workers, friendly environment. Great place to learn new things."
good,"Overall my complaints are mostly personal, such as always working holidays ect...."
good,"Overall can be a fun place to work, but if you cannot think quickly on your feet it is not probably for you. One skill to have is always being 3 steps ahead of the customer."
good,"Typically great coworkers and a friendly environment to work in. It can be stressful at times to hit goals, but for the most part, it is not a problem if you follow your training and can understand what the customer really needs and wants."
good,"Sometimes it can be very slow paced, but still be very active. hardest part about working there is when needing help with something, managers are not always at your beck and call. and does take a long time for them to respond to you. so some customers do get mad when they have to wait."
good,"I am currently a full-time college and student here in Houston, TX. I can say for certainty that BB is a great place for college students. P/T hours are great, pay is decent, but the discounts are awesome."
good,"Not just discounts on products, very cooperative & friendly culture. You work hard and you would be rewarded. Paid vacations, awards & other employees praise you. Even if your not in the race the managers and GM all call you by your name and motivate you to push through."
good,"The job itself was decent, you just talk to people, get to know them and recommend a product they need, but the downfall was how hard they stressed for more stuff. Like I get it, it's good to build the shopping cart, create more intimate interactions, but it's never enough. Like my numbers for the month is great and amazing but they always ask for more."
good,Best Buy has its ups and downs obviously just like any jobs. The ups were the discounts. Discounts were really good for some things.but somethings u had no discounts which sucked. The management never talked to each other. They all asked the same employee to do a different task and it was pretty confusing on who to listen to. Everyone got along in my department obviously not everyone gets along that’s expected in any job.hours were alright they get worse when there r more employees like for winter it sucks. the cons are When u leave the job even quit on good terms they WONT GIVE U A REFERENCE. I was there for 3.5 years and I like how could I get a reference somewhere else when I’ve been there for the past 3 years. Honestly wish I quit sooner because of that they screwed me over for a lot of other good opportunities but it’s there POLICY which sucks.  The wage is unfair. I was there for 3 years and was getting paid 13.09 and yet some new guy came along and gets paid 13$ an hour. Like what?!
good,"I have worked at two different Best Buy stores on opposite side of the country, and the one thing I can tell you is that the main thing that is going to impact your day is the culture of the sore. At my first store basically, everyone was friends with everyone, even if people weren't friends they would be cordial to one another. We all cared about our job too, we wanted to do well since we were happy and we liked it. And it showed we had good numbers all the time, yes at times things did get too relaxed and then management did step in to put some pressure. "
good,"Typical work day included mentoring staff, making sure we hit our daily target. Accountable for revenue, margin, budget across all channels including P&L. Supervise the work of sales consultants including training and development, coaching, mediating and follow up."
good,Best Buy was a good job at the time especially if you're picking yourself back up again. They work with you when you go to school and for other things but I personally feel that they could work better in their promoting procedures.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,productive and nice work workplace overall. good staff and worked good hours there. culture is good and friendly and the age group ranges. most enjoyable part of the job is the discounts on merchandise if the items being sold are in your interest.
good,Great Company.  An environment that allows individuals to bring their entire self to work daily.  Company that promotes from with in and pushes all levels of associates to be the best they can be.
good,Une entreprise qui prend a coeur la réussite de ses employés autant à l’intérieur de l’entreprise qu’à l’extérieur (il y a beaucoup d’étudiants)
good,"I’ve worked with Best Buy for one year and have held 3 different positions. The pay is rest for entry-level and management positions, the work is fun and rewarding, the goals set are challenging, the people are fun to be around. Whether or not you have the opportunity for promotions and advancement largely depends on tour immediate managers and supervisors, and the culture in relation to that is not consistent."
good,"Best Buy is a fantastic company to work for.  The benefits are good, the pay is fair and the Human Resource team is more than willing to assist employees.  Management is equitable and the equality policy is second to none.  I would HIGHLY recommend Best Buy as an employer."
good,"valuable team building exercises"
good,this is a great place to work if you are quick on your feet and love being challenged. It has awesome benefits compared to other companies so I would highly recommend.
good,"Working at Best Buy, was a fun and exciting experience. Learned a lot about the mobile industry and how the major phone companies work. Although there were some issues at certain periods of time based on staff count it was a rich experience"
good,Always something new to encounter at work. Co-workers willing to help and management worked with your schedule. Get ready to lose your weekends and holidays. IF working in a bigger Best Buy store it's hard to move up in career.
good,"the COMPANY is amazing in all ways, from its values, benefits, and the opportunities for advancement within the different sections of the COMPANY."
good,"It was great working at Best Buy and it is exciting to see how they have survived in this era of Amazon. "
good,Bestbuy is a lively place when customers are shopping but without customers it's dead. SMH this needs to be reviewed idk what else to say I left in 5 months for another better paying job.
good,great company. flexible schedules and great management. Always willing to work with employees to best benefit their schedule. Teaches management skills as well as customer relations
good,"good start for sales experience, no commission which sucks but benefits are fairly decent, definitely could pay more given how they don't pay commission."
good,Fast pace work environment. The staff is great.. associates work hard. Thankful  for the time and the opportunity to grow with this company. If you work hard you will see results.
good,"Was an extremely fun and happy place to work, learned a lot, extremely good general manager. Awesome company to work for, would highly recommend for a first job or for students"
good,I enjoyed what I was doing at best buy. I was selling smart home equipment to customers. I enjoyed working with my coworkers. the job consisted of a lot of walking and talking to customers to figure out what they needed or wanted.
good,Best Buy has been great for me and I will continue to develop into a great leader because of all the coachings we are given and learn from. I will always have a place for this company in my heart and mind.
good,"Best Buy is a leading provider of technology products, services and solutions. The company offers expert service at an unbeatable price more than 1.5 billion times a year to the consumers, small business owners and educators who visit our stores, engage with Geek Squad Agents or use BestBuy.com or the Best Buy app. The company has operations in the U.S. where more than 70 percent of the population lives within 15 minutes of a Best Buy store, as well as in Canada and Mexico, where Best Buy has a physical and online presence."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I like my coworker and we help each other to make our goal of the day. The manager are great they always try to make us better and move higher in the company.
good,A typical day is full of overcoming challenges both with customers and with the technology they bring in. Coworkers are extremely friendly and the atmosphere is typically very fun-going yet serious all at the same time.
good,"nice place to work if sales and retail is your thing"
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, mucho aprendizaje sobre nuevas tecnologías pero carga exhaustiva al abordamiento a clientes"
good,"Responsible for overseeing day-to-day operations of Geek Squad Precinct. Ensuring that all PCs are serviced correctly the first time while maintaining turnaround times. Analyze, plan, design, and install new PC systems and related hardware. Investigate/troubleshoot hardware problems. Hands on approach in diagnosing, repairing, maintaining and upgrading all PC hardware and equipment to ensure optimal workstation performance. While answering technical questions and providing any recommendations"
good,"Good place to work at. Love the atmosphere there, fun place to be at surrounding this tech world, discounts were awesome in their own BB brand. Pay was decent with the workload comparison"
good,"There was never any internal arguments between the staff, the management worked well to make sure team work played a large role in the workplace. it was a fun job"
good,"Geek Squad was a great place to start an IT career, but its time to move on to something more advanced/complicated than an Advanced repair Agent. "
good,"Needed more training for the job I was doing. Certain things never made clear. Everyone was wonderful to work with though. However, the pay and benefits just weren't enough for today's economy."
good,"Staff and culture were phenomenal. I cant speak on the behalf of other locations but and the store i worked at growth was encouraged and rewarded, you felt like you were part of a family not a work group. Pay was decent with holiday incentives and potential bonuses. You are rewarded for hard work."
good,Best buy was a very great experience. i was able to meet all kind of people and learn about all kinds of products. The management team do their best to make there employees comfortable.
good,Been working for Best Buy for a while now and I’ve met some amazing people. The teamwork and their attitude has made working for retail fun. As a company It is a great place to learn important working skills like customer service and rapport building.
good,"Of all of my college jobs, this was among my favorites. My managers were superb, my coworkers even better. They compensated my travel expenses for the Sales Induction course and made it easy to do so. If you're doing the work you were hired to do, you should have an excellent working relationship with the rest of your team, much like any job. I've seen people leave angrily because they were punished for not doing their job, so I feel like I have to note that, despite the fact that it seems obvious."
good,When I first started we had a real good team. Then the GM that hired me left. We tried to keep morale but it drifted. I was working a full time job on top of this. The new GM didn't want to work around my ft job anymore. They closed all Mobile SAS shortly after.
good,"Best buy was a great job for the first year for me, with a mature environment and great employees. The benefits were pretty good and they set you up in nice manor. The management was very friendly to me and always were pretty flexible with my schedule and out of work life. My only complaint i had was the culture was very competitive, but to the point were some employees were very judgmental, especially sales employees. I was a wear house employee, so i wasn't involved in the numbers and sales aspect of the store, but i took interest with taking time to help any customer in need, which helped me learn sales tactics on my own, just due to experience with customers. Advancement was very minimal, i only had one raise because i was with the company for a year and its was only 50 cents, and i felt like i was a hard working employee, but i never was demanding, because i kept to myself most of the time. The hardest part of the job was defiantly the inventory truck days, were all our new stock would come in, very physically demanding. The least enjoyable parts of the job were the days i struggled to find a task, which involved doing small tasks over an 8 hour period which would make the shift feel unproductive. Best defiantly matured me as a worker, as i grew with great employees over the year i was with them."
good,"Great job. Great people to work for. Management as a whole is greet, the culture is awesome but I wished for more compensation for the amount of time and effort put into the job."
good,"seasonal sales was cool, easy way to get a job at best buy and decent place to work. if you are trying to get and a stay permanently, do not get your hopes up. they tell you you can stay if you want but wont really keep you."
good,I worked in the ware house department so my day was a little different than the sells floor. I unloaded trucks and changed the price tags on the products to match the add
good,The culture is amazing. there are mostly young people here but I believe it helps bring discipline into them. The company teaches you a lot about work ethics and business so I'd say that you learn quite a bit here and there.
good,"It's alright. The discounts and my fellow employees are amazing, the best I've ever had working retail. But the management is not impressive. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy presented a fairly pleasant work environment. The management, at least in the store that I worked in were very adequate at their jobs, and were very capable of running a busy store."
good,"fun place to work, not gonna make a living, very sales oriented, be ready to be pressured to make sales everyday, every hour every minute. Great discounts"
good,"Best Buy was a great place to work. I was close with the other associates and I learned a ton about how to be successful in sales. On a daily basis we were pushed to achieve our goals and to maintain the business's values. The hardest part of the job was the constant push to do better, but of course this was always doable, especially over time when I learned how to be a better sales representative and to interact with customers."
good,This was a seasonal position. I packaged on-line orders to be shipped. Casual dress is allowed. I did not receive any information about benefits or advancement.
good,A typical day at Best Buy as a sales consultant is relaxed if you know how to sell enough to meet the revenue per hour goal. Failure to meet this at the end of the month means more structured training from your manager which can be brutal sometimes.
good,"Nothing too harsh, just gotta deal with dumb customers as usual at retail jobs. Supervisors at my store were pretty cool only one manager was a bit crankier then the others"
good,"My time a Best Buy was enjoyable. The work environment was relaxed and occasionally fast paced when the holidays would come around. I learned a lot about customer service, devices and sales. management is fair with little to no favoritism. hardest part of the job was the inconsistent hours and days worked."
good,"Great place to work, that actually tries to stick to its company values.  you will find like minded pears that share similar passion for technology and customer service."
good,I enjoyed working for Best Buy a great deal and have learned a lot from all my experiences there. The sales experience especially taught me how to be professional when working with clients and monitoring orders. I was able to succeed in my sales goals throughout my time selling appliances. I developed many great relationships with coworkers leading to exceptional performance within a team environment.
good,"Best Buy's greatest asset is that the digital revolution came after they established a consumer base. "
good,"Lots of opportunities to grow as a sales person, as well as many great resources available for those who wish to broaden their expertise regarding store products and services. My Best Buy team was always there to help me grow professionally and otherwise."
good,"Great place to work with a lot to keep you busy during shift hours. Great training and great coaching from managers and other employees. Also, a great job to have while you're a student. They work very well with your schedule."
good,Left the company to pursue other opportunity. The best thing about the job was the team. I had the pleasure to meet so many people that are still friends to this day. I would return if the right opportunity presented .
good,"Nice place to work when you're in need of something steady. Management has improved quite a bit with time. With the Surprise area, you'll need patience in order to deal with customers."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working for the company. It is an experience that will help you grow as a person, employee, and leader. If you are looking for a company to grow with- I would give them a chance."
good,Working at Best Buy overall was pretty good experience. The only downside is your experience really depends on your management team. The first store I worked at was amazing but my last store was hard to get through. Job security is iffy in my opinion since my first store closed.
good,Nice place to work. Great opportunity to learn the fundamentals of business and customer service. If you want to advance there aren't much in the way of limits. Meaning they don't worry too much about degrees they promote based on consistent results.
good,"Fun if you like teaching people about technology, also can fellow co-workers are knowledgeable and fun to work with. Would recommend working here for first job"
good,The management is not that great but overall the job is a lot of fun and totally worth working there plus the benefits on some products are awesome and great friendly fellow employees.
good,At bestbuy people are always encouraged to enjoy themselves and take every opportunity to improve themselves and advance within the company. Every one was made to feel welcome at all times
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"La visión y misión de la empresa son buenos, desafortunadamente en la sucursal que me encontraba, no siempre se aplicaban los valores ni los ideales de la empresa en cuestión de la relación Jefe/supervisor - empleado"
good,As long as your working hard you can move up. Probably the hardest part of the job is the customer. Just have to be patient. This job is really for someone who has good customer interaction.
good,"Best Buy can be a great place to work for.  There is lots of opportunity to move within the company and most of the management is willing to collaborate and help you succeed.  The job can be stressful at time with working with difficult customers and associates.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make a difference in people's lives.  Both with associates that I worked with and with customers that came in to shop.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the everyday stressors and having to cope with conflicting ideas on what should be done.  Working with management teams can sometimes feel like everyone is on the same page one day, and the next day you can feel like you are being singled out for taking initiative.  Overall, I enjoy working for Best Buy."
good,"Although I had a short time working there because I was hired on as a temp during the holiday season, It was a great place to work at. I would recommend to anyone that loves working in the tech field."
good,good job good starting pay but not a lot of hours or way to move forward unless someone leaves so not able to get full time and if part time they give less then 2- hours and no paid time off if part time.
good,"I loved working here and i was pretty bummed I had to leave for school but, they didn't pay me as much as i was getting at my other job which is why i chose to leave best buy."
good,"As a sales consultant at Best Buy, you are expected to meet your quote everyday with very little incentive. Your pay is not based on commission, but you will get a bonus at the end of the month if the WHOLE store reaches their sales target. Best Buy offers good training, and is ultimately a good part time job to start out with whether you're in high school or in college."
good,"Not paid enough for the required warehouse work . Staying late and unloading trucks isn't bad it is the way the team works. Some managers don't really care what time you leave. Not a bad job, Not awesome either..."
good,Very well balanced work and life scheduling and a great experience with coworkers. Everyone is very supportive and very motivated. If you're into technology you end up learning a lot here.
good,"Best Buy is a good company to work for. It is a great learning experience. It was my first job ever and I learned so much, from customer service to prioritizing my tasks."
good,Great work environment with the chance to move up if you stick to it. They give you lots of breaks with a 30 min lunch every 5+ hour shift. Very good.
good,"Training is long and arguably harder than the actual job. Difficulty depends on the day, Monday-Thursday is slow and, working during holidays sucks. The worst part of the job is getting people to sign up for credit cards. Even if the person is only getting a DvD or some batteries. Nevertheless I've learned a lot on technology and kept up to date with recent tech advances and was able to answer questions to customers not in my zone because of the information I've learned."
good,"Typical day for me at Best Buy was dealing with customer's and finding out EXACTLY what they needed, through asking the right questions. I was the guy who was going to get them that, and more."
good,Great overall experience. Managers treat you with respect and if you fall short of expectarions they will use polite encouragement to help you meet goals.
good,"A great place to improve salesmanship, however it had very limited hours of work. I enjoyed the numerous trainings that provided me with all the information I needed to sell products to customers. I was impressed by the relationships between the staff, it was very cordial and respectful.                                                                                                                                                                    ."
good,My days were answered behind the customer service desk and answering all questions on products and inventory. As well as answering all incoming calls. The people i worked with at my time at Best Buy were a lot of fun which made for a great work environment.
good,"If you need a part time summer job, best buy is good for that, full time benefits are also good. Holidays are a mess as they are at any retail place. Promotion is tricky and mostly dependent on your GM. If you want to make a career of best buy, higher-ups make good money but you have to put in a lot of time and as a result your work-life balance suffers quickly. Tenure means nothing to this company, it is all about metric based performance and customer surveys."
good,"I was always happy to go to work, my team made long boring work days where no one would come in to buy something better, they encouraged me leaving for school and reassured me that if I wanted to come back I would be welcomed."
good,A typical day at Best Buy would be helping customers with questions on any electronic as well as helping them find what they need. Keeping my section of the store cleaned and looking good. Finally patrolling around my designated department to prevent thieves. I learned how to read and understand people to give customers the best experience I can. I learned about all the new technologies coming out to be knowledgeable on the products we sold. The management was generally very nice and understanding. The hardest part of the job was learning the papers to help customers find items. the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help a customer out and seeing that i was able to make their day.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Long days but worth it was one of my first real jobs and it was a great experience. The people were easily my favorite part. I was able to experience multiple departments.
good,Great place to work. There is always something to do.  I enjoyed helping customers get what they needed.  The management team was very nice and accommodating.
good,"- friendly coworkers and management"
good,"A typical day in the appliance department is; Coming in and checking tags, email, elearnings, where im at in numbers, promotions and downstocking. After that i answer the phone and deal with the issues that customers have with their appliances and sell appliances to the customers in the store. "
good,Best Buy is a great place to work especially if you love technology. You get your hands on all the new stuff as soon as it is released and Best Buy trains you on everything before it hits the shelves. It's fun to help customers create the experiences they are seeking to have through technology.
good,"It is a nice place to work. Everyone is very friendly and easy-going."
good,"Generally 3 submitted customer escalations from stores via Sharepoint. SoP was to contact within 1 hour to establish single point of contact, then 4 hours to come up with a workable resolution for the customers issues. Once that resolution becomes a coordinated effort between depts. we contact the customer the day after to confirm the issue has been resolved, then discuss if my solution was effective enough for the customer to continue to shop with Best Buy."
good,See above I just want to find another job why are you asking about a job I had three years ago this is pointless and keeping me from looking in to jobs that actually suit me
good,"Flexible hours and little pressure to make sales. Positive work environment made it easy to complete tasks. Morale was high."
good,"Best Buy fue un gran lugar para trabajar, todos los días demostrabamos los valores de la empresa."
good,"Overall I enjoyed working at this store. Manager is business-oriented yet understands that the employee experience is a high priority. Most management staff were good to work with and easy to relate to. Despite turnover, co-workers were great to work with and made the experience much more enjoyable."
good,"I only worked part-time as a high school student, so I worked around 4-6 hours after school on some weekdays. Great culture, great people, and great management. However, you had to meet a lot of sales goals. Overall, I really enjoyed my two years at Best Buy."
good,"I learnt the art of dealing with customers, cooperating with colleagues and learning more and more every day. Also, our attitude toward the job and the people around also plays a very important role."
good,"Helping customers on the daily basis was a great experience at Best Buy. I'd excelled and executed daily sales, to make sure my store was at the top in the region."
good,Best Buy is a great place to work for but depending on the management you have sometimes favorites come into play with scheduling. Discounts are great and it is a very well run business.
good,I really enjoy working here as a part time job. They are flexible & understanding & i really enjoy coming to work. I started here when the economy was slow & this was my only income. They were very understanding when i got a full time job & had to change my availability & reduce my hours.
good,"Best buy is a productive and fun place to work. I love the people there and the culture but theres no room for advancement, by that I mean internal hiring is almost non-existent, at least at my store it isn't . Otherwise if your a college student or highschool student who loves technology its a good place to work."
good,Did not agree with the reason I was releases especially after recieving tech of the year for 2011 and was number 1 in my disctrict for what i did and 2nd nationwide
good,Work with staff to provide great services to our clients to ensure they can get through their discomfort with technology and walk away happy and keep them coming back
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,why would you make a review mandatory? I just gotta meet the minimum so i'll keep typing. This is ridiculous. Wow. Good job though. Most people were great.
good,"easy to start, flexible hours, get what you put into it, the main factor with this and any job is the people around you, never had a problem that couldn't be fixed by talking about it."
good,"It wasn't too bad working here regardless of it being a contract job, it was something i definitely could see myself doing again. The three months that i did work there had many different weather conditions."
good,"One potential flaw in the Geek Squad Agent onboarding process is that the ""training program"" is more a series of checkboxes. The work itself can be at times very intense, or a bit boring, depending on the flow of clients at any particular time, and the fluctuation between those extremes can also be severe."
good,I have have enjoyed this company for years and became somewhat of a face for it.. i have gone through many different position changes an seen the company change and grow.
good,"You typically start the day in your department, using your guided sales sheets along with customer interaction to help them find the right product that fits their needs. Not only do you learn about nearly every product available, but you learn about each customer in unique ways to better reach their ""Complete Package"" sale."
good,Always fun and exciting. Wild love to work here again. Discount is awesome! Managers can be hit or miss. I really liked it though. I just didn't like the late hours and weekends.
good,"During my employment at Best Buy Mobile, I was given a ton of opportunities to advance my career. As an employee, we were required to take electronic learning classes. They ranged in time but could be done in as little as 10 minutes or as much as 2 hours. The quizzes were sometimes challenging but, overall, worth the knowledge for the field. Management was always supportive of me and saw my goals as their goals as well."
good,"Best buy is definitely a great place to work, the pay is more than fair for the job, but the career advancement is very slow. Be prepared to sell credit cards more than anything else."
good,The people at the organization were of high integrity. The employees felt that putting other employees down would increase the likelihood of their advancement.
good,"You can feel the energy here."
good,The management was always welcoming and fourthcoming. always felxabible with schedlce. most days at work were very busy but the team was always willing to help each toher when needed. the hardest part of the job was learning all the new features of the new technology coming out.
good,Minimum stress and fun place to work.Hardest part of the job is customer flow. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the employees and seeing the diversity.
good,"Working as a Sales Consultant at Best Buy was a good experience as a job, and an excellent opportunity for improving communication skills.  The training was readily provided to improve my ability to sell products, but it also taught valuable communication skills to help in this and future jobs.  These skills are not only important for selling products but also selling your own abilities in interviews in the future."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work, however, as a college student trying to work and pay the bills, it was very difficult to get the amount of hours I needed there.  I thoroughly enjoy the sales and customer service aspect of the job, and always knowing the new technology, but I left for basic training and made the decision to not return because I knew they couldn't offer the hours I needed."
good,"If you allow yourself to become a floater (ie, shifting between departments as needed) management becomes reluctant to give you a position in your desired department, even if it would mean a pay raise. This was my experience."
good,"working at best buy is fun they have a good management and they respect all their member, getting a discount for buying electronics thing from them is such abig help for me."
good,"Good stepping stool for customer service and sales experience. Great job culture and good reputation company. It has annoying moments like any job, but great company in general."
good,Loved this career it was fun working with many celebrities in Hollywood and in the music business. Great team building and having to work in changing atmosphere I loved learning how the shows and concerts work and how record labels treat the artist very good culture of different genres of music. Represented the whole entire label of Made it Happen Ent.
good,"Its a great job to have during and, right out of college. In my instance, It was a great place to work while I took the time to get myself into a position to look for a job in my field of study and find a place to live. A typical day of work was what you made it. If you came in with a bad attitude your day wasn't great and you brought others down slowing down their work pace and flow. If you came in with a good mood then your day went by quick and you were kept busy. Management was a bit fickle but sometimes it has to be. Hardest part of the job is training others as there is so much to teach and always more to learn. The most enjoyable part is building a network of people that you see every day become your friends and family."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"It is a good part time job. As in any retail environment, you have figure out exactly what is desired of you, and do it to your best. "
good,"What I learned from working at Best Buy is that there is way more technology than I expected and how much the present has become the future. I did like working here however I didn't get enough hours. the people at best buy are amazing people to work with, fun, outgoing, and are open-minded to culture and diversity. I'd recommend friends and family and anyone who is looking for work to work there. The managers care about their employees and make sure their needs are met."
good,"I would get to work at 9 and work until 5. The days were very simple i made sure to exemplify good customer service and have fun with my colleagues in the process. Being a good salesman to me was being approachable, knowledgeable, professional and most of all fun."
good,"En tant que commis, je devais placer et remplir les produits à leur place. Je devais faire le prix. Il n'y avait rien de difficile, c'était un travail saisonnier."
good,"Great people, management is employee friendly, work is not overwhelming. Nice overtime during holidays. Great medical benefits. Best Buy discount is good, very low price for extended service plans"
good,"Typical day was slow and not too bad."
good,"I've worked here for 5 and a half years and have learned so much about technology and how to become a leader. I've had some great leaders and worked with some wonderful people. I've been able to move up and learn even more. If you are serious about a career in retail, Best Buy is certainly a place to consider."
good,"I have Enjoyed working for Best Buy in Dallas. The Geek Squad home install team has been good. The hours are reasonable, and there is often some overtime."
good,"A key part of their culture was ""Having fun while being the best."" And it really did feel like they meant it. Having worked at 2 different locations, the key component is the GM and how they choose to interpret that. My only real complaint was the corporate mandated pushing of add-ons and credit cards. The pressure was taken to a degree that made previously meaningful interactions with customers feel disingenuous."
good,"only bad thing is, a few times while working at BEST BUY, you have people that try to step on your toes just to make a sale like we are get some form of commission and a lot of times they try and bully their way into your sale so they can get credit by just standing there. TO AVOID PROBLEMS Like these..... SPEAK UP!!!!!!  DONT LET THEM AND THEY WILL GET IT."
good,"While this job can be a bit stressful during holiday times and specifically monetized holidays, the overall joy of the job comes from knowing that you can help someone integrate their home into the next wave of technology."
good,"Plenty of nice, fun coworkers that were helpful and enjoyable to be around. Retail hours are hard to get used to since there is no set schedule and your schedule changes from week to week."
good,"-Sold"
good,Great challenging opportunity to advance in multiple areas of both soft and hard skill sets. My day was in driving changes into the business model with management's approval we accomplished such tasks and the business daily became the success of tomorrow. Culture a bit of a change - but healthy. Communication was great in that we all felt heard and communicated to. Hardest part was being held back from being successful because of micromanagement practices. Best part was the Willingness of the CIO to share her transparency of where she thought the business was going and what we all needed to do to help the business get there.
good,"This job has helped me to become a self starter; Although, I have not been at this job long it has taught me to get my work done efficiently. The most enjoyable part is that I work with stand up men that have extended proper guidance to perform at a high level."
good,"Working at Best Buy was a great experience for me. It taught me to organize, consolidate, and plan accordingly to given situations. Some skills I even carried with me to future jobs."
good,"Best Buys is a great place to work which does not pay based on commission.  Management is great and so are the employees, but there are sometimes issues getting good hours."
good,"The job itself is pretty standard, but in a good way. Help customers out, figure out solutions, get help from coworkers. I don't get a ""clique"" feeling from anybody in my store, so anybody and everybody is approachable."
good,"Although the actual job could be a bit monotonous there was definitely plenty of situations that could challenge individuals of every skill level.  Time management, ability to diagnose/troubleshoot, how quickly problems could be remedied etc.  Great benefits too!"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"This is a good part-time job to pick up some extra income. The discount is amazing. You are dealing with customers all day, so if you don't like people, this is not the job for you. Otherwise, it is fine."
good,"Challenging and engaging work, with many things needing to be done, but lacking in any sort of managerial communication. Often times, I had to go to three different managers to get the right answer."
good,Its a fun place to work at. Management is always there to help you out. If you need more hours to work they can provide it also if youre going to school theyre more likely to help you out.
good,Great company.  Training is impeccable.  Management is well versed and communication skills are well above normal.  Enjoyed the freedom of the job and awards.
good,"Good benefits and good people to work with just not enough pay and too many stressful hours for not enough pay, but it was the second best job I had next to Apple. Way better than working anywhere else I worked like call centers and food places. They just need to pay a little more but it was a fun and good job. Also they need to be better with advancement. They would rather bring people from other stores to manager positions instead of moving up their own. You have to transfer stores to move up which makes no sense. Unless that's just how they do in California."
good,"Es una buena empresa, dan mucha accesibilidad con horarios a los estudiantes pero lo unico malo es que pagan por hora y no es mucho para mantenerte economicamente estable."
good,"Work life balance is hard to maintain when working in a high volume retail environment, however under a good management team this is an easy environment to thrive in. Working with bestbuy for 5 years, the company has had its fair share of ups and downs both locally to a store, and globally as a company. During all the changes the teams of people you work with feel more like family, rather than just associates. But a lot of the stresses this field imposes require a strong safety net, so working in a store with poor management will offer a poor experience."
good,"Best Buy is still retail, at the end of the day. It's still a headache. It's not the best job in the world. It certainly hasn't been my dream job. But it's a job. And to be honest, the payoff isn't bad at all."
good,"The job teaches employees how to deal with long hours and difficult costumers. The work environment is geared towards great customer experience.  Management at the Knightdale store is all about 'one team, one dream'"
good,"Working with the inventory team was a great stepping stone in learning team building, hard work, paired with fast paced pressuring work. Advancements are given to those who prove their dedication. Unfortunately, some leads and supervisors don't notice their best talent, however there is space to make lateral moves to continue escalating up the chain if you aren't satisfied with your current position."
good,The environment is nice but can be dull at times. When it's busy time can fly by and it can be lots of fun. It was easy to talk to the managers whenever you had a question or there was an issue.
good,"great, fun work environment (if you like retail)"
good,"Sometimes management made your job hard because everywhere you work wants to make more money but it would also be the customers that made your job hard, Sometimes you would get cursed out or humilated because all you did was do your job and follow the policy your supposed to follow"
good,"I would go to work, login to the phones and wait for a call, once a call was received I would assist the customer as best I can and if I couldn't do anything else I would then transfer them to the correct phone line."
good,The job is great. Its great to great to get your feet wet in all sorts of areas. Always a way to move up and move around departments. only thing is the way in which management act around employees.
good,"I feel that the training process involved at Best Buy was wonderful. I learned about all of the processes, from sales to warehouse procedures, and was continuously updated on policy changes. The people I worked with were fun and knowledgeable and built each other up. While it was at times difficult to reach goals set during the holidays since we were so busy, I greatly enjoyed the fast-paced environment and constant level of work."
good,"In mobile, days were either incredibly slow or super busy. Individual transactions generally took about 30 minutes to complete, but certain issues could make them take hours. I definitely learned patience and how to better manage customers during times of extreme problems. The workplace itself, though, is generally accepting and fair. Managers were all incredible and seemed to truly care about their employees. But this could be unique to my particular store. Only major gripe was the pay. There is no commission (however there are monthly bonuses dependent on store performance) which makes the pay for my particular department seem rather low. However, for the rest of the departments the pay is incredibly fair."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I learned a lot about computers and was able to build my confidence with speaking to people. There would always be a meeting before the store opened to plan what the target goal were for the day. We would play games and had competition to see who would get the most sales. I really loved the people I worked with. Management was very understanding and caring.
good,"Fine place to work just not enough money.Stressful during the holidays but it’s retail what do you expect.Management will staff poorly and expect 1 person to pick up the slack of multiple.Good people to work with and for,just not always the greatest planning."
good,"A work day typically is either very fast or very slow. I have learned about faxing, filing, and a couple other things. Management is great. Everyone is very nice and behaved. I think the hardest part of the job is making sure everything gets done on a busy day or trying to stay busy when it is really slow. The most enjoyable part of my job has to be coworkers. They are so amazing and nice. Everyone just gets along and its very enjoyable."
good,"Great discounts, average retail job. Management was very positive and accepting. Relaxed team-based environment. It was competitive in the sales department though which could be discouraging at times, especially for newer employees."
good,Es un ambiente de trabajo relajado y divertido sobre todo por el perfil de los trabajadores que en su mayoria son estudiantes que trabajan medio tiempo y se preocupan por el empleado
good,"loved working for this company, it was fast paced, you felt like you were helping people future proof they're lives, if you got into geek squad that's where things got really fun, fixing computers and tvs was always interesting to me"
good,"There were a lot of ups and downs, particularly with management, but overall I had a good experience. Lot of moments of complacency that would always be brought up by either other coworkers or management. The pay was decent for the job required, but sometimes they would require more from you with little to no compensation. Work hours were very fair, and my particular supervisor was very flexible. If you worked hard and showed you wanted to work, you were favored and given more hours (This only goes for the part-timers.) The work place was very relaxed for the most part."
good,was seasonal but i enjoyed working there fast paced and gotta know your stuff but also a lot of ways to learn more i wanted to stay on but they kept another person
good,Best Buy is a great place to work if you need a resume booster and increase in communication skills. Management always has your back and is there to help you improve in whatever you do especially as a person.
good,I learned a lot of useful stuff and got to get some good sales experience. I liked the managers and I liked my co workers. I would have stayed longer if it wasn't for school
good,I learned a lot working here and enjoyed the environment and management. Best buy puts a lot into training and I became confident in sales and customer service in this position.
good,Geek Squad is a Productive workplace that helped increase my multi tasking skills! The staff were very respectful and helpful. Management was great with providing opportunities to receive bonuses!
good,"Played games related to sales, rewarded constantly for good performances, good benefit package including 401(k) and stock options. Management was very helpful and encouraging, always willing and available to talk about anything. The culture was that of having fun and encouraging each other while treating customers with respect. The most difficult part of the job was not being able to satisfy every customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendships that I developed while working there."
good,Best Buy is an amazing job for those new to a work force.  They establish good habits in their training and inspire employees to care for their work.  Each day brings something new to the table whether it is a new customer experience or new technology for the public.
good,There was one thing that I really appreciated about Best Buy and that was the culture of developing people. They do this well and I enjoyed the learning experiences that I was fortunate enough to be a part of there.
good,"It's an ok job, I didn't get many hours even though I got hired around the holiday season. I didnt even get trained, i learned the ins and outs on my own and will probably never work for this company again"
good,"Very fast paced and competitive environment. Management is relaxed, but pay is not great for the workload. You will learn great communication and time management skills. Also, the company is great at working around your schedule."
good,This Job taught me how to be a manager and how to get respect and be authoritative. It was a good starter job. I left it to move on to a better and higher up position.
good,"Was my first time doing any work in retail and as a sales floor consultant, and as a seasonal worker. "
good,Prepare for the daily task routine everyday. Then you communicate with your team on what task you will be completing that day. Productive and fun workplace. Competitive on the Sales floor and a slow pace at times. Benefits are excellent. The Management needs to improve on holding people accountable for their daily task work. Love working with the Merchandising team because there is always something to do time flies. Hardest part of Merchandising is setting up large and heavy displays and finishing Ad set in a timely manner.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Not a bad place to work if you're only seeking part time. There isn't much room for advancement and pay increases only come with a promotion. Usually works with school schedules so thats a plus.
good,"Working for Geek Squad is an interesting experience in that there is no typical work day.  You can have days that range from driving all day to sitting at one house for almost the entire day.  One of the nice things about working in this capacity is that you are constantly encouraged to learn and to educate others around you on technology.  Management differs from person to person and market to market but where I am located management is very understanding and is willing to work with somebody to ensure that you are enjoying your career and your personal life.  One of the hardest things about the job is the end result, teaching others how to use technology to unlock their potential as many of the clients that we have are not tech-savvy people and are often afraid of making a mistake.  However, this leads to one of the most rewarding parts of the job and that is watching somebody conquer their fears of technology and start to use it to make their life more enjoyable."
good,"Great co-workers and a fun place to learn a lot about the ever changing technology. Great entry level to sales, that introduces great selling techniques to its employees"
good,"My overall review is simply this. Geek Squad has a great work culture and goal in mind. If you like assisting people with their tech needs, this is a good job for you.  My only problem was some bad leaders at one point in time. It also sucked that my job was basically outsourced."
good,"working at best buy was an excellent job, with fun and friendly supervisors and employess. The breaks were good with lots of time for lunch as well. I enjoyed working in a team oriented workplace with lots of possibilities for advancement and bonuses"
good,All you really need to do for this job is make as many seals as you can. This is what determines if you keep your job assuming you're going to be a regular.
good,Overall this is a good company to work for. They have great benefits and discounts across the board not just at the store. Pay is decent and flexible hours. ability to relocate anywhere in the company but hard to advance.
good,"Best Buy is actually not horrible to work for, given that its still in retail. There is good training available, plenty of advancement opportunities, and plenty of ways to make far more than your normal wage. Only left due to parental obligations and an unstable situation for my young son. Would not mind going back to work for them should I choose to go back into retail."
good,"cons: hard labor where I worked, which was the shipping department. stressful when people would call in because you had more work and management was always concerned about budget so you always felt rushed. pros: good pay and some good benefits."
good,Had a great experience working for a fabulous company. Great for those who are in Higher Learning trying to balance out school + work.  put in the numbers who get recognized and pay increase.
good,"Being in the back warehouse was a great experience. I met a lot of people and got used to the work environment very quickly. When not working truck days, you are generally unsupervised so you need to keep busy to show the managers that you deserve more hours. My manager was great and did not hesitate to let me know when I made a mistake, but he did it in a way that was relateable."
good,"Retail jobs are known to be brutal, but Best Buy was a good  place to be. Benefits are great and they work around personal schedules. There are many different varieties of employment within the large retail organization. Sales oriented or service oriented, or both! Great variety of job types within."
good,"Overall this job has been one of my favorite jobs to date, I was able to obtain new knowledge of electronic products as well as work with some of the kindest co workers who were willing to share the knowledge they already possessed."
good,"I loved working there, had to leave due to my full-time job's non-competitive clause change. Relaxed pace, duties change constantly, never get bored. always something to do."
good,overall best buy was a cool environment. pay was good hours were good I just needed advancement in my career and life and they just couldn't meet that
good,Everyone knows Best Buy.. it was a great place to work for 12 years.. I was paid well and received plenty of great benefits including an employee discount which of course was my favorite.. butted heads with management on occasion but for the most part we were able to see eye to eye after a discussion.. I would recommend working for this company
good,a job is a job its just your always on your feet i want a nice relaxed job and if thats what you want dont go looking there. very fast paced and you cannot have a set schedule
good,the managers work closely with employees to help benefit their sales technique and to encourage them to always strive for more. fellow coworkers are super friendly!
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"very stress free, as long as the sales manager has no problem dealing with bunch of college kids who does not care if they lose their jobs. The place lacks career advancement, however, you can apply internal job search if you'd like. "
good,"I loved working at Best Buy!  The management was fair and friendly. Sometimes the work was heavy, which was probably the worse part of my job.  All departments were fast paced but everyone worked together and helped each other out. I met so many people and made alot of friends,  which i would say was the best part of my job. I wish they were still here because I definitely would go back."
good,Hard work and goals set to finish the day and meet store requirements. Job was about as what was expected. Management listened and we were given flexible schedules.
good,Moving up feels pretty impossible if you're good at your position. The management can be great but the mood of the store depends on them. Coworkers are al great and the discounts are phenomenal! Can be a great career if you just need a consistent 40 hours a week.
good,Good place to work for college students and young teens or a 2nd or part time job unless you are looking into moving up to management level. lacks good work life balance as all retail normally does.
good,"the job really depends on your manager, it can be fun or it can be miserable... really depends on the days. as far the people you encounter most are really nice."
good,"nice place to work, clean, customers werent rude, easy system and quick to learn, no problems from staff. no extra madness or stress. would recommend others"
good,"A typical day consists of working closely with customers to find appropriate solutions for computer issues. Most significantly, working in accordance with Geek Squad and Best Buys own targets, in which the customer becomes a Geek Squad home member, allowing us to fix software issues free of charge. Further tasks consist of using Geek Squad specific software to setup customers computers. Furthermore, one large aspect of the job consists of shipping units with hardware issues to other Geek Squad locations. This requires knowledge surrounding how to use company specific database tools and 3rd party shipping companies such as UPS."
good,I have currently been at Best Buy for four years now. I was there while I was going to school for my degree. I love the people that I work with and I haven't had an issue with anyone.
good,"If you are a peppy individual who can get his/her butt out of bed and start the day with a smile, this is a great job. Quick-paced. No lazying about. Training is offered all the time and the tangible rewards for doing so can be spectacular (once I got 60% off of a Hue lights starter kit!). Go ahead and apply, but be forewarned, it can get draining walking around all day on your feet talking to customers. Keep a good attitude."
good,Management was very helpful with working with everybody's needs. E-learnings were very helpful to keep up with the constant changing and upgrading of technology. Hardest part of the job is black friday and customers who refuse to listen to experts advice. The best part of the job was the team work and comradely of the employees. It is very hard and takes a while to advance to full time.
good,Sales are awarded bonus pay if store meets high expectations. You have task as per department to meet daily. Would recommend but must be able to talk to people
good,"Good training and coaching techniques. Opportunities  to grow  Great for a summer job If you make good relationship with management, your life can be easy. Highly focused on sales and targets. High quality merchandising needs and very customer focused business"
good,"Great Place to work, Very Competitive, If you like talking to customers learning about electronics and sharing your knowledge with others, its for you"
good,I grew up in the best buy culture and learned so much during my 8 years there. I had great managers and plenty of opportunities to learn and advance my career.
good,"I was with Best Buy throughout 3/4 of my college career. They were a great stepping stone to give me opportunity in other aspects. If you take the job seriously, and go in trying your best every day, in the very least, you will gain some great knowledge in technology and the tech industry as a whole. You meet different people with different lifestyles every day, and you have the opportunity to really get to know them, and learn about them to sell them what will fit their needs."
good,Great job for high school and college students. Very fast paced when truck loads come in but when they dont it can get very slow at times and you need to find work to do
good,"I worked at Best Buy at two different stores in two different states and while the job is fun, competitive, and friendly, advancement is slow. You have to wait for someone to leave to advance (which took years at one store and months at another) and they try to hire from within first which makes it slow to fill. While they are fair in hiring there is a huge lack of communication on when and how to advance."
good,"Despite the finite time, and large workload, members worked efficiently to ensure customers would gain the be best treatment possible. The large work was done efficiently due to the well received constructive criticism done by other departments as well as workers being open to new and different ideas."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Geek Squad is a great place to start your Information Technology Support career. Highly regarded throughout the Support field, Geek Squad teaches you many of the fundamentals required in a client based support role."
good,i enjoyed the job because you got to interact with people and sell them thing that that would fall in love with. things i learned was how to show people things they didn't know they needed.
good,I love Best Buy. This company taught me everything that I know about modern business and is the biggest reason why I pursued a Master's Degree in Business. The knowledge that I gained from working at Best Buy outweighs any monetary reimbursement that I earned from working at this great company.
good,Overall best buy is a good experience that anyone with little to no work experience would enjoy. Decent pay to start and face paced with lots of learning and decent discount.
good,lots of people with different cultures and backgrounds. hands on experience with customers and merchandise. you get discounts on the great merchandise
good,"Was an awesome job until we were all let go. We were given a ton of benefits and discounts. It was a fun, face paced work environment and there was always someone there to help you find any answers you may not have."
good,"Time sensitive job and sometimes can be challenging to complete work in a particular time frame on a busy day.  I enjoy working there,  good team of coworkers which makes going to work enjoyable."
good,Overall it was a good team working environment it was fun and I learned a lot about sales and how we sale to customers. You get to learn all the perks of working as a BestBuy employee you get a great discount with them as well and always opportunity to moving up in the chain.
good,"Its pretty relaxing most days, just customers asking the same questions. Then on weekends it gets busier where you're pretty much just going back and forth to get products for customers from the back (warehouse). Not based on commission but theu try to get you to sell premium products and not the basics. Not that competitive unless you really see yourself there for a few years. Prety fun, great people, not a lot of pressure on you to sell (unless you're part-time)."
good,"Buen lugar de trabajo para primeros empleos, oportunidad de crecimiento nula."
good,"Let's be real, this is a retail job with moderate room for advancement into management. Pay and compensation are a little on the upper side for retail work but don't expect to make a career here."
good,"Good job, some employees are lazy and need to work harder. Great place when you have a great boss. Loved the money around Christmas with working long hrs"
good,Working for Best Buy Mobile as a first job in the technology industry was great for me. I learned about being competitive while still being on the same team. Also I learned a lot about all different kinds of electronics here.
good,"This having been my second job in the retail world, I was impressed at the differences between Best Buy and my previous employer. The company really does strive to be understanding of the needs of their employees and to work with them on availability. Each store is a little different in the management that is there, but overall everyone really seems to care about the employees well being. "
good,Working at Best Buy was a great decision. I was in college and was a tech nerd and needed some extra cash. This helped me in all of those areas!! Great management team.
good,Best buy mobile was one of my favorite places to work. They focused a lot on team building and overall teamwork. We always were rewarded and recognized for our accomplishments.
good,"A normal day for me at geek squad is being the face of the company greeting the clients and diagnosing the computers. check the computers in so agents can check them out. Most geek squad precincts have two agents, one that checks the computers in and 1 that does the repairs but I do both the check in and repair on the computers. I will also check the computer to the client and make sure they are satisfied with the work that was done. I lead my store in sales of services, and 2nd in turn time (Getting the computer repaired and back to the client in a certain time)."
good,"When i first started the place had a wonderful environment and was encouraged every day to succeed (not threatened), the management was amazing, the work family was close. After certain managers took position and then some great people left Best Buy was a bit different. The typical day never changed, still came in filled out numbers, reported to manager to get signed off, went about day contacting customer, creating sales, and striving for branded payments. Several of the managers at the store are amazing but there are a few that should not have any business being a manager because their management method was threatening and brash. The general manager can be harsh but when he needs to be, has a uplifting attitude as well as the Operations manager also amazing always ready to tell you what you need to work on to better but not what your doing wrong....constructive, which is how all managers should be. The job itself i truly enjoyed, whenever a customer comes in and you build that solution that gives them their perfect setup and they walk out and always come back directly to you, its a great feeling. the hardest part of job was dealing with specific managers criticism (never constructive)"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I had a nice work from home job it was great.  Very flexible little to no supervision makes life easier.  The bad part was the pay and lack of job security.
good,"I was hired for seasonal this past seasonal period and I loved it. The fast pace when it was busy was fun, and when it was slow it was easy to occupy yourself with other things to do."
good,Employee Pricing/ Discount is crazy good and the company is energetic! Fun way to advance knowledge of sales.  The company does pay for everything when it comes to training. Would recommend.
good,"Okay, I have overall had an decent experience at this company. At the Autotech Level there is plenty of training that enables you to learn your job and how to be good at your job."
good,"Best Buy has a good working environment. Best buy provides their employees with a very generous discount and has great managers that are friendly and easy to talk to. Great co-workers and very friendly environment. Also great training, they don't just throw you into the water and expect you to swim"
good,"This is a great company to work for if you like to learn about technology, are sociable, and looking to gain experience. It is important to provide proper tech solutions for customers and this requires you to learn how to recognize their needs as well as be knowledgeable on what products are available."
good,"entertaining and always on your feet. Although sometimes hectic, there was always a moment to feel grateful. Management had its downside but altogether a great starting environment."
good,Best Buy was a great place to start my career. I continue to use things I learned from so may people in my work today. I had a great time during my time there.
good,"A typical day consists of meeting company numbers and working with clients. The job is to offer a ""complete solution"" and keep customers coming back to the store. This company will make sure you have decent accomodations and ample learning material. Management in some locations are not the best but your coworkers will make it bearable in the end! Overall, not a bad place to work especially in retail."
good,"Although retail jobs aren't what most people aspire to obtain, they do have their benefits - specifically Best Buy. Best Buy is centered around learning as much as possible about cool, productive, entertaining products, and relating this information to each client/guest to better their experience in this tech-driven age we all live in. "
good,"I enjoy working for Best Buy, overall. The work I complete is engaging, and the culture within the company is phenomenal. Employees buy into the values and generally bring their best self to work each day. Leadership is hit or miss, and if you have poor leadership it can be really hard to enjoy the work you do. However, there are a lot of great leaders that really take the time to care for each individual employee."
good,"Best Buy is a great gig. I was in sales and taught me about prioritizing,responsibility, & persistents. I was fairly compensated for my services. I would recommend a sales job at Best Buy."
good,Fun place to work with great learning path for those who have never worked in sales before. Development path is great for associates who have a desire to advance in the retail industry.
good,I enjoyed working for the company overall but the ability to advance is very slim. If I had the ability to advance I would have stayed with the company longer.
good,"Retail at Best Buy was engaging and fast paced, never a slow day at work and there was always a variety of tasks to complete that varied from just my own job duties."
good,"Generally a fun environment, everyone was well intentioned. Traffic was very slim so there's a decent amount of downtime which you can fill with mandatory trainings"
good,"Sales floor is a great place to work especially for students. "
good,"When i worked there i was in inventory so i was responsible for stock and such, The management i had directly above me was very good i am still personal friends with one of my old bosses, Workplace is fairly stressful because it is retail. The individuals who worked there were very laid back and i am still friends with many of my old co workers."
good,"Good place to work at especially if still in school, because they work around your school schedule. Not to mention the discounts on certain items were great."
good,"Best Buy was always great at trying to better their employees. While it seemed sort of tedious, they had ""programs"" you could complete while it was slow in the store. These programs helped educate you on what products where in the store so that everyone was able to help when there was a question from a customer."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Overall, Best Buy is a great company to work for if you are very tech savvy. This was my second job and fell in love. The thing that drove me away was management. I never really got along with them that much."
good,Love the day to day interaction with customers and associates. Upper field management changes directions too often without great communication. Great pay and benefits.
good,"Overall Operations of the Store. Good Culture, team engagement. Best Buy believes in helping the customer as much as possible even when the customer is outside normal policies."
good,"Good H.S job, worked there for a bit as an STA. Requires you to meet goals and benchmarks which can be stressful at times. But overall not a hard or horrible job to have."
good,"What I learned- Working at Best Buy, Maple Grove was an amazing way to gain experience in both sales, and guest services. I learned great work values that I will carry with me for the remainder of my career. The training that the company has to offer is top-of-the-line, and being cross-trained in departments is very common, and very easy to get into. "
good,"Best Buy is a job that I will always be grateful for, even if there were some cons to the position.  I enjoyed the work that I accomplished everyday and felt that my coworkers valued my hard work.  I got reasonable pay and consistent hours.  The downside was my supervisor, specifically.  He showed no appreciation for our accomplishments and was consistently negative, making the work sometimes difficult when he would be there.  Aside from that, I got quite a bit out of my experience at Best Buy."
good,"Hours always varied since I was seasonal/part time. But a typical day would be first make sure your department was cleaned up and stocked. I learned a lot from working on the sales floor. A little knowledge on how to sell yourself along with a product can make a huge difference in a persons life. Even just for that day, pleasing a customer and knowing he walked out of the store satisfied is what Best Buy is all about."
good,"A typical day on the job would be unloading a merchandise truck, putting merchandise away in the different departments around the store. Grabbing online orders, placing the proper tags on the orders and taking them to their designated place. Working in a team environment to get the truck process done in a sufficient amount of time, working closely with all management and leaders. The hardest part of the job is learning the department you are assigned to put merch away in. I love the people i work with they are fun, entertaining, and helpful it makes the job enjoyable."
good,"Starting off, the work environment and daily tasks are great for developing both intrapersonal and interpersonal skills. Management is also very supportive with their staff. The fellow co workers are always a treat to be around, and they make the overall occupation a reason to stay. At the same time, I do wish there was more room for moving up within the company versus hiring externally. I feel that if people within the company are given that opportunity, we will grow even more as a company."
good,I have bad to say about working here this job i messed up on my own and not anyone else fault. very good work environment respectable employees and overall good people.
good,"As a Sale Associate of Home theater my job was fairly simple. Become extremely knowledgeable about Best Buy's products and services and help customers get the best experience tailored for them. The best parts were the successful sales, learning with your co workers and applying that knowledge to your next sale."
good,"I loved working with Best Buy, it's a great company and there are multiple ways for advancement if you are willing to put in the work. I have many lifelong friendships that I made but ultimately left due to finding a job with my degree."
good,I Loved working at best-buy. great team and great customers. Learned a lot regarding customer service. Management was easy to get along with at times. Great work environment
good,"At Best Buy, I learned how to multi-task efficiently and how to handle difficult customers. The hardest part of the job was during the holiday season when it gets very busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to help the customers."
good,"The pay is decent and the hours are flexible. You will learn a lot about customer service and electronics. They offer a great learning network that teaches you so much. but don't expect to get a full-time position. At best buy full timers get paid as much as part-timers do but with the added responsibilities of having to act like a leader. full time does come with a bunch of benefits but by the time you have been there long enough to gain entry into a full-time position, you are already considering changing jobs. you get a raise every year IF you meet the requirements for one. meaning that you have to keep your sales stats up GSP, credit card apps, and people signing in with their rewards. The bar isn't that high its doable but annoying. Overall like I said before if you need money But don't need to pay your rent on time   Great place to work. Better start looking for a 2nd job because most of your co-workers will already be working 2."
good,"Upon starting work, its as if you're working with your close friends making each day fun besides the rush hours of course, even then it's fun/doable. Of course one does not slack off when working with co-workers as if they're your friends, still the job is well done. I have learned the ways of working well with others and interacting socially well with everyone including the customers of course. Management was well, checking areas and instructing/helping the area."
good,"I've worked plenty of retail jobs and best buy by far is one of the ones with most flexible schedule, the management is understanding as well most of the time. Its a new challenge everyday, somedays its really dead and thats to be expected from a retail job."
good,"Overall BestBuy is a fun place to work in, however there is not much to offer in terms of job advancement at the store I worked at, so the job tends to become stagnant after a certain time (at least personally)."
good,"Overall GeekSquad is a fun and challenging workplace if you are not in what is considered a ""small store"". I personally have been a consultation agent for over 2 years at GeekSquad in my store, however management have made promises to not only myself but to my colleagues as well for either pay raises or new jobs titles, neither of which have yet to occur."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best buy is a great place to work if you are just looking for a now job. I feel the big box retailers are in trouble and the management in this company does nothing to ease that. They have restructured the company cutting out management positions. Just going in the store if feels as if its spiraling downwards. Great place to work, I don't see the company staying open and competitive for much longer though."
good,I love technology and working at Best Buy allowed me to be on the ground level so to speak to see all of the innovative tech consumer p roducts. Staff had a family feel to it.
good,"to many reorganizations."
good,good place to work. Management was always nice and helpful. It was easy to speak with co-workers while working AND get things done correctly and on time.
good,"This is a great company to work for. Best Buy really care about their company and their staff. Since working for the past 2 years, I must say this is a great company to work for."
good,"My days start with powering on and checking displays are functional. Then, after all that is done, I do weekly retail planogram work for the store. "
good,great warehouse over all very clean and productive place. great people that are determine to get their job done and are motivated managers leads supervisors are helpful motivating understating and great. they show fairness to everyone and they are happy to lend a hand if asked for help
good,"Great company to work for, friendly and helpful employees, fair pay and benefits"
good,In summary great place to begin a sales experience but very hectic environment a lot of training to get you ready for the job great on the job training if u cant handle non stop customer interaction not the job for you.
good,This store was busy but management ran things smoothly and efficiently. Expectations were laid out and job requirements explained and trained properly.
good,I was one of the top performing agents in my precinct and was regarded as a lead till an actual leadership position was opened. Another employee from another department had applied and was given the position as a deal for being rejected for another department. Politics come to play in Best Buy more often then once perceived. I left do to being bullied consistently and told I am not worth much in my department even though I meet my sales goal and have positive reviews from over 90% of my clientele. The sales district manager for Geek Squad adored me and that was the only time my manager and lead would see as an importance.
good,An excellent place to work at if you're into technology and the such. I learned a lot about A/V and if I had been offered more hours as a part-timer I would've definitely stayed longer. Management was good with clear and concise goals presented monthly and the people were friendly and very informative.
good,"Really high energy computer repair spot.  Day is constantly changing and you have to be able to multitask.  From a repair position, it can be trying at times to manage your attention across 15 computers, returned TV and a phone ringing off the hook all it once.  The environment is fun and most of your coworkers have a good time.  Geek Squad pushes sales over the repair work which can be pressing if your job is the repair work, as sometimes your attention is deviated to selling services rather than performing them.  I did enjoy my job with Geek Squad."
good,"Great company, comparable pay, and great coworkers. I work in computer sales and i really enjoy getting to know the customer and their needs. I do not like that associates are supposed to meet sales numbers that are constant and do not fluctuate based on business peak times."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming, greeting all my co-workers, Greeting all the customers, checking out some New Technology, and just having a great time. I've learned how to work in a Fast-Paced Environment, Learned how to be a Team Player, Learned how to manage a Group of Customers simultaneously and learned how to use all the Best Buy Computer Utilities to Help Customers experience be Efficient and Knowledgeable. "
good,Best buy is all about technology and I thought it was going to be fun helping people out with figuring out their tech. In reality I was simply a cashier. Long hours on feet.
good,"good managers and employees, good hours, fun environment, get to play with new tech but there are difficult customers, red tape preventing easy resolutions of issues and the occasional crazy person that walks in."
good,I actually really like Best Buy as a company you have people there willing to work with you usually on scheduling even if you are in school they will work around what you need pay isn't the best but it's also not the worst for a retail job.
good,"Easy work, just tedious. Helping customers find the total solution the first time so we have increased profit margins and low erosion, as far as returns and exchanges are concerned."
good,"It is a company that you will be pushed to work very hard, because of the nature of the business, what you do is generally not good enough.  A very much ""What have you done for me today"" mentality.  They will compensate you very well, but the work life balance is not good, you will always be connected to work if you are in a management position."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The best part about working at Best Buy is being able to see the most updated technology on a daily basis. It is a retail job, however, so customer interactions can vary."
good,Follows rules and regulations as per documents given to you. Things are great as long you do your job and make the company money.  You have to make sure to promote credit cards.
good,"Work here was fun, yet it was always filled with education and training. The management and lead staff were helpful and everyone wanted everyone else to succeed."
good,"Best buy is a good job to work, managers are very nice and caring. they give flexible working hours and have very good benefits. Most customers are easy to work with and are very understanding."
good,I loved working for this company. I just had issues in going back to work after having my son. I was unable to return after my maternity leave. I would work their again.
good,"nice pace to work. learn about all the new technologies, they send you out for training and the helps in learning how to sell and get to be social with customers"
good,"Was a great place to work but, I relocated loved the culture but hated working on the weekends. Other than that it was a great experience. Great people and I loved being around all the new tech."
good,"My day starts at 3:05am....in the building at 4:15am...Shift is 1st shift; working to the volume on Inbound Operations. "
good,"Of my work with corporate companies, Best Buy was one of my favorites. They like hard work and people who are willing to learn and can be versatile. Within a year I went from a seasonal employee to their Inventory Integrity Specialist, however, you basically have to wait for someone to leave or die in order to get advancement."
good,"If you like to start working in retail, Best Buy is a great place to work and learn new things everyday. Benefits are great and getting paid hourly not the best pay check but in the end, it's alright. You will start to develop your skills in customer service, team work, and interact with customers."
good,grate place to start working with technology and if you are sales oriented. it's a place where you will be exposed to consumer electronics.
good,A typical day at work consisted of dealing with a myriad of different personalities. From colleagues and management to guests each day brought a new experience. This has bolstered my ability to work in any situation.
good,"Checking in and working at the store was fairly simple for me; walk in, clock in, then take a place up front, greeting customers and enticing them to check out the stock. That was only sales, however, the other half of the job was activating and selling phones. It was a big process that I could never get into because of my short time there. The sales portion of the job was where I really learned that the position required a more personable employee than I was. Management was willing to work with me on these issues and gave me lots of advice on improving my ability. Coworkers made the environment one more relaxed, engaging in conversation during downtime, unlike some other jobs."
good,"Typical day at Best Buy consisted of myself making sure I have all the necessary tools to make my sales pitch successful. I want to give my customers the best advice possible with each product that they may have questions on. Best Buy is a team oriented environment, co-workers rely on certain co-workers for help at times depending on their specific job title in the store. The hardest part about the job would definitely be learning a new product that is low in demand because not too much information is out there for myself, as a former employee to learn about these specific products. The most enjoyable part would definitely be the customers that comes in, with such a wide range of personalities and questions, every conversation is different. My former co-workers there were also very engaging and helpful when called upon as well."
good,"The store I was located at in Virginia Beach, VA was great. I had good input into my hours and flexibility of both week and month schedule. This despite being a part-time employee. Most work associates were friendly. I loved interacting with the customers, and helping them in their store needs. The training offered is exceptional, and there is a lot of opportunity for advancement. I ended up leaving due to moving and being busier with my schooling."
good,"Customer comes in and explain to me their computer needs, then I offer them a total solution. I learned how to work with the general public. I learned how to use different computer systems. I have to down stock and clean up the department. It is a good working environment, I was given help when I needed it but left alone if I do not need any help."
good,"All around it was a good job. Management was great, Environment was okay it had its week or constant bad weeks, tend to be a lot of drama. culture was good. the job so far was easy hardest part is when corporate randomly changes things and is never at the work place to know how it works. and most enjoy was making customers happy"
good,"Typical work day consisted of organizing the store and the the area I would be working. Walking the store helping coworkers when I was not busy. Making sure the customers needs were met. Answering every question to the best of my knowledge and if I didn't know I would find out and let them up front I didn't know. I learned a lot about technology and cell being that was my primary department. The workplace as a whole was upbeat and fun 98% of the time. Everyone was willing to help out, even if it was not their department. Two of the hardest parts of the job were when we exhausted every option we had and there nothing left we could for the customer. The other was that it was only seasonal and it unfortunately had to end. The most enjoyable part was that it wasn't commission so there was no need to push, just be honest and give the customer what they needed and see them leave happy and satisfied."
good,A stable place to work. They really thrive on the passion of their employees which leaves opportunities for growth. Ever changing policies and micromanaging made it difficult for a person who had been their 10 years to keep that passion without wanting the manager role.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.

good,Best buy is a great job if you are going to school they work around your schedule and understand as long as you talk to them about it before you semster starts. Management was cool they were easy to talk to and kept it real.
good,"Best Buy was a workplace full of surprises and with amazing people that will help you the moment you need it. Management does have its ups and downs but at most, they do an exceptional job when it comes to listening to both their employees and the customers."
good,"Learned many sales tactics and customer relation techniques to more efficiently get the line moving along."
good,"bestbuy is a great company to work for for all the years i was there i received nothing but great training from the management team."
good,"A lot of the actual work was tedious tasks like shipping units out for further repair or filing paper work. Occasionally you would have the opportunity for a more serious repair but  that was mostly looked down upon and left for shipping to ""Geek Squad City""."
good,"Other employees were very nice. Management was very easy to get ahold of and talk to. Was a relaxing easy, and efficient job."
good,I really enjoyed working here for as long as I did. You worked with fun staff around your same age and was constantly learning about new technology.
good,"A typical day at my most recent employer consisted of constant down stocking, product protection, alignment, customer satisfaction, and small tasks. I learned how to ensure that all product was shown but also protected and I learned how to efficiently manage multiple tasks in one work day. The management team mostly treated you like family if you work hard, so I was close to many of the managers. The hardest part of my job was that is was very tedious and repetitive. The most enjoyable part of my job was close interaction with my coworkers and customers."
good,"The working environment is always encourage, fun filled and work-life balance. It is Commitment to Employees and Customers , Training and Assessment are the best."
good,"Both stores that I worked for had good people working for there, also the management was always pushing their employees to better themselves. I enjoyed working here just changing the work that's needed."
good,"Trained to be knowledgeable in appliances to provide customers with accurate information for their purchase. "
good,Great Place to work not so great management typical day to day is great you learn about all the cool new tech and gadgets and help customers pick which best suits their needs
good,"Atypical day at work for me started around 7am, we had our meeting in the morning of what is expected from us. I learned so much form working with this company, from electronics to customer service. Management, at both stores I worked out we great, they helped me when I asked for help. the co-workers were nothing but friendly, some were competitive, but nothing really wrong with that. The hardes part of the job was keeping up with the latest technology. The most enjoyable part of the job, was learning about all the new technology."
good,Its fun in the sense that there are a lot of interesting people working there and is a very social job. I also found it interesting to learn about the technology.
good,"Enjoyable work days "
good,"i worked Best buy/geek squad for a few months a few years ago as a seasonal Christmas job. it was a decent job i actually really liked it. my co workers where fantastic, the jobs where interesting , and it gave me a real sense of accomplishment"
good,"Great place to work, great environment, awesome company, awesome management, awesome employee discount.  I get to work with amazing people everyday while serving fortune 500 companies."
good,Best Buy has a great sense of the retail world and how it should work. Sales and leadership training for their employees is unmatched and relevant to most jobs. I really enjoy being a part of the Best Buy family.
good,"Worked at this Best buy for about 5 years, it was a fun and enjoyable place to work.  Meet great customer and great coworkers"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,We would start the day playing some customer service divider volleyball. Continuing that we worked in a very relaxed and fun environment. Management was good and everyone who worked there was like one big family. The hardest part like every retail job was the holiday. Yet even with that the environment and flexibility of the job was ideal.
good,"Fun, laid back environment with supportive peers and managers.  Lots of different areas to move into and move between as well as ways to get engaged outside of your everyday job to get more involved in the best buy culture"
good,I learn a lot with my time at best buy.  my co-workers was nice to work with and we learned from each other.  The hardest part of the job was when our department was short staff and hours and you're stuck doing the job of sometimes more than two people but you can always count on me to get the job done.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my co-workers together to get the job done and to see everyone faces at the end when we actually got the job accomplished.  Management could always count on me with my experience to make sure everything is in line and being done correctly.
good,"A weekday at Best Buy is mostly filled with stock movement from the warehouse to the sales floor, while being interrupted by customers. I've learned to know a moderate amount about the products we sell, so i can help customers as fast as i can, so i can go back to my job. Management is good. Favorites are picked, like anywhere you work. People don't get in trouble for most things they deserve to be disciplined for, etc etc. Your relationships with co-workers is what you make it. Can't expect to get along with every person on this earth. Hardest thing about the job is getting all the tasks done each day, in the time you are given. Constantly understaffed and over budget for labor. Seeing all the new technology and getting to put most of it on display so the community can play with it is the best thing about this job. It has given me ideas to help my own life with technology, and I've learned much about the direction technology is heading. The feeling is like peeing your pants in a black suit, you feel warm about the thing you did, but not a single person will notice."
good,"Good company...Market staff is muddled."
good,"Great co-workers"
good,"it was ok, i enjoyed meeting people and discussing tech most. I worked there for 2 and a half years. it was fun sometimes but other times it could be hard to make daily goal but after my first year. I was able to catch on to it better."
good,Fun to work at if you can understand the politics. Just get on your manager's good side and you will have a great experience.
good,"Loved the Company, tough business with all the online business. Training is solid and consistent. Great Company with allot of great talented leaders..."
good,"Working here is sometimes stressful, but it is directly related to the customers. Management is mostly understanding on a personal level when needing time off for emergencies. However, while there is a yearly pay raise in place, current management refuse to give much advancement (more than 15 to 20 cents) and even if an employee is meeting goals, will find a way to rate you average to avoid a significant raise. Favoritism is also a problem in this work place."
good,"Best. buy is a fun, fast paced retail company to work for. Best Buy is s performance based company with bonuses available every single month. Work hard at Best Buy, and Best Buy will definitly return the favor."
good,"I have worked in two different stores and have enjoyed both. They are like everyone else trying to push add-ons to customers and hound employees to meet quotas. Sales associates need to meet a quota for which there is no commission but you do get paid hourly and possible bonuses. They really want you to push credit cards and service plans. While There are huge benefits to both. Especially geek squad is a very strong extra protection. The managers have all been nice people, but you can tell they are under pressure. Constantly tracking numbers and coaching employees on how to get better. Obviously, some are better than others and some are horrible. But overall good people. My main reason for staying with the company are the benefits outside of pay and my coworkers. If you like tech, you're in the right place and will always find new friends with similar interests. The discounts are great and the merchant special discounts are even better. The culture is also great. I have been treated to, Pizza, Donuts, BBQ, Game nights and so on."
good,"Every so often you get cool little perks. I like the discount, however job is starting to become monotonous after a year. If I wanted to make a career out of this job I could see a more positive outlook, however management plays a little bit of favorites."
good,It's a fun place to work with a great staff that work with your schedule. Going into work knowing that you play a role in the company is a great feeling so you won't feel under apriciated .
good,"Working at Best Buy, helped me in dealing and managing large amount of currency and assisted me in learning and expanding my social skills to be able to help any customer in need of help."
good,BestBuy as a strong and solid corporate culture. Fun environment to work with knowledgeable staff that is truly passionate about technology and service.
good,"A typical day at work would begin with arriving five to fifteen minutes early, prepare my desk and sign into the computer. The days would by quickly, working steady."
good,"At Best Buy you are forced to learn. If this excites you, then you will like this job. You will need to have pockets of knowledge about almost everything. There are definite training methods that you will need to adapt to. It's an overall good environment."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Work day consisted of helping customers find the proper solution for their electronic needs."
good,"There is always something to be done at work, never a dull moment. Between going to get picks for online orders or doing carry outs for customers actually in the store."
good,"Really enjoyed my time at Best Buy, however it can get old quick due to constant corporate structures nagging for increased numbers. No matter how well you do, more is always expected of you. Room for advancement is pretty difficult, as there aren't many positions to move up to. The job really gives you a good doorway experience for professionalism. Management motivation is great and makes for a fun and productive atmosphere!"
good,"Bien que le but de l'entreprise était de servir les clients, nous étions bien former pour toutes les tâches que nous avions à faire"
good,This was my second job out of high school and was a great work environment. Very flexible on scheduling around school and for part time employees.
good,if your young and njoy learning technology there is no better place to work. its just really hard to make it a career but if gives you a great expereince
good,"It was a fun work experience and I enjoy the sales floor, helping people find solutions. I manage cellphone accounts and help find the best plan for best price."
good,The time I served gave me a great deal of insight on the world and myself as an individual. Invaluable experiences and opportunities are provided when enlisted.
good,"I love my job but if you are part-time then your hours are extremely low.  Imagine going to a fast food restaurant and have the same employee take your order, bring you your food, clean tables, answer phone calls, mop floors, take out trash and another employee in the back doing the cooking.  As much as I love my job, this is what Geek Squad has become...one agent expected to do everything by themselves.  I hope things turn around; not so much for myself but I feel the customer deserves better."
good,At a 24 hour store there was always work to do. Often times musicians would stop in on the night of their album release. Management was very well organized and always knew what you were up to personally.
good,"Working as an asset protection specialist for Best Buy is a good foot in the door working with CCTV and interacting with customers, however, the company does not allowed for their agents to make any citizens arrest on dishonest customers, and this mainly because of liability."
good,Very organized and want to see you grow. They train you and equip you with all the knowledge you need to succeed. Coworkers were all friendly and worked as a team.
good,Great place to have fun and work. It was hard for me to gain enough hours to really be able to take it further.
good,"A typical day consisted of assisting customers with the purchasing of their technology needs.  I was a computer sales associate but did have the opportunity to cross train in many other departments.  I learned a lot about new emerging technology which was fun for me since I probably wouldn't have had this opportunity otherwise.  I also learned a little about how to sell to customers, although I had many years of this training in a previous job.  The co-workers I worked with were great.  Typically if the person was a good fit for this kind of work they melded into the group just grand.  Management usually consisted men and women with a good head for business and a great sense of humor.  I enjoyed the job while I had it."
good,Employees are all willing to help in almost any situation. Management works with employees to increase sales and work on people skills effectively.
good,I loved my job with Best Buy. I played a very active role in grand opening four stores with best buy. three stores in Oklahoma and one in Colorado. I was promoted 4 times in 3 years.
good,"Even thought I wasn't there long I really enjoyed working there the training or there system was great."
good,"Considérant le travaille effectué, un taux horaire ne semble pas adapté. Il devrait plutôt s'agir d'un salaire à commission pour être proportionnel au travail effectué."
good,I get to see newest devices and Operating systems as they came out through the years and meet differnet people of all ages.
good,"Fun place to work for lots of opportunities for job growth or change if you would like a different title. Worked as sales and learned a lot on how to treat customers well, worked in the warehouse and learned how to make a day run smoothly by keeping the store ready to go. Best Buy tends to get involved with volunteer services and has fun get togethers every now and then."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,This job is very challenging. You're going to learn so much working here. The hardest part about the job are the rude customers.
good,Great place to work if you like electronics. I was sales support and I learned how to manage orders. Enjoyable part of work would be my coworkers.
good,"It is a very solid company to work for, great people around, and great customers. Sometimes the job may get a little boring but its a solid job."
good,Very good atmosphere. Great employee discount. Teach you a lot on how to build your customer service. Great place to learn about the latest technology and gadgets.
good,"Its cool to work with all the new technology, it just sucks how you're pushed to sell but make no commission. I believe that being a computer sales man made my selling skills and over all knowledge about computers better. I recommend this job."
good,Training was fairly good from corporate but hit or miss in stores themselves. Employees are mostly younger college age. It is a fun place to be if you are into electronics or media
good,"Working for Geek Squad as a field agent gives you a lot of flexibility."
good,Working at BestBuy as taught me so much patient in working with employees as well as customers. I have unleash the power in me and allow me to see my true potential. It a wonderful and fun environment and it has help me in a tremendous ways on how to deal with stressors. A typical day at sometimes its good and sometimes its bad but I learned how to deal with it as the days goes by. Management  teach me how to deal with difficult customers and also to be better at my job; provide optimal customer service to customers even the difficult ones. I am a team players so I work wonderful with my co-workers. They teach me things and I do the say. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers especially when it comes on to returns and exchange. Customers tend not to read the return policy and return and try t disrespect workers because we are following the policy that the company outline. the most enjoyable part of the job is to see a smile and satisfaction on the customers face when you find a solution to their problem and they walking confidently out the door knowing that they product is going to work.
good,"Really enjoyed my time at Best Buy, especially the management and team I worked with.  Felt more like family than co-workers."
good,"it's a decent workplace, very good to help with stoma service skills and learn about media and technology. Can occasionally be fun"
good,"Very good work place, good environment, worked well with my school schedule. As a cashier I had a very good supervisor, it was an easy enough job, they never asked for anything crazy just be friendly, help other departments and check customers out."
good,"Best Buy was a very good company, every employee hired had an amazing personality so it made work fun. The benefits were great, and they worked around my school schedule with me. The only thing that made me want to leave was management, I personally felt like there was a lot of favoritism and she was unprofessional at times. Other than that my experience there was great."
good,The management was good with scheduling hours around my school schedule. They offered great benefits and many opportunity for advancements.
good,"Lead the team and drive the financial and operational outcomes of the Precinct"
good,"The company... Well it is BestBuy, its a nice place to work there for what is for or to have a nice little part time job. They do underpay their employees a lot even though BestBuy success it is based mainly on them. I learned a lot of new stuff about Sales Consultant and Customer Service, this place did teach me a lot of things. Management was very amazing to be honest, you give respect to your peers period. Meeting new people every day and working around  my peers was the best!"
good,Everyday started with friendly smiles and quick jokes with my co-workers before the fast paced day kicked off. I became a more adapt salesman and people person through my time with this company. As a natural salesman I had no hard time with this job. The most enjoyable would be experiencing the fast paced sales environment where I strived to be and became the best salesman in the store.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Its was excited, the day would go past like every other day however the customers made it interesting. Very homely feeling within the employee. Its was like one big family."
good,It is good company to start. You can learn alot as a fresher. You learn something which you can use in corporate world and will be benefitial for you.
good,"An individual's experience at Best Buy is heavily influenced by the part of the organization into which they report. It can range from high stress with long hours to a great work-life balance. In areas that are higher stress the reward for hard work can be just as high. Generally, Best Buy does a good job at recognizing individuals that perform well and have future potential."
good,"Great place to work at, coworkers are positive, benefits for part timers after a year of working with the company. Pay was okay, lots of paid training."
good,"BestBuy is a company that teaches you, not only to sell products and attach warranties or geek squad, they teach you how to behave in any scenario with any customer and to get the job done ethically. "
good,"A typical day at work is not very busy. It depends on the number of customers who come to the shop for purchase. I learnt a lot about customer (buyer/seller) relationship. My co-workers were also friendly. There is no hard part about the job. I enjoyed the job but it was not challenging,"
good,"This was a fun place for me to work. The environment is great and learning about new products always kept me interested. However, most employees at my store have little to no hours, unless you're working a long shift, there are no breaks or lunch breaks."
good,"Low pay and bad hours unless you get into a position like Geek Squad, management, auto motive. The specialty positions."
good,"Retail is a tough gig while trying to finish school, but Best Buy was more than willing to work with me in order to ensure I graduate as well as get the hours I want. The culture is great and everyone is always willing to help and train another. Best Buy has definitely helped me grow as a person and solidify my interpersonal skills. No shy person ever made it far in a job that requires you speak to everyone that walks through the door."
good,"Loved the people that I worked with, but didn't feel like I had a chance to advance.  When I tried to transfer I wasn't able to continue with Best buy which was very disappointing."
good,"Sure some days are stressful from all of the people coming in there, but we push through it and make the day."
good,"Your team became like a second family, the management were usually flexible, but the opportunity to move up were better for external applicants rather than internal associates. This job is great for students that need the flexibility, but get out when you find something better otherwise they will always say you will get the next promo...and never do."
good,"Work/life balance was generally the opportunity, as you had to work every weekend.  The work was gratifying, as your performance was dictated by you and your team's own ability to make them better salespeople.  The focus was on training and product knowledge and 100% about the experience the customer has in your store."
good,"Good place to work. Doesn't provide areas to grow or provide good hours. Overall, the company does provide good job security though."
good,"I enjoyed working here. Like before, the managers could get a bit one sided and favoritism was seen. But I was always busy and enjoyed the people I work with. I regret leaving there."
good,Great company to work for I would recommend this job for someone looking for a part time with a flexible schedule. I would like to think Best But always gets great reviews.
good,"I worked in the Camera department at Best Buy. I absolutely loved the people I was surrounded by. We always had fun while still being a top performing store. "
good,Working at Best Buy is a great place to learn about current technology and techniques to help improve the customers shopping experience.
good,"Great place to work overall, people are amazing, everyone will speak up if there is any issues."
good,"I learned how to handle large projects, how to formulate strategies to complete work efficiently and effectively. Time management skill and adapting to change quickly are very important in this role also being able to learn new technology quickly and being able to implement on the fly is a key to success in this position. My co-workers are great we all have a different skill set that enables us to work well together. The hardest part of my job is getting started because we have to absorb so much information and produce a plan of execution before we can start and this is different at each store we work at. The most enjoyable part of my job is being see and play with new technology before the general public."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I worked as a seasonal person for Best Buy, so I wasn't there long. It definitely is not a proper environment for laid back people. You go there to work hard and sell products, just like any other retail job. For the time I was there, it was good. They do keep track of how much you sell, but that comes with the territory of a electronics retailer that Best Buy is. That should be no surprise. If I was there longer, I would have gotten a much bigger spectrum of how the company operates, but they definitely focus on customers' needs being met. If you love electronics, love to sell products to people and be in a friendly but goal oriented atmosphere, this is the place for you. I would definitely recommend it if those are all  a yes. And the co-workers are awesome, at least at the village pointe location. It is a diffucult job to master, but easy to learn the basics. Always smile when around customers. And ALWAYS MOVE AROUND. Never sit still. That's something I could have improved on for the time I was there. It helps so you get more exposure to how things work and to help practice for other things you could be involved in at Best Buy. They do have online training that does help if you actually pay attention to it. A lot of it is required, but they DO HELP, If you let it. All in all, I'd at least give it a shot."
good,Learning to build new displays and or displaying new product for the company was exciting and eventful.  Over the years working with tools I've never worked with before. A very fast paced envirornment but exciting at the same time.
good,"c'était un bon poste, qui permet de communiquer le plus avec les clients et d'aller en avant dans les compétences personnelles."
good,Lots of fun and a great chance to learn about new technologies. Great opportunities to grow however I hope that they are more proactive in the future to advance within the company.
good,"cross training knowledge of products"
good,A normal day in the life at Best Buy.   When we were there the employees we're  helpful and knowlegeable in there area of expertise  and enjoyed working with such a great team.
good,"My typical day consist of engaging clients, offering Geek Squad services  and answering question about their devices (smart tv, smart watches, tablets, pc's, etc). Throughout my years at Best Buy I've gained an excellent amount of customer service experience and learned more than I have ever thought I would about computers. For me, the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the client comprehend how certain systems and or devices work and as a result having the client gain that peace of mind."
good,"I TRULY enjoyed working at Best Buy. Although salesmen are underpaid (and no commission, really?) It's fun to have as a part time job. You're not overworked like some retail jobs (which will work you 12 hours once a week), although holiday season will mean a lot more work. The management is more than willing to work on your sales skills with you patiently to make sure you're doing your very best, and the company will literally pay you gas money to go to a different city and stay in a hotel to complete a sales training program they call ""Induction."""
good,"First we would receive deliveries from two to three trucks. We would unload all items from the truck and place them in different carts. Each cart was sent to different departments of the store. Then we would sort them and organize them. Finally, After our first objective was complete we would sort out the stock room ( TVs, air conditioners, Microwaves, etc.) and make it easier for employees to find what they need."
good,Best buy is a great place to work. Being able to work with every new piece of technology is exciting and fun. You receive training and for the most part are given all the tools to succeed.
good,"Lots of room for advancement, on the go training. Lots of benefits such as health and dental but also bonus, and extra rewards."
good,If looking for something to get your work experience this is the right place. I hope you will get caring managers. Quick in promotions if you work hard enough.
good,Great part-time job just looking for more hrs. Relocated to NC and had to leave the company.  Mgnt. was always there to listen and work things out if a problem came up.  Enjoyed my time there.
good,"It's not the best money, it's not the best schedule, but the managers were all great, and professional. Everyone at the store meshed together, and work was fun. It was a rewarding place, with well-appointed facilities, solid work, and a comfortable work environment."
good,"un ambiente laboral de trabajo agradable , se siente llevar puesto el trabajo ya que se muestra gran crecimiento de trabajo como de vida , gran apoyo con el equipo . , pude tener un crecimiento personal ya que era una persona introvertida gracias a este trabajo me pude desenvolver mas con los clientes como en la vida , ahora tengo mas facilidad de tener una conversación  con otra persona . los compañeros de trabajo siempre me ayudaron por que nunca tuvieron alguna indiferencia con migo a si como yo con ellos  a si podíamos hablar bien y darnos retro alimentaciones para poder mejorar en el ámbito del trabajo"
good,I always found myself surrounded by like minded individuals. Technology is always advancing and there's always a cool new thing to learn about and sell. Big box retail problems do exist. time off around the holidays is rare
good,"At this company I learn something new everyday with my current title. I install remote starts, radios, speakers, dvd players and every day presents a new challenge. My coworkers are fast learners and eager to learn about my part of the business, the most enjoyable part of the job is the new obstacles I face on a daily basis."
good,"Gained much experience with how to work with a great team of individuals, coworkers and managers were really nice, gained knowledge on customer service, days at work were always fun and a great learning opportunity!"
good,I love the people there and its a great company. The store taught me a lot to accompany my life with. I learned great essentials tasks to keep with me as i go on to other careers in life .All in all it just not for  me as a career.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Great company.  Great training, great at mostly everything.  Except,  when a long-time employee has an issue with a manager, they don't have a great process to follow to rectify the issue at hand."
good,"I learn about customer service,"
good,"You are constantly in motion whether it be with a client at the counter or working problems. This job hones your problem solving abilities into a fine point as you move from task to task in rapid succession. If you cant deal with shifting tasks rapidly then this job is not for you. "
good,Fun workplace with some supportive management. We were focused on numbers along with the happiness of the customers. Not much help from corporate but it is a big company. The most enjoyable part of my day was working with the people I work with  and making a customer happy.
good,Best Buy is a growing company that continues to strive for the best within their employees and more so towards their consumers. The company allows employees to share a variety of brands with customers without employees having a biased opinion. There is so much to learn when you first start with Best Buy but your fellow co-workers are always there to help.
good,"- Représentante du service à la clientèle (opérations);"
good,Awesome place to work for if you love electronics. Amazing people you can meet their. You get to play with the new and coolest electronic toys on the market. The hardest part of the job was to sell the best buy credit card and helping out with other departments. The most enjoyable part was the Black Friday cause our team of managers would get us food and drinks for the battle we will have the customers on the busiest day of shopping.
good,"Good Company to work for, I out grow the company, needed better hours for my than growing family.  Long hours standing and walking all day."
good,I loved my coworkers. Management had too many changes while I was there. The pay and bonuses where great. Also loved our discount.
good,"A great place to start out! Very flexible with school. Always learning something new and gives you the tools to do so. Management is a hit and miss, more politics than merit. Some stores have great managers and make the work place the best, others are there just to collect a paycheck and only care about numbers."
good,"Employees are well taken care of By this Company . I started as a loss prevention specialist and was promoted to Inventory/Operations Leadership within 2 Years."
good,"Fun Work place and I enjoyed my days with my co workers, days were sometimes stressful though, because training was very ""on the job"" and sometimes I felt like I was being thrown into the lions den. There were some times where we had time to get trained on the computers, but customers always assume you know everything about all technology, so it can be hard when you dont have an answer for them. overall, fun and enjoyable."
good,"It's an okay place, only issue is compensation isn't as great as you would have hoped. From what I hear it is a thousand times better working for Apple."
good,This is a great place to work when you are going to college flexible hours and friendly co-workers that enjoy good competition.  We have monthly contests to see who does the best with services or credit card applications and the managers are very easy to talk to.  It does however leave room for improvement on proper compensation and lacks the ability to advance unless someone you know is quitting the won't promote you even if you're more suitable for the role than the person there.  I enjoy the non commission sales team because we can actually help the customer with what they need not what's profitable and I truly like the way that the business runs but I can't work for the small amount of compensation that they give for their employees that get amazing results.
good,Overall enjoyed my experience as an employee and learned a lot from working with the company as far as tools I can use in the future. The employees were friendly and inviting as well as management. I enjoyed working alongside cops and established great relationships with successful people.
good,Normally every day is pretty fun because of the people I work with. Customers are usually pretty nice. Its a pretty good starting our job. Management makes really good money.
good,"This company has mainly young adults working while going to school. Overall, a fun environment but the management is the reason many people are leaving this store."
good,"Working for Geek Squad is a great place to start in an IT career. You work with great people every day, and you get to help people with their computer problems."
good,Geek Squad as a brand is incredible and the value to customers is quite the deal. The work environment is quite fun and not too hectic. Workload is also consistent and productivity is well balanced. Also very team oriented.
good,BestBuy is a great place to work they give you the tools and skills you need to be a leader! They are really big on the development and unleashing the power in the customer and the employees as well!
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy had a lot of perk's, It's a great place to grow and learn what it truly mean to work in the sales industry."
good,"Overall was a great place to work and learn from, only downside was the management at this location was never on top of things"
good,Great place to work at. I was getting to many hours at the time as I was still in school. Just graduated and im looking for any type of work especially welding or general labourer
good,Handle client concerns. Develop highly skilled employees. Work on new technology and come up with solutions to the problems
good,for a retail company probably the best to work for.  The people are fun intelligent and help make it seem not so much like retail
good,Decent workplace with a good overall idea in the most part. Seems to be more of a money hungry business than potrayed to customers
good,"I learnt a lot, dealing with various clients, resolving various computer issues, mobile phones & networks."
good,I have always enjoyed working for the company. Good job security and benefits. Never had a single issue. Management is grant and employees are always in positive moods.
good,"Typical day at my specific store, come in and do your sales check-in, go onto the floor to contact customers and offer the highest level of customer service that we possibly can."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy my time at Best Buy. I've learned a lot and experienced both good and bad, but through it all I've upheld a level of standards that is considered world class guest service."
good,"I owned quality control by protecting both Geek Squad's and Best Buy's brand standards via consistent communication, coaching and validation of the processes.  Ensured the continued profitability and"
good,Work at Best Buy was very challenging but rewarding at the same time. Selling electronic items was the primary focus of the store I previously worked for. I learned how to be more organized with the CRW given to us. Management was understanding and cooperative to work with. My co-workers were hard workers and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the attitudes of customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the bonus of the month.
good,They are flexible and great management. I would recommend this job for people who are going to college good pay and great hours.
good,"Try to help customers with their needs/wants, clean department/down stock, and some other closing duties. Taught me how to be a better salesmen and a leader. The work environment is enjoyable and the managers are friendly."
good,Best Buy is a wonderful place to learn and grow.  I have gained priceless supervisory skills while being employed there as well as learned great customer service skills over the years.
good,"Job is very demanding with little reward and bonuses so you have to be ready, if you aren't sweating you aren't working is what i like to say."
good,"awesome place to work. I've gained a lot of customer service assisting customers finding what they wanted, or even more"
good,Working with the latest Audio and Video entertainment systems is fun and always changing. In a team of two there is a partnership in creating and working together towards a professional install.
good,"Best Buy is a great place for teens interested in technology to start, once you have enough resources to move on...do it!"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Best Buy as part of the mobile department. I engaged customers with questions about cell phone plans and devices and recommended to the customer based on their needs."
good,"A generic work day included me clocking in for and 8 and a half work day, which started with me organizing my clip board and making sure the floor was presentable in my department. The day consisted of me and fellow employees working with various customers that were mostly looking to buy a new home television since I worked in the Home Theatre department. A large part of the day was being  able to reach our percent sales numbers for our service warranties which can sometimes be a struggle. It was good to have these numbers as a goal to reach and it made sure work was getting accomplished efficiently."
good,It was a fun place to work because the managers were great and always helpful. It was always a team effort and pay was not too paid for a beginner cashier.
good,"A typical day at work for the first three hours was very routine and organized with waving, not-in's and calls needing to be completed before the next shift arrived. The latter 5 hours could be more liberal because of the fact that we were dealing with customers and stores from all over California at that point. Either way, our goal was to stay on task and help each customer feel comfortable with their order and fix whenever necessary. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with people everyday and feeling great to be able to help them. I also enjoyed learning new information and systems. The hardest part of the job was having to let down customer's by making them aware their product had not arrived as promised. I learned how to deal with difficult and ""explosive"" situations. I learned to always sound in charge and confident no matter what the issue. This upfront respectful attitude almost always gained person's trust, even if I had to disappoint trust was gained by being honest. The management worked closely with us at times when needed, but, mostly had their own operational tasks to manage."
good,"Great benefits and great work environment for everyone.great management and coworkers, benefit system is fair and compensation is too.many opportunities in many areas"
good,"Geek Squad/Best Buy is a great place to work when getting your feet wet in the working world. A typical day at work as a CA was productive, with a fair number of issues to allow for delightful challenges. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers and clients, as is the situation with most retail based jobs and selling services, and while it offered little in Benefits, Job Security, and any real advancement, it was great for experience, with exemplary management, and a fun Geek Culture to participate in."
good,First there would be a group meeting before the store opened to get us pumped for the day. Then we would do a walk through with the department and begin the day. We would take care of each customer that came in by having an open approach and asking open ended questions to find the complete solution before our customer leaves.
good,Great management team good place to work. great benefits. training was above par with the option to complete some training from home when necessary
good,"Honestly, one of the best jobs I've ever had. You learn a ton of stuff in a very fun way. You learn through computers, your peers, hands-on, etc. You're always up to date with technology and you get super awesome incentives while learning. Co-workers are a blast! You always will make life-long friendships here. Management is stern yet fun. Depending on the store, management is what makes you thrive on a daily basis."
good,"Working for Geek Squad is an interesting experience. Agents of the precinct are cut more or less of the same cloth as you. Much in common to build good relationships. An average day is always a crazy one. Dealing with a wide spectrum of clients that can at times push your patience and tolerance. Making the work day experience interesting. At times it can be challenging all around in general. Management, though not to familiar with the geek culture, are at times personable and relatable. The hardest part of the job is having soo much to do in a short amount of time with light coverage. The best part of the job are other agents, the repairs and the benefits."
good,Amazing place to work at if your co-workers are awesome and also your managers. Customers can be very rude sometimes for no reason but you just have to deal with it.
good,"Greeting Customers and providing legendary service"
good,"Working at Best Buy, you learn how the day to day business operations and how the customer is your number one priority. The whole store is to be seen as a team, working together to meet and satisfy the customer's needs. The point is to create a friendly atmosphere that customers can enjoy as well as the co-workers. Everyone is often friendly and can easily communicate with. The management staff is transparent, so any feedback you want is easily available. There is no grey area on the tasks needed to be done. The most enjoyable part of the job is you get to meet new people every day. The hardest part is having to deal with disgruntled customers."
good,"It was a fun job. it had its up and downs like any job does.  I was there for almost 13 years and I learned how to be a leader and to be more outgoing.  I am a huge people person and I was a leader all over the store and was able to handle issues and compliments on a daily basis.  Co workers were great its like a family environment.  It was hard at time dealing with issues at customer service especially the really mean clients, however I had a lot of regulars who always came in to see me and I loved it. I was done with the retail schedule and it was time for me to find something else.  I was respected in my job role and loved helping to develop others and best buy was great to allow the leadership to be able to do that.  I learned how to be more grown up, i did have some good leaders in my career and some not so good, I learned how I wanted to be and how I never wanted to be."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers. I m passionate about GREAT customer service and felt it was our duty to provide the best customer service to each individual who choose to shop at bestbuy.
good,"A typical day at work would be greeting every customer to make sure we help them in every possible way to leave the store happy. My job was typically on sales floor training so any down time i had i would have to find ways to train those that are not reaching their sales goal, weather it be role playing or explaining other ways to gain trust from a customer. I have learned so much working at Best Buy,from sales leading to gaining experience with being a supervisor. Around the holidays they made me into a key holder which gave me access to store alarm codes, back office information, etc. My coworkers were great there were some that brought energy down but feeding into that was something i hated being around. I think the best thing that i love about my job is that everyday was something different, weather it be solving a customer issue or just trying to get the customer out of the store feeling like they won. The hardest thing about my job was working retail hours, having to work every weekend was rough, not being able to spend as much time as I would like with my son."
good,It was a pretty ok job to work. It wasn't too hard. All the training was pretty cool because they have a level up system. I got to gold level and I was only a Seasonal Employee. Also the downside to the training is that it's a lot!
good,One of the more enjoyable jobs I've worked. Walking into work wasn't a regretful feeling. The management team were always coming up with new ways to motivate the employees to improve their sales performance.
good,"The job itself was easy to learn and do, being able to be cross-trained in different area's was always a plus. I learned how to multi-task by talking to customers on the phone, and face to face, while learning new computer systems. I really enjoyed taking care of the customers needs."
good,Fast paced company that allows for advancement. One of the most fulfilling jobs that I ever had. I really enjoyed meeting different people. I learned a lot while working for Best Buy.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I would go to clients homes and install,repair,and recommend electronics suchas Pcs,Tvs,surround sound systems,and networks."
good,"At Best Buy, everyday is a busy day so the day goes by very fast. One gets to meet many people throughout the day and those customers are always nice. I have learned a lot through my years at Best Buy and the most valuable thing I can say is, take your time, do not rush. The hardest part of the job may be the best and that's the customers. Most of them can be very nice to talk to but you will always get those other customers that you just can't please and that's just life."
good,"Great discount, fun atmosphere. Great pay. Decent hours. Meeting a lot of new people is great as well. Would work there again."
good,"Staying connected to today's electronics and technology has kept me sharp, and opened up life-long connections. Too much emphasis on the buddy system however."
good,I do not regret my last five years spent in a blue shirt inside a building without any windows. I can look back and see how much as an individual and as an employee I personally grew.
good,"Told to do different things by different people.  Nice work environment, low compensation.  Room for advancement if you're seeking it."
good,"Best Buy is a fun place to work, probably why I'm still there 3 and a half years later despite having a well-paying part time job. As long as you treat customers good and do what they ask of you then you'll have lots of down time. Very laid back atmosphere... lines can sometimes be blurred as to what's appropriate conversation and what's not."
good,"Assisting customers on making choices on purchases that best fit their needs. I was always learning about the latest phones and tec."
good,my store was a pretty good place to work learn and grow all at the same time. easy to learn everything. managers are fun and easy to talk to
good,"	I would greet customers and find out what they were looking for. I would help them narrow their choices according to their budget and space within their homes. I made suggestions according to the information they gave me and made sure that what we picked out fit their needs."
good,"The Management at Best Buy was a great team, they provided much knowledge in my time with them in the Electronics Retail. My coworkers were great."
good,I enjoy working at best buy. The reason I am looking for another job is because I recently had a baby and the hours (6pm-12am) are not to my liking. I would like to find something with 40 hours. I enjoy working with all of my co-workers and the management is great although there is often times a lack of communication within the AP department. I enjoy working with all different types of ethnicities.
good,"The Geek Squad offers a lot of opportunity to learn and grow as an individual, has many long term employees (10+ years), and management gets to know and care about the employees."
good,Enjoyed working at Best Buy. Got a chance to learn a lot about technology and see how fast this field advances. Out with the old in with the new. Fun place to work as a teenager. Great start into the customer service world.
good,"Best buy service center was overall a great place to come to work to, clean and well supplied,fast paced and fun. As a team lead I supervised a team of professionals and provided them with the proper tools and work flow on order to maintain productivity. There were weekly management meetings and weekly team meetings to pass on the information and metrics to team members."
good,"Best Buy is a great company to work for due to the benefits that come along as well. With being an employee, you get great discounts on merchandise and you also learn a monumental amount of information."
good,"A typical day would include talking to the customers about why they came to visit and helping them find what they need and want.  I learned how to ask probing questions to understand what the customer needs and how to be a good salesperson that did not push people into sales.  I got to help people get what they needed, but I also help some people get a new ""toy.""  My co-workers were a lot younger than me so at times a little difficult, but overall fun to work with.  The hardest part was the unstable schedule.  It was never the same and I did not like working on Sundays.  The most enjoyable part was being able to talk to and help customers."
good,"Assisting customers with mobile devices, as well as providing a great shopping experience throughout all of Best Buy."
good,arrive at 8 am and do my daily duties. Everything was good about that job i just needed more hours. Very good hearted people that work for that company.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,On a daily basis I kept my work area clean and provided quality customer service. I was a cashier and trained all new hires on the register. It was a fun place to work at but the opportunity for promotions where extremely difficult. Employees where not all treated equally (favoritism). The hardest part was not being able to meet a customers needs. The best part was having positive feedback from customers.
good,An amazing company to work for. The most enjoyable part is helping customers and meeting new people. Management is also great just would not like to work retail anymore
good,The people are what drive the overall feel of the store. It is a fun company to work for when the people are good. My day mainly involves fixing up the electronics so that are they functional for the customers to have a great experience in Best Buy. I have learned that you do have to change with time and learn from challenge and change. There will always be movement in the retail business and if you aren't on top of it you can lose yourself.
good,"I loved working for the company. Fun and exciting. Every morning during the morning meeting would discuss challenges in the store and company that identify success and areas of opportunity. Company allowed you to have your own individuality to separate yourself from the rest and a real chance to stand out among others. I felt like there was a great TEAM environment in which I got along with everyone. Open door policy that allows you to express any ideas and concerns. Allowed me to accommodate one of my passions which is meeting new people. If you love staying in touch with new technology in a fast pace, hands on environment. This would be an ideal job or career for you."
good,good job there is no complaints. this job has taken care of me the past few years. the discount is one of the cool factors in this company.
good,"Learned selling skills, customer service, answering phones, and many other aspects of business environment."
good,"Fun place to work, hard to advance and mediocre pay. I look forward to going to work, but I don't look forward to opening my bank statements."
good,Great place to work but not much advancement in the company.  Pay to start is low but management levels pay is high.  A lot of stores to choose from so transferring is easy.
good,"The non-commission atmosphere makes for some pretty laid-back coworkers. Even though you can make almost four times as much money working for Verizon or AT&T, I have enjoyed working in Best Buy Mobile."
good,"You must pick and choose what to learn from each employee, management can be difficult to find most of the times, coworkers at my specific store have issues with who is a better employee than others (conflicts occur everyday), hardest part of the job is a little bit of everything making the job not feel fun, most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work with the newest technology and learn while making the customers enjoy all of it as well."
good,"Would get to work and immediately begin to help customers find the right product that they desire. If I wasn't with a customer I would handle inventory and stocks, also inspected merchandise for quality and quantity."
good,Every day i go in and greet every customer that comes in. Not every customer is happy with service but that's when i use patience and understanding to help the customer. I try to help the customer save more money rather than spend a lot more than they need to.
good,"Fun workplace, with good range of age diversity.  Enjoy interaction with people and feeling appreciated by employees and management.  Team environment."
good,"Geek Squad's Repair facility in Brooks, Kentucky is a great place to grow and develop skills for anyone willing to put the effort and express interest. There are many functions at the facility which will allow room for growth. I would recommend to anyone looking to change career, develop management/business/technical skills or just a good company to work for while pursuing an education."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of learning new product knowledge on new technological devices. Being on the floor and engaging with all customers walking in to a wonderful work environment. Working in various departments throughout the store gaining new experience and knowledge by also gaining new friendships with colleagues. It was a great beginning for building a foundation as a sales consultant however, with the constant downsizing of department stores and the growth of whole sale internet companies created a  concern for job stability which was becoming more and more of an issue on a daily basis. All managers were great they were very personable and approachable they would regularly come up with team building exercises to help build positive moral throughout the store . The hardest part of the job would have to be the insecurity of your position or title at work. Throughout, my time with the company I have witnessed multiple departments being shut down and also individuals losing their position being demoted or let go because their title no longer exists with company job security was  a major concern also with the ability for growth within the company was very limited. The most enjoyable part was the work environment with your colleagues which became your friends and the amazing staff discount you receive as an employee was a great incentive working for the company."
good,Great atmosphere in the job. Lots of competitiveness to achieve sales goals. Sometimes one of the managers or surprises takes advantage of the new workers. Expect new employees know everything by day 2 on the job.
good,Selling computer and accessories to customers with best buy services. Improved my selling and communication skills. Credit Card Applications were important. Have to manage time wisely. Good team with a few ups and downs.
good,This is a really fun company to work for.  It is fast paced and offers some good benefits.  There are not a lot of options to progress in the company without going into store management.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I loved my time at Best Buy. The staff was excellent and there was always room for advancement and regular salary increases based on performance. I gained a lot of knowledge of the field that I was in when I worked there and I met a lot of great people. The biggest downside was when I had an illness in the family and specifically requested certain hours off to help take care of my family member and they acquiesced but did not follow through. It was as if they hadn't marked anything down and it got to a point where I was getting 25-30 hours per week but could only work a single 5-7 hour shift out of those hours. I would be scheduled during times I had requested off and when I'd say I could come in at 1pm for example instead of 10am, they would just say that it was okay and they didn't need me to come in that day, so I'd lose a lot of shifts."
good,"I learned how to deal with different customers. My typical day was assisting customers with retruns or excanges or just helping customers out on the sales floor trying to find the perfect item they were interesting in getting. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning about the latest trends dealing with computers, fitness watches,and the awesome 4k tvs. i got along easily with my co-workers if i ever had a issue or question i know i could go to them for help. Mangement there was pretty good they are all supportive and helped everybody on the sales floor. The hardest part of my job was at the beginning because it was difficult learning new things because it was very different but i caught on to everything pretty faster than i thought ."
good,"I was hired on via York Companies to work 2nd shift at the Best Buy Warehouse in Shepherdsville, KY during their peak 2014 holiday season.  "
good,enjoyed workinging withe the customers and meeeting different challanges and solving them
good,"Everyday I go to work. I try to stay positive. Keeping a strong head on your shoulders and feeling good at the end of the day makes you feel like your goals are being accomplished. "
good,I am not sure i was professionally mature enough to explore a lot of the benefits this company had to offer. I learned a lot about the retail world. learned a lot about the business model they had and how it set this company apart from other retail companies. the culture here was exciting. coming to work was fun every day and i enjoyed every second of it. It was fast paced and exciting. many opportunities for growth and to learn something new about the products and related skills. I saw many peers promoted so i know they promote from within and reward individual success.
good,"My job while at Best Buy was pretty rough. I started right at the time that the company was losing the Anderson company for managing the media. In one way this meant that the Inventory and Merch. team would have more responsibility, but on the other hand it gave me an opportunity to shine. As soon as I heard that someone was going to inherit that role I jumped at the chance to take on more responsibility and pick up more hours. I only had two weeks of training with the Anderson representative before it was completely my responsibility. I managed to do so well under the presser that I was asked to stay longer before leaving to San Fransisco. The constant schedule was: Sunday- Ad set, Monday- Plano, Tuesday- New Release, Wednesday- Pull-back and Returns, Thursday- Finalize Returns, Everyday Push inventory to the floor. "
good,Provided customer service for the customer’s needs or guide them to the proper area for their questions to be answered. Being able to multitask and work at a fast pace to keep customers happy and the area moving. Kept the front lane organized and in stock.
good,Company pillars are true foundation for the company's success.
good,"Assisting customers with any and every situation/issue."
good,"Most days at work i manage up to 35 people and give performance feedback and coaching to help drive a terrific sales culture.  I enjoy developing others and ensuring the customers get the best possible experience.  The hardest days are usually the busiest days, but the challenge of meeting customer needs and keeping employee morale positive is what drives me day in and day out."
good,"Its a thriving place to work, working there will keep you on the cutting edge to whats new in the technology industry.Operated cash register, Customer support, helping customers by addressing there needs, answered questions from and"
good,I learned a lot from my supervisors. Management were seasoned salesmen and this really reflected the stores performance.
good,Fun and laid back job as long as you put your work first. Most management is friendly.
good,"sell a lot"
good,"Everyday was a new day, a unique day.  You deal with a very diverse community and work with a very diverse group of people. Being in a leadership position the hardest part of the job is when something could not be done to satisfy a customer or even a fellow employee.  There are days the situation follows you home! Talk about a sleepless night.  When a customer or employee can be taken care of the best way possible, well, that made the day worth while. Solving problems, making ways to make the customer happy, whether it be by displaying new products or promoting a new sale is always a win.  Best Buy provides extensive training for every area of the store so you will not be left without knowledge and can help customers anywhere!  Managers and Supervisors are involved in each employees training and development."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"In the morning I'd print up our department's daily packet. After that I'd stock merchandise and make sure everything was clean and in it's place. Then I'd help customers with what they wanted and teach them about mobile phone devices, plans, etc. The management was always smiling and having a good time. They, as well as the employees would be ready to help out wherever it was needed. The hardest part of my job was having to write up employees. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to learn about upcoming phones and accessories."
good,"The management has been great, they seem to have fun while still maintaining a business. The pay is fair for a retail job and the benefits are nice."
good,"The retail experience of Best Buy is really good. A typical day at work consists of changing price tags, updating the kiosks and helping customer with the best customer service and giving them advice as to what product is best for them."
good,"professional experience"
good,Management team supportive of employees furthering education; flexible with student schedule
good,Plain and simple I enjoyed my job I hate the one I worked at closed down.
good,"Good place to work.  Lots of fun.  Some misdirection from the corporate site, but things seem to be getting better."
good,"A great place to work that's focused on being the best place to work, and the best place to shop."
good,"You typical day includes attending to customers, greeting and assisting them into the right product/solution that best fits their needs. There is a bit of politics when it comes to management but what job doesn't have politics. Coworkers can be awesome, again, depending on the team you are assigned. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with daily goals, depending on the traffic, it can get a little difficult if you are behind targets. But overall, very fun environment."
good,"Fun company to work for, changing industry is affecting stores though. Very good compensation, benefits, perks. Store teams struggle to find work life balance."
good,"Started each day by making the lunch break schedule and checking sales goals for the day. After that I would assign the other employees to their designated zones, and handle my zone and the customers in it. Periodically I would go through other zones and make sure that the other employees were doing okay. If there was an issue I would coach them on the correct way to handle the part of the sale that went askew. When it would hit the time for the an employee to take lunch I would notify them and then verify with a manager that it was okay for them to go. When it would get to the end of the day I would start stocking the floor and going through and lining the shelves (pulling the product forward). Then if I felt it necessary I would select people to send home and confirm it with the managers. Managers were great and fun to work with. They defiantly got to know you and form good work relationships. Even when I put in my two weeks I was pulled aside and offered a managers position to stay. I think that they were very good at their job and respected them a lot. My coworkers were very nice and listened well they never gave push back. Hardest part of the job was making sure that all sales were going well on account of I was always pulled to mobile or other areas to help for coverage, and since I was not able to be in my area I wasn't able to handle my over all duties. Most enjoyable was the morning meetings and other store meetings."
good,Sales driven culture of hard working individuals that strive to provide a world class retailing experience for every client.
good,Awesome place to show how well you can sell products to customers who want the latest and greatest.  Coworkers always helped eachother succeed by helping train and answer questions.  Enjoyable part was getting everything a customer needed and having them tell family and friends to shop there as well.
good,"Loved working for Best Buy, after several General managers, the latest one decided that he would let go of all current management staff. That part wasn't great but prior to that I was promoted twice in two years and had a fun and exciting day every time I came to work."
good,What I did in Best Buy Mobile was provide customers with an end to end experience.  I provide impartial advice to assist them in finding the correct solution and sell them the complete solution.  I also provide knowledge and training for other employees.
good,"This is the only place I've worked that offered medical benefits to part-time employees.  Management was organized and boosted morale.  I learned a great deal about all types of technology even outside of home theater, including computers and mobile technology.  Some of the coworkers were abrasive at times, but overall a good high-paced environment to work in."
good,"Culture is extreme here, Such a fun place to be employed! I have worked here for a year and it has been great"
good,"Best Buy is an amazing company. I've worked here for almost 8 years, and have grown heavily as a leader since the first day. Best Buy pushes its leaders to get the most out of them, and when you look back, will make you the best leader you can possibly be."
good,"I genuinely enjoy technology. It is something I get very passionate about. My position at Best Buy was a chance to use my knowledge of tech gadgets to connect people with devices they would be happy with. This was however my first retail position, so there were big adjustments to be made on my part. But I enjoyed making them because my supervisors were a joy to work with and were very helpful answering the many questions I had. The hardest part of this job was dealing with impatient customers, but being able to handle difficult customers was a skill I was glad to have gotten practice with as it can be very useful. By far though, the best part of this job was all of the fun tech gadgets I got to handle on a daily basis, it was very cool to get to handle brand new laptops, tablets, and phones almost as soon as they came out."
good,Most enjoyable part of the day is setting my own place. As long as the jobs get done buy saturday they do not care.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,ok place to work. Pay is not to brag over. The benefits are pretty good
good,"Management is not very fair, but employees are great to work with, but do not get paid enough for the job honestly."
good,"The environment was always driven around providing a happier workplace while driving results. In many cases, driving results provided incentives. The compensation is very competitive. In some stores however, they have built a culture which the sections of the stores seamed divided. The employees were mostly great people."
good,I loved working at Geek Squad City they were a very fun laid back company to work for
good,A typical day at work can be very enjoyable depending on the department you are assigned. During your shift there may be few customers and you must sell products to them including the insurance plan. The managers in my location were amazing people and I really enjoyed working with them. However if you don't sell to people (who usually come in to test out products before buying from another retailer) you won't get many hours.
good,They are going thought a drastic amount of change. Need to on you game here to succeed.
good,"Best Buy Vacaville was a great place to work, fun friendly environment, if you stay away from the co worker drama and focus on the customer experience you will enjoy it."
good,Typical day of work include talking to various customers to answer any questions they have on the product. Management is great to get along with and always try to help when there is an issue. Co-workers are friendly and dependable
good,Bets Buy has provided one of the best training programs that I have received on the job. Some of the training has also been excepted as college credits. The benefits including stock purchase plans and 401K have been very beneficial.
good,Worked as a team to find solutions for customers. Great environment to work.
good,"great work culture "
good,"During my time with the Geek Squad I had the opportunity to work hands on with computers and learn many different methods of troubleshooting and repairing issues. The hardest part of the job was staying informed on past, current, and future technologies which also ended up being the most enjoyable part of the job for me personally."
good,"This was a job that I got straight out high school and it taught me a lot of valuable work skills. how to talk to people, how to sell, even how to manage and lead a team."
good,"Great company to work for.  Seasonal in nature and some employees only work March through October at best. Learned a great deal of skills in a very short time that were very helpful in landing other jobs, Coworkers are fun and helpful. Hardest part of the job was being around the dust and heat in the summer but working outdoors is also the best part if you do not like the office environment. Customers love getting their product either at the yard or on the delivery end much satisfaction."
good,"We would start the day with exercising then would be told what department we would support,our home department or help stock or returns,or receiving . My home department I would fill orders for all Best Buy stores , and on-line orders.I learned how to read tickets,green bars ,upc # . Also learned how to know the location ,the bay ,the level bin . How to stock it ,how to pick , and some occasion how to send it back . "
good,"Its been a really nice learning curve for me working in best buy and i liked it."
good,"I had a great time at this place. Everyday was different and always presented with new challanges but everyone came together to solve all the issues. "
good,"Very energetic workplace everyday. Learned how to work well with others. Management is great, very friendly. Co-workers help one another and keep each other energized. Hardest part would be remember information about certain electronics and most enjoyable part was making the best of our shifts."
good,Decent store to work for. Helpful and knowledgeable associates who will help you every step of purchasing what you're looking for.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Working at Best Buy the team is more like a family. We all look out for each other and constantly uplift each other. There is always someone there willing to help you get the answers to what u need from management all the way down.
good,"Great job. Fun coworkers, Great benefits but a very high need to sell that must be met or you do not get hours."
good,"fun place to be, solid training program, income is pretty much par for the course"
good,"It is a great place to start out in a job, can move up quickly if you work hard enough."
good,"I would go into work and look forward to showcasing our new products to our customers. I learned a lot. In a warehouse setting and on the sales floor. Upselling was huge and a challenge that made the job more enjoyable. Management was usually very kind and fun to work with. After a while though you would figure out that they play favorites and it showed all throughout the warehouse. The hardest part of my job was dealing with unhappy customers, nut it was extremely rewarding to be able to assess their problem and figure out a way to make them satisfied with what we were offering in the long run."
good,"I learned a lot working in retail, warehouse and technology."
good,"Para mi esta empresa me dejó mucho en el como actuar como cliente, tanto como prestador de un servicio, al darme la oportunidad de sentirme agusto con mi trabajo, dandome retroalimentación y buscando mi mejora contínua, no solo dejarlo en una plática."
good,"Easy to work there, fun people, breaks were short but overall very well trained"
good,"Computer Software/Hardware repair."
good,"All about customer service and knowing what customers need. Managers are great or most stores have amazing managers, great coworkers, love the environment. Monthly bonus potential on team sales, would be better on indiviual sales."
good,This place was awesome. I had a lot of fun and had some good friends there. miss it.
good,You work in a results driven environment where multi tasking is not optional. Building relationships that cross all levels while supporting performance driven locations- over 15 with 75-100 employees at each location.
good,I was the supervisor of the merchandising and inventory team. My typical day consisted of making sure that my team of 15 people were setting up the store everyday. I would makes sure that our inventory trucks were unloaded and stocked onto the floor. I would make sure that all planograms were updated regularly and set properly. I would also make sure that our daily stock counts were completed. I was in charge of the store opening everyday. I also was in charge of making sure that the registers were counted and put on the floor every morning. I also was in charge of developing my team. I took care of my teams evaluations and any disciplinary actions. I worked with happy motivated people that made coming to work enjoyable. The hardest part of my job was managing my time to make sure that all of my daily duties were completed accurately and in a timely fashion. The most enjoyable part of my job was the feeling of accomplishment every day.
good,"The workers there are great. the customers not so much. the managers do their best to make work more fun, and are also flexible when it comes to accomodations."
good,"Constant, reliable job with great co-workers, but unfortunately where you start is where you'll end. There's no real chance for advancements or promotions."
good,"Having held many positions at Best Buy, my work day across them consisted mainly of checking my agenda of tasks for the day, making sure the department was clean or the right people were cleaning it and maintaining its appearance. Also making sure all the displays were functional and priced right. I was very happy with the massive library of information available at my finger tips be it trainings and learnings about store systems or product knowledge and I am someone who likes to know EVERYTHING about what I am in charge of. My coworkers were a mixed bag. Best Buy is a company ran by suits who employ kids/young adults so you get two out of every ten who really care and want to improve themselves, six who just want to hold a job and two more who don't care and needed party money. As a supervisor, it was my job to find out the motivation for each type of employee and get them individually to contribute to the success of the store. Hardest part of my job naturally are some of the customers and the issues they pose. When transactions go awry or product doesn't live up to customer expectation or just overall general unsatisfaction, finding ways to accommodate customers in their each unique situations can be a challenge sometimes. Probably the most enjoyable part of my job was when all employees were on the same page and the department was doing great, seeing the positive morale in action was always great to see. Also knowing how the employees views me as a leader and not a boss always pleased me"
good,"When I worked there, my daugther was very young. I worked various hours and missed out on important moments with her. The pay was great for what I was doing. There was plenty of room to grow within the company and management was very encouraging of that. My paticular store was very involved in the community which was fantastic."
good,"Great work environment."
good,"aunque mis tareas eran varias ya que estaba encargado de muchas areas dentro de la tienda siempre habia un ambiente relajado y mucha actitud por parte de la gerencia siempre impulsando a los trabajadores a ser mejores."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Typical day at work. Clock in at the point of sale system, catch up on things that I might need to know before other shift leaves. Then I am the teacher I figure out clients needs and hopefully to fulfil those needs. I do returns, exchanges, tax exempt, Point of sale, OMS which is Ordering management system, answer phone calls, transfer or direct in right department."
good,"I was hired as a seasonal employee and was very successful. We had sales goals to sell 3 credit cards per 3-4 hour shifts and I was selling way more and did not receive additional hours. Management would change schedule last minute and would not inform you, pay was okay. The job was kind of boring because it wasn't busy often, I quit before the season ended because my check did not cover gas expenses at the least, but before I left I started training for a different department, so there is room for growth but pay is the same."
good,"With the right team this job was very fun, as I was able to learn something new everyday. The nature of the work ensured an ever developing wealth of knowledge was constantly available. I then, in turn, poured out that knowledge to the customers to make sure that they understood what our services could do for them."
good,"Best Buy has seen its arc of influence diminish slightly over the last 2 years; however, the company provided outstanding training and support for its employees.  This is especially true for those who took ownership of the business they were entrusted with."
good,A fun place to work when attending school. Hard to advance up to management but possible if willing to relocate.
good,"Excellent work life balance"
good,"Well it was really nice only having to be up and at work by 10am. some morning really busy other really not, some mornings more than enough people working some mornings not so much, and it was busy and hard. I was the full time lead so a major part of my job was to coach and train those who were part-time in my department, that was five part-time and 2 full-time employees that were under my responsibility I made sure they stayed on task and answered any questions i could for them and made sure that issues went through me before getting to the managers. I really enjoyed be able to do that for my coworkers i always tried to make them the hero if possible but sometimes i had no other choice but to allow them to test the waters so to speak."
good,Best Buy has been my favorite job I've had. Works easy as long as you are friendly and not shy . Management there is great
good,The great thing about working for BestBuy was definitely the customers how really enjoyed learning about the new technology.
good,Best Buy provides a great opportunity to enhance the Employee and Customer Experience.
good,"Definitely a company that you get out what you put in to your time with the company. Through hard work, I specifically have been able to be a part of 8 different roles in my 8 year tenure. Ultimately leading to upper management and multi-unit roles."
good,"A typical day for me is like a scavenger hunt. I count product on a daily basics for inventory accountability and if I can not find it in the right spot. I look for it through out the store. I enjoy my job a lot because I keep the store's inventory correct."
good,Fits my interest as a sales consultant. Would recommend as a great starter job.
good,"I have learned a lot about technology working for Best Buy. You will always come home with new exciting information to tell. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was seeing the customers so excited about the new cell phones, televisions and video game systems."
good,"My typical workday consists of interacting with customers about our latest products, working with fellow employee's to get a sale out. Cleaning, and keep workstation in order, talking with customers on the latest films, and soundtracks. The hardest part of my job is being multi tasked when more than one customer need assistance, but I manage to get all the info, and sales transactions complete."
good,"Best buy is a great place to work. Everybody is friendly, management does well. The non commission aspect gives a good learning ground."
good,I loved my job for the 7 years I worked there a very good work environment. The only issue is when you had plans during the holidays you rarely could make them because retail is so busy.
good,Would train the employees daily around selling skills and how to close sales on the floor.  Assisting with the administrative paper work in the morning and also in the evening.  Daily role plays with employees around products and selling points.  Fun environment to work in and having fun creating contests and games to drive productivity and sales.  I loved working with the employees and training them to close sales.  Having a customer get excited about spending money at the store because they can't wait to go home and enjoy their new setup is a thrill I drive for.  The hardest part is the work life balance.  Working 50 plus hours a week at the store then coming home and working more and missing out on my kids and wife was hard to do.
good,"I worked in customer service learning how to solve customer problems in person and over the phone, financing, returns and exchanges, and order fulfillment. I made life time friends with my coworkers. Hardest part was the limited power we had in store to help customers. I would work here again."
good,"Best buy was a technology lovers paradise where people came to be filled with knowledge and leave with products to help meet there work or leisurely needs. Best buy offers excellent onsite training and also had fairly good management. The Best Buy I worked in had plenty of staffing and work seemed to go by so quickly with either helping customers with questions on computers or televisions, to stocking empty product spaces. I would highly recommend best buy as a place to work for anyone who likes being up to date technologically."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"great environment, safe environment ,team work ....best schedule flexibility.co workers..etc"
good,"It's great working with the latest and greatest technology on a every basis. You get a lot of support from management and store employees. I've learned so much from the company including network systems, home automation, and televisions repair. The hardest part of the job is the seasonal downtime in the spring and summer months."
good,Best Buy is challenging and ever changing.  I enjoy working there.
good,"Best Buy is a better than average retail company. The typical work day, when not in holiday season, is usually busy. The daily paper work, drop shipments coming in and deliveries going out making for steady work. "
good,"Working in Best Buy for me was an interesting thing. I learned a few things that really helped me out career wise and the atmosphere there was friendly. Not only did I learned a lot, but I also met great people there like my co-workers and my managers. Best Buy is really focused on customer service, and they wanted to give the employees the best training possible so they could achieve to be the best. The hardest part of the job I would have to say is the stress of having so many task to do and also deal with customers at the same time. I didn't mind as much because I can multitask, but it is very stressful. Other than that it's a very good job to work at and it teaches you so much every day."
good,"Best Buy has truly been a learning experience, everyday I've learned something new while in geek squad."
good,"I absolutely loved Best Buy! The people I worked with in the computer department were so nice and highly  intelligent and eager to help. It was always fun coming into work so much so that it didn't really feel like work. I, unfortunately, had to leave my store to go to school at MTSU full time."
good,"I started with Best Buy as a joke with my two boys.  I needed a part time job to work with my full time job and from there 9 years ago I have grown into the manager I am today.  A typical day of work was coaching/training associates, looking at gaps from the day before to see where I need to focus and with which associates.  Talking with customers to make sure they were getting the world class interaction that we set with all of my associates.  Every day was a different one, thus, each day had different tasks that needed to be done.  I learned how important time management was so that everything was completed with no excuses.  My co-workers were great and we always supported each other.  I have lots of energy and they would feed off of me when things were not going well for them.  The hardest part of the job along with the most enjoyable was when you trained your associates and their success took them to another store or even sometimes company from the valuable skill you helped them acquire."
good,"It can be an enjoyable place to work as long as you like working with customers and you don't butt heads with co-workers. I worked with several strong personalities and had my share of crazy customer experiences. Management can leave something to be desired, especially if you expect them to follow through on everything."
good,"Everyday is different and that's what makes it fun. I gained a passion for things such as high end audio and video which is something that I never cared about previously. I enjoy working with everyone there, because we all share a common thread of being kind of a nerd. The hardest part is certainly difficult customers who either don't want to learn or are just trying to get something for free. For me the most enjoyable part is when you get a customer who doesn't understand something and there is that moment where it clicks. The look on their face and gratitude they express is well worth any hassle from a lesser customer."
good,"Great company, great history, great culture, but struggling to remain relevant in the land of giants."
good,Would have stayed with this company had I not went back to school.
good,"Pulling reports and creating plans to execute against any underperforming metrics."
good,"A rewarding results orientated work place that allowed a lot of autonomy in my role. I was immediately involved in international meetings as Best Buy began its expansion into Europe and Asia."
good,Best buy was a fun company that worked really hard to make as fun as a work place possible. Job stability with in the B2B department was not there.
good,"Fellow employees are often friendly and create a very comfortable working enviroment."
good,"Good place to work. Good work culture. Friendly and warm atmosphere to work."
good,"Always something to do and learn. Meet interesting people. If you're at the right store, leadership is great! Pay could be better."
good,"Typically your average sales job.  Definitely push the solutions (Geek Squad and Credit Cards), employee discount was pretty good also, but pay was not bad also.  Depending on the location/store you work at, you'll find managers who'll want the best for you and some that could care less about you.  This location lacked charismatic leadership.  Depending on who you work with, your job could be awesome!"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"-receive shipment and ship out product"
good,"Easy going, energetic atmosphere. Feel productive"
good,"worked here for roughly 3 years, its a fun place to work but other than that nothing else. Management has been awesome in micro level."
good,"pretty nice place to work, loads of fun helpful people and little to no pressure, as long as you do your best to help the customer and complete DPA etc you can enjoy your time there, management are really easy to get along with a really helpful lovely people. All in all aside from the unsocial hours you can be made to work (including all bank holidays and sometimes christmas day) it's a nice enjoyable professional environment"
good,On a  normal day I can be found coaching employees and getting a better understanding of the business. The management staff is extremely helpful. They taught me to be a more proficient and responsible leader. My co-workers are a reliable and fun group of people to work with. The hardest part of the job comes when the holiday season arrives and the store isn't completely staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job is the everyday change of pace.
good,"Great place to work at. Like any job, it can get stressful every once in a while, but still, none the less, amazing place to work at. You have a family based feeling when working here. Your co-workers are great to get a long with. Everyone has their own responsibilities, but there is constant team work. The hardest part of the Job is probably when there is no traffic. When the store is completely dead and you're by yourself. But there is always something to keep  you busy."
good,"A typical day in the sales role would involve helping customers with their questions and creating a complete solution for them. "
good,A typical day consisted of helping customers until closing.
good,Amazing place to work and gain experience in sales. A day at work was go in and see how much your quota is and make sure to meet it or exceed it. Management was good no messing around but just gave empty promises of being promoted. Hardest part of the job was restocking the shelves. Most enjoyable part of the job was being the best salesman and getting to see the latest technology ahead of everyone.
good,"Fun, upbeat place to work. Best buy is a great company as a whole."
good,"I enjoy the people I work with; however, it seems management could use better guidance as to how to better lead their teams."
good,Best buy is a great place to work for. The pay is not the greatest but it really depends on the position you have. You just go in and help customers and restock on a daily basis.
good,"I started off as a cashier, selling replacement and service plans. I later moved to customer service and led the finance team. I helped customers with their needs and helped them sign up for credit within our store. It was a fun and great first job."
good,Great Place to work and learn about electronic retail. Also they showed you ways in working with customers and the installation process.
good,"I was responsible for customer returns and exchanges, I also processed credit card applications and large commercial transactions."
good,"I loved my coworkers, and most of the managers were awesome to work for."
good,"Its a great place to work, the management is exceptional, they understand and are willing to working with the flexibility of your schedule. the sales experience is great, only thing is the hours aren't consistent."
good,"Good working environment, learned valuable skills, Management staff was very easy to get along with."
good,"I love working for a company that actually cares about the employees and Best Buy has demonstrated this time and time again. It's not a career job for me because I just recently graduated from college, but I've made memories here that will last a lifetime. I'm grateful for everything they've done and continue to do."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"A typical day at work included a review of prior sales numbers and Sales goals for the day. Training with other employees and actually conducting those sales strategies. I learned a lot about many different types of electronic products and brands. The management was okay, some better than others, however some of the management knew nothing about the products in store. My co-workers were amazing people and friends, we all seemed like one huge family. I am still friends with some of my co-workers now. The hardest part of the job had to be dealing with the favoritism that went along with the ""job politics"" in the workplace. However I think what I enjoyed the most was the family feeling that I got every time I stepped into that building."
good,"walk in great customers help them buy the best product and try to help them use there electronics. co workers are great and hardworking, funny, and really care about the company. management does not know how to use half the items on store, will return any product past return date and will look to employee why our numbers are so low"
good,"The team is the best part but the customers... learned tons about sales, products, and teamwork."
good,"At Best Buy, my daily routine would start off with following a planogram and making sure my station would be up to par to what cooperate visually wanted in my work area.  I was a Multi-Channel Specialist which is means that I answered phone calls and made orders over the phone and in person in the store.  We were graded on the amount of time it took to answer the phone, how many sales were conducted over the phone, secret shoppers, how many dropped calls, how many orders were made in the store, and what we were able to help the customer out with.  In the store, I would often make orders for other departments throughout the store, while taking phone calls, and looking up products for other customers.  Many times I would make photocopies, send faxes to other stores and companies, as well as take messages for the managers and store manager.  I worked with many different co-workers at Best Buy from Home Theater specialist, to Geek Squad, to the Appliance department so I did learn a lot and met many intelligent people.  The hardest part of my job had to be when there were quite a few phone calls coming through the phone line and you did not want anyone waiting too long on the line.  I tried to as diligent as possible and get to everyone in a timely manner.  I learned that no matter what the customer is always right.  There were many of times where I did not agree with that statement but you as a employee you have to respect what people think and believe and hear them out."
good,I enjoy working at Best Buy a lot its a great place to work and help people
good,"The day is always filled with surprises, The customers are very pleasant and they enjoy the help and service we provide them with."
good,Would come in .pull my merchandise to be deliverd that day .Load my truck. Would do 10 to 15 deliveries a day.When I returned Iwould go on the computer and complet truck check in. Which was closing a delivery or rescheduling a delivery.Great co-workers. Really enjoyed my job. Hardest part of the job was working in the heat but you learn how to work in it'
good,"If you enjoy sales, Best Buy is a great place to work. Very fun, with being able to work with peers that are equally enthusiastic about their work."
good,"Best Buy Mexico, Se basa en una cultura de valores, donde buscan el talento de las personas donde estas se sientan cómodas y puedan explotar su potencial, manejando una cultura de enseñanza hasta lograra especializar al empleado, un ambiente laboral que lleva dos encuestas por año para saber que tan satisfecho esta el empleado con sus lideres y empresa."
good,Challenging environment; company supports movement across different areas within the organization.
good,A typical day at work consists of greeting customers and finding what they need.  I then direct them to the correct department.  I am also responsible for the stores security and preventing theft.
good,Working here is great for those that want to learn about new technology and have fun with people with like interests.  The great part about Best Buy is even part time employees can participate in buying Best Buy stock at a discount.  If you are into technology the discount the company offers employees is great and if you can get full-time they have an exceptional benefits package with tuition reimbursement on anything you want to take.
good,"In my experience with working for Best Buy, i would recommend this company to any and all High School and College students looking for a job that has decent pay with a great work environment. It is fun, intriguing, challenging, demanding, and allows for a good work / life balance outside of holiday season. "
good,"It's a job for college student with low pay if you don't care about the money. Lots of electronics systems to play with, but the pay is not just that great at all"
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work, especially if you love electronics and helping customers, no other retail company will go above and beyond like best buy dose for its customers. Co-workers are excellent as a team and the company has very high core values for its employees and its customers, the most enjoyable part of working with the company, is knowing that you helped out customers with an electronics solution that they loved and it changed there lives for the better, the hardest part of the job can be when your short on staff and dealing with difficult customers at the same time, it can be somewhat of difficult if you do not pace your self well. Management was great as well, always coaching team members to do better and show them how they can improve. Overall Best buy is a fun and great company to work for"
good,"Provide customers with current, and relevant information about the Home Theater System’s"
good,"As long as you do not pretend to know more than you do to a customer the days are easy. Management looks for hardworking people that can be depended on."
good,Set hours and set days. Set lunch breaks. Worked in and out of freezer. Dealt with cutting meat. Co workers and management was extremely helpful.
good,Good job to have while working in college or to have if you need a flexible schedule. The management team is good yet unless you know people there is not much room for advancement. The benefits are very good when it comes to insurance and the like. Associates are great and easy to get along with.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Typical retail hours. Enjoy the opportunity to work with latest technology.
good,"Fun place to work and every store has a feeling a family. The management teams are always great to work with. Pay and compensation are way to low for the hourly employees. Having a set schedule is impossible. However, this is a great place to work if you don't mind the random work hours and you want a fantastic discount."
good,"My entire shift was spent on my feet assisting a nearly constant flow of customers with their technology needs.  We worked closely as a sales team to best serve the public and advance the company as a whole.  My direct supervisor was a bit short with the team at times, but overall led us effectively.  I was trained for my position on the job, but wasn't bored to death with training for the first few weeks. They integrated it into the work day well, and combined training videos and tests with shadowing to achieve a balanced training program."
good,"A typical day would be to come in and turn on the demo products; if not already done so. Then to work your way around making sure everything is down stocked & organized for the ease of the customers. Approach any customers to offer help. Answer any questions they may have, if i couldn't answer the question personally I would make sure we got the answer for the customer; learning together. I would take some more of my online E-Learnings. Some where mandatory with a deadline, and others were for my personal learning and to push myself harder to move up in the company. I left early due to a death in the family resulting in me needing to be back in NC to help my mother."
good,"I worked with Best Buy for 3+ years and have enjoyed every second of it. The workplace was nurturing and catered to my lifestyle. I was able to balance work and school while working towards my BA in journalism and mass communication."
good,"Working in the Geek Squad doing returns, exchanges, checking customers in for service and helping create service tags is a lot of work you have to be fast and efficient at what you do while providing excellent customer service."
good,customer service helping people if they need help with something
good,"I enjoyed working here mostly because I'm hugely into electronics. Also, the staff is real friendly and i made good friends, the environment was very down to earth, and the management were very approachable. Only reason i left was because of college, but i truly enjoyed working here."
good,"My career at Best Buy has created and fostered many relationships, some that have turned into long lasting friendships. I even met my husband at one of the stores I worked in. Before working for the company, I always thought that BBY employees were very clique-y; in truth, many are. I feel as though I've found a place within the company that isn't centered around popularity the same way the stores are. Project Team is hard, but rewarding work. We have the Lunar (night) and Solar (day) teams. Each team does different tasks, but the end result is always making sure new products, vendor displays and new major projects (Microsoft & Samsung stores) are deployed properly and in a timely manner."
good,"On a typical day, I would be analyzing retail sales of my products in real time, comparing performance to competitors, conducting international conference calls with China, Canada and/or Mexico to figure out how to get electronics products from factory to stores at breathtakingly fast speeds, reviewing samples of new product ideas from top manufacturers around the world, presenting roadmaps and product concepts to buyers, developing packaging that would lure in customers, review inventory concerns and plan promotions online and in-store, and/or meeting with cross-functional teams of engineers, operations experts and sourcing experts to develop products. "
good,"Fun day is solving or answering customers questions and concerns on Mobile electronics and how it works best for them,"
good,"-good work hours"
good,"The only thing I didn't like about the job is how hard they pushed you too sell their black tie protection plans. For all the money they had us making them there should have been some sort of commission base. Other than that, the people I worked with were friendly and the company had a good spirit about things."
good,"My job is to contact customers, get to know them and under them, then sell them the correct item or items. I also handle customers issues, maintain and clean the department, and stock the department.  I have learned about different customer selling techniques that help out.  It allows me to be very flexible.  The management team is very friendly and helpful.  My co-workers all work as a team, help each other out, and very knowledgeable in our field.  The hardest part working at Best Buy is the flexibility of hours.  Its a little hard to have a personal life when the schedule from one week to the next changes.  It got better but still can be more refined.  I do enjoy the customers, employees, management, and benefits that Best Buy has."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Best Buy, it allowed a balance between work and home."
good,"enjoyed working here, very fast  paced ,physically demanding , good pay"
good,Best Buy Mobile was one of the best places I've worked for. This is due to the fact that I had a great team to work with as well as great management. This might not be the case company wide but it's a fast paced environment with plenty of room to grow and opportunities to keep up to date with technology.
good,"Fun and engaging atmosphere that instills a winning culture to the sales team. I've learned how to prefect product demos and master public speaking. The management does a great job paving the road to success, but sometimes our ordering system, OMS, gets in the way of normally smooth transactions. This can sometimes cause issues but by building a relationship with the customer, they generally are patient with the process. My favorite part of the job was interacting with people to provide world class service. Its gratifying to hear customers rave about your communication abilities, product knowledge, and listening skills."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"A really fast paced environment. Management overall knows what it's doing. Compensation/Benefits are amazing- IF you're full time which is difficult to get. The culture and values are ideal- they really care about the employees. Job security is fickle, you have to be good at what you're doing and it takes 2-3 years before you start moving up. Work and life are as balanced as you need it. "
good,"best buy is an ok place to work in. it gets a little stressful at times but overall with the co workers I have they keep me smiling and get me through the day. I learned a lot from this job. it has taught me to push further and accomplish more and how to be a leader in my department. a typical day at work for me would be helping customers return their items or help them find the right product they are looking for to do an exchange. Sometimes I answer phone calls, and other times I make appointments for  the customers to see a geek squad agent. "
good,"Great time working for the company, learned alot about management and how to work with clients and take care of their needs. Learned to train employees and work with big groups of people to all achieve a positive growth"
good,Fast pace job . With technology changing best buy educated you on products so that you would be knowledgeable.
good,This company is constantly striving to improve by raising the standard of accomplishment in the workplace.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of running the business, managing my team, ensuring every customer received a world class customer experience. I learned how to manage my time & how to write a business plan. The people I worked with were great most of the time. The hardest part of the job I would say would be working long hours and the most enjoyable part of the job would probably be the benefits."
good,"Typical day at work for me if purely administrative functions. I work management and other leadership to perform my daily tasks. This includes processing paperwork, and verifying that any and all stock stock product is being properly shipped and received and fully function once repairs have been made"
good,"Great place to work. Sometimes days were slow and less customers, so means less work, which made those days somewhat boring."
good,"great part time job great discounts and nice environment, flexible schedule"
good,"Provide services to customers who were looking to set up a cell phone plan and who were looking for a cell phone, learned a lot about the business of sales and how to get people the best plan avaiable. The hardest part of the job was their inablity to keep their promise about hours and pay and at times co-workers would not show up so I would have to work a double and then go to my other job."
good,"The hours are long, you rarely get a 10 minute break even though it's part of the agreement, your half hour lunch goes flying by. Weekends are the worst because you get bombarded with people & you have to know so much... But over-all it was a great first job. I learned so much... My management was great for the most part. Thumbs up. Definitely not for everyone though."
good,I earned my sales stripes and learned the ropes working at Best Buy. I recommend that anyone looking to get into a retail sales career work at Best Buy. The environment is great and though their primary goal is sales their secondary goal is developing the people who make those sales possible and that results in career growth as long as you make the commitment.
good,Very busy on weekends and not so busy during the down times on the weekdays. I learned a lot on how to sell and pitch as a salesman. The hardest part of the job would be asking the customers a full line of step by step questions that must be followed through for good quality customer sales. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the events that we would do after work nights. The co-workers are very lively individuals. The management is very strict and friendly at the same time. The supervisors and managers are helpful.
good,"Had fun while being the best. make lots of friends, enjoy customers, the schedule will wear you out though."
good,"Great job, loved who I worked with. However it is difficult to advance in this company."
good,"Working for Best Buy is fun. It is a great enviornment, they participate in events outside of work such as participating in the Susan B. Komen Breast Cancer Walk, The SPCA walk, and other events. The hardest part is completing all of the e-learnings by the deadline. Management implemented time consuming programs. I learned alot about the products Best Buy sell and how theyare used."
good,"Co-workers are attentive and helpful, help make work more fun. works with much customer service and this is how you want us to help them do unto you."
good,"Typical day at work includes shipping and receiving products, unloading trucks that carried product to the store, sending off service items, working with great co-workers and managers, i enjoy not being micro-managed"
good,Best buy was a good temporary job but advancement really wasnt there.
good,"Customers come first and foremost. They are not always right, but finding a solution is at the center of everything they try to do."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy has a very high energy atmosphere. Days are very full in terms for dealing with customers and store responsibilities. Staff and management are very friendly and caring , it promoted a positive work environment. Working with computers is my passion, so it was a good paradigm for me. The only downside I can think of is that it was retail and with that comes down time when I gets slow."
good,"I've enjoyed my time at Geek Squad and have learned a great deal. Every day involves working on computers and helping people out, and the team has a good time doing it. Personally, being surrounded by computers all day at work motivates me to learn even more at home. Computers went from being a hobby, to all I think about. I'm very fortunate to meet the people I have along the way to bounce ideas off of and figure things out together."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work for and a great place to get on your resume. Their sales tactics are not terrible, and you are not paid by the amount of sales you have. The positions are hourly."
good,"worked f/t & p/t.accomadated time when p/t.couldn't keep both jobs.asked to work for when Manager controlled hours,but then contolled by corporate."
good,BBY is a great place to work as you will be challanged every day to learn and grow.
good,"In a typical day, I arrive at work to get a quick briefing from the person just leaving. There are many different computers or other electronics just lying around that I don't get told about only to find out later that was left for a manager to deal with it. There is not much growth possibilities in this job. This is targeted to be a stepping stone type of job while still in college. The GM is given a wide area of work room so depending on who you work under the work place can be very strict like my store or very laid back like the store was when I first got hired. Probably the best part about my job is always keeping on top of the newest electronics that are coming out."
good,"I worked in the ""Home Theatre"" department as a sales associate. I helped customer choose the right equipment for the ultimate experience that mattered to them. I also cleaned the department, handled cash registers, down stocked and acted as a senior to younger and newer staff. Management and co-workers were excellent. They motivated me to do my best work and helped if it was needed. The hardest part of the job was when we had low staff in our department and it would get busy. handling 3-4 customers at the same time with different needs would be a challange, however something that i liked doing."
good,"I would act as a warehouse manager. I would receive stock, handle invoices, delivering furniture and organize the warehouse. I also assembled furniture in the show rooms and helped customers. I learned how to multi task, meet customer needs and deliver excellent customer service. Management and co-workers were helpful, and did not come in my way with any issues. The toughest part of the job was to have all my duties organized in a timely manner, seeing how i was controlling more things at once. Deliveries being delivered to customers houses on time was my goal, where I needed to plan ahead in order to meet the set goals. I enjoyed doing different things at work and not only deliver products. Change of scenery was a plus."
good,my days were kept busy learning different task.
good,"Best Buy is a cool place to work for. There's a great atmosphere, and some wonderful, friendly people there as well."
good,"Everyone on the same level as me ,and even most of my managers, were great to work with and it was fun for a ""retail job"". I learned a lot about technology and we all worked as a team. I was even offered for them to pay for some of my college once i worked there long enough."
good,"I unloaded the truck, organized the products into different sections (laptops, games, TV's, Home Theatre). Provided help for the customers through product knowledge. This job made me realize that being in sales or customer service was my future. I got over my stutter and was very happy helping people out. My managers were cool, since we worked in the warehouse they would buy us refreshments and even helped us move merchandise. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck, the most enjoyable part was getting the work done."
good,"-A typical day of work consists of first a morning meeting, then I would gather my days jobs, make sure all appropriate paperwork is in order, call the days clients, proceed to each location to complete installation while keeping record the entire time, keeping a proffessional image, and demonstrating safe work practices."
good,"Working for Best Buy has been a great experience thus far, a typical work day is crazy fun and busy. I've learned how to be a better team player and I've learned so much more a bout electronics and the way that they function. The management and my co-workers for the most part have been very personable and fair when it comes to working. The managers make sure that those that perform best on the job get the most hours and that everyone is treated fairly based on their drive and work ethic. The hardest part of the job is probably having to train someone who knows very little and doesn't want to learn; someone that's really just there for the money. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers, sometimes they can get a little out of hand and come off extremely rude, but seeing an angry customer leave happy because you did all that you could to help them, even if it didn't work, is a great feeling and it makes you feel even better to know that they genuinely appreciate your services and hard work."
good,The work was great and the job was fun. Meeting new people everyday and help so many people was great. But management always talking about firing the employees openly isn't smart and healthy for the work environment
good,"A fast paced atmosphere with a great amount of technology. Never a dull moment with customers, replenishing product, and providing outstanding customer service. Managers work with you to help you balance your job and school. They work with you to get you all the training you need."
good,"good bonuses, customer service based, nice team to work with"
good,"Best Buy is an awesome place to work, great benefits for associates. I have learned a lot from Best Buy, how to teach fellow associates and how to engage customers. Working in retail has helped me mature and grow through out my life."
good,"From the ground level, the expectations are set as to the day to day goals and experience that should be received by each employee and how that experience is translated to the consumer. The core values of the company are solid but any chink in the management armor could alter that experience for both the associates and the clients."
good,"If you love interacting with people then this is a great job. Work-life balance of the retail field is a major downfall, however if that isn't a big deal then definitely take a look at Best Buy!"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Company is always there when you need them. great training.. pay not so great :(
good,"Best Buy is fast paced and when there is down time there is always a lot of things that need to be done. I enjoy my job, especially being able to help people find what they need to make their work and school life easier. I've learned how to patient and respectful with even the most difficult customers. My general manager has so much integrity and is one of the most inspirational people that I have ever met."
good,"Love working here, managers are kool and very good at there job"
good,customer service
good,"Love working with my fellow associates. But with the instability of the company, the feeling of moving on is very stron"
good,"I am the lead repair tech at my Best Buy. A typical day of work involves fixing a plethora of computer issues and calling clients to let them know the status of their computers. I have learned how to repair just about any computer issues on Mac or Windows OS and how to recognize hardware issues on-the-fly when I see how the computer responds. Management is great, as long as you do your job they treat you right. Co-workers in the repair area are a great bunch, fun times and hard workers. I find difficulty explaining the 'hard' aspect of my job as most of it has become routine although sometimes I do run across a challenge or client that can be difficult to overcome. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of completing and clearing the client computers from the queue. The fewer computers there are on the bench, the happier the clients are."
good,I enjoyed helping people pick out their new phones and plans to meet their needs. You can build great rapport considering you can be with a customer for an hour or longer.
good,I learned so many things at Best Buy and was up to date on the newest technology!
good,"Being an employee at Best Buy has given me the skills I need to work and grow our ever-changing society. From business relations to technical services Best Buy offers a multitude of fields anyone can purse, as long as you have the drive and conviction to purse such a field. It is not something you are given - you must prove yourself nearly everyday to achieve your goals."
good,Management seemed to lose focus on caring for their employees and even customers and got far to consumed by numbers.
good,"My typical day consisted of learning new things about merchandise, meetings, and selling what i knew. Ive learned that you have to know exactly what your talking about when selling products to people, if you don't know certain information, hand the sell off to a co-worker. if you sale merchandise to a customer and you give them wrong information about the merchandise then that can be really bad on your part. The most enjoyable part of this job, is when I can sale a customer something that I know is worth their money and they will like. The hardest part of my job is selling the majorly expensive stuff. like washers and dryers, best way to sell, is to tell your customer, "" we price match with any where!""."
good,"my first week work at best buy my login didn't work , so i had to stand beside a coworker for shadowing and it was a not busy week."
good,interacting with customers was always fun. it was always a new experience to meet new people and learn more about their lifestyles and families.
good,"Best buy was a great company to work for. The people were awsome, they treated me fairly for the most part."
good,Most enjoyable part of my job was the smile on their face as they left the store & knowing I help them with their purchase.
good,bby was a good company I learnt a lot about management and the team was great most days I will get in at about 10am and leave at 10pm.Recruit coach and train employees. deal with customer and employee issues.
good,"Great job and Great company if you can ""perform""..."
good,"Great experience, learned many new technologies as they came out."
good,I liked working alongside the managers and team members. It was a great work atmosphere.
good,"Working at Best Buy is a good learning experience for anyone who hasn't been in the retail side of a career. They teach you everything you need to know and are fun people to be around. Managers are constantly interacting with everyone else, so there is no sense of any ""caste"" system."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best buys a cool place to work for a part-time position.They work around your school schedule as long as you have decent hours available. A typical day at best buy is generally assisting customers. The most difficult part of the the job is the moments when there are no customers and leaderships expects you to stay busy. Overall a cool place to work, alot of electronics to play with and as long as the customer aren't being jerks and your producing and making sales there shouldn't be any problems"
good,A typical day at work woulld be offering the Best Buy Card and presenting what products we have to offer.
good,Great company to work for. Has given me multiple growth opportunities. Love the people I work with. great team enviroment.
good,"A typical day was fun, mainly because I liked interacting with my co-workers and customers."
good,"Best Buy is an amazing company that develops young people to become responsible leaders with strong ethical work values. They build on your existing drive for success and further your career as far as you would like to go. My typical day at work centers around the customer and my team. I lead a team of eight associates and drive the daily business by maximizing profit and goals. I also generate reports and maintain back in processes and reporting. I daily work with Excel, Powerpoint, Word, Outlook and Adobe. I have experience with Adobe Photoshop as well as OneNote."
good,"Stock, sell and flex games, cd's and dvd's. Provide customer service throughout store."
good,Did not love the lack of available hours. One week you get almost full time hours and the next week you're down to less than part time. Sometimes they'd even call associates and ask them not to come in for their scheduled shift. I've come to find out that it's all a matter of managements. Some managers take care of their associates others take care of their wallets.
good,"The store is full of the latest gadgets and other top of the line electronic products. Very fast paced and knowledge demanding in all areas. People of many cultures, beliefes and races work in Best Buy and so do the customers. Managers could pay a little more attention the floor workers but overall it is a nice co. to work with."
good,"Generally speaking, there are a lot of great people to work with. A majority of the employees are excited to be there everyday. The management team, as a whole, needs improvement, but that is to be expected with the recent changes that have taken place. Nothing about the job itself is difficult. My favorite part about my job...is being able to relate to over half of the employees. I've made a handful of true friends in the few months I have worked there."
good,Have to be friendly and calm to help frustrated customers with their computer related problems
good,"I worked for Best Buy part-time and it was a fun place to work. I learned how to hone my selling skills, close sales, provide continued great customer service. The hardest part about the job was moving up in the company. The most enjoyable parts of the job was assisting customers with home theater system solutions, learning new product and being able to share how they can enhance the home theater experience."
good,"A typical day for me while I was employed at Best Buy was first, checking the daily planner to not only see what my shift was and what my responsibilities were but to also see what my departments responsibilities were. I have learned a great deal from working at Best Buy but one of the most valuable things that I can draw from my time is the quality of my public speaking skills. I have overcome my fear of getting up in front of small groups of people and pretty much being the center of attention. My co-workers are what made my day fun and very challenging. I was used to games of who was to raise the most income for our department that day or who was going to sell the next of a particular item and if I were to lose, then I would have to compensate either the team or that person. These types of games were very fun and made the work interesting. The hardest part about this job was leaving such great people behind to pursue other career opportunities."
good,- Training is a big part of the company and I learned a lot about each product we sold.
good,"Best Buy as a business was instrumental in building me as a consistent leader. I was lucky enough to have multiple GM's and store managers that developed me to understand trends in KPI's, how to develop a business, and performance manage your line level associates."
good,"I've worked at a few stores, and the difference depends on the organization of management. The vibe between employee's is fun, and so is engaging with customers. The hardest part of the job was communication with certain employee's specially when you're assigned to supervise them despite not having the title."
good,- A typical day at work I had set goals to reach by the end of each work day
good,"Good place to work at. Fast paced, good management, & decent pay. Feels like a big family/team. You get to stay up to date on consumer electronics."
good,Fun place to work. Good people to work with. How to deal with people. Hardest part of the job not enough good workers. The most enjoyable part of the day was the end of the day to see what we accomplished as a team.
good,very high turn over makes getting to know bosses and co-workers very hard.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I worked here when I was young and in college. It had flexible hours that allowed me to balance school with work. I loved the managemnt at my store. It gave standard breaks and gave chances to improve the store.
good,A lot of interaction with different levels management. Hardest part was participating in a physical inventory count that required non-standard working hours.
good,"During a day at work, it can only be described as 'fun.' Co-workers learned to communicate between departments efficiently and discords between employees are easily fixed. The hardest part of the job is the constant shift changes which is set to fit everybody's schedule."
good,Always things going on and customers needing help. Managers made being there enjoyable.
good,"A typical day at Best Buy was a fast paced working environment. I learned that in that field, one must have the utmost patience, tolerance, and proper work etiquette. My co-workers within my department were awesome. We connected well, and built within our department, which made everyone comfortable; Both customers, and employees. The hardest part of the job may have been when a lot of traffic was flowing in the store, and employees that worked in the warehouse weren't available. The most enjoyable part of the job was when the General Manager of the store interacted with the employees. It showed us that she cared about her employees, which made it a fun filled environment."
good,During my 25 years I seen this company grow. I learned a great deal about Supply Chain and Inventory Control.
good,I loved working at best buy... It was a fun environment and the people were amazing... I will explain in interview why I no longer work there...
good,When first starting here it was very pleasant. Its still nice but with the new management the atmosphere is totally different.
good,help in bills and great place to work. friendly staff members and growth within the job its self.
good,"Best Buy is a fun place to work for college students that are in need of a flexible work environment. While most of the work is repetitive, it is really rewarding if you are looking to advance yourself. The hardest part of the job is the customers."
good,Good workplace with good benefits and an good work environment
good,Best buy is an excellent company to work for and I would continue working there if it meant more pay and hours.
good,Best buy is a great place to start a career and learn from those who have build a great company. It has a solid foundation to build upon and does its best to provide an ideal working environment for its employees.
good,If you are into electronics this is the job for you. You nust posess customer service skills and product knowledge.
good,"Working in the warehouse at Best Buy tends to be a fun, fast paced job. The beginning pay is relatively low, but it's not a high stress work environment."
good,"While the work is nice and fulfilling, at the end of the day, all you have are your accomplishments. The likelihood of making advancements in the company is extremely thin"
good,"Good environment to be in, very competitive, benefits were great."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.

good,"I had a great time working at Best Buy Milton, It allowed me to learn more about how to communicate with customers as well as set a standard of value from the teamwork I have been exposed to."
good,"I personally liked working there. I was just seasonal and I was sad when my applications to stay on were passed over for others(some of which I believe quit)  but overall I enjoyed being around my coworkers and manager. My supervisors were wonderful as well. We're at a weird location so sometimes it gets really dead and quiet but its easy to keep busy. Overall, it was a good experience for me."
good,Job work life balance was very good close to home not overwork. Company has great benefits. Job security was not a problem. Management was helpful and very easy to get along with. Job culture was very with relaxed atmosphere.
good,Best Buy creates a great environment that makes all employees regardless of background feel welcome and provides them opportunities to build a career.
good,"They're a good company to work for. There is no commission-based pay and the benefits are decent. Would I work there again? Probably not. However, they have a good culture there and if you're into electronics, that can help you explain products better to customers."
good,I was called the N word by a trainer and the Human Resources did not respond for about 8 days. I left for this reason. I felt quite disrespected in the situation so I had to make a choice since matters were not addressed.
good,Best Buy has great company culture and values and I really like that it is a team environment people want to see you succeed and there is always something new to learn
good,For warehouse its a lacks easy-going part of the job good people to work with good environment to have friends in best part is the employee discounts.
good,"Fun place to work, but leadership rolls are very serious and will mean a lot of long hours and lots of patience. Line level work (sales consultant) was a blast!"
good,The benefits that are integrated into employment and the training. The amount of new things that you can benefit from and the variety of people you work with.
good,decent place to work my managment kinda went downhill in the end but it varies place to place. Overall the worked with me when i was in college and that was a large benefit.
good,Best Buy was hands down one of the best company’s to work. Flexible schedules energized managers and you always get off on time. It’s easy and you get to talk about tech all day long!
good,"Have sales goals each month. They change with the market every month. Product knowledge and customer service are key to being successful. If you are not customer oriented you will not succeed. Listening to what the customer wants and needs and then meeting their expectations can be challenging, especially if their expectations are high."
good,"If you are part time they will not let you know when they drop you from 30-40 hrs to the next week being 10hrs. Until your full time, you never know what your hours will be each week"
good,"A great place to work overall. Great people and advancement opportunities."
good,The people you work with and the fun you have will your at work. You learn something new each and every single day. Well always held customer to the highest standards and guided them through there shopping experience.

good,"The employee discount is good and the payment is good as well."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I have been with Best Buy for over 6 years now and for the most part it is very enjoyable. Management generally tries to get you on a steady schedule so you can try and plan around that for friends/activities. I have learned quite a bit while working at this company from tech support, to scheduling, dealing with upset customers, how to work a truck and properly stock a store and so on. Call outs are never a problem as I have never needed to bring a doctors note once. Management is very trusting of their employees and treat everyone with respect. My least favorite thing about this job is pushing credit cards and Total Tech Support programs. Its like a broken record day in and day out, but that is the downfall in working retail, always pressured to sell some sort of a package or deal. What I enjoy most about working at Best Buy are the people. We have fun and joke around everyday and it makes coming to work quite enjoyable."
good,"good work environment but looking for full time work not part time ,fast paced through holiday, planogram execution , inventory management, shipping and receiving"
good,"Can make a significant impact and still not see opportunities open for yourself. Hard to differentiate yourself in a large corporate environment, though Best Buy likely does not have a monopoly on that."
good,I have no opinion that I want posted on here. I dont know why this is required for me to look for a job. This is a position through a temp agency so I have no real grasp of actually working for this company
good,"i cant complain. its great but sometimes politics come into play but mostly fair to the employees. I've learned a lot, I've grown as a person but it comes at a price. you have to work hard and many people are friends with management that get the first pick. the interview process is fair but sometimes its per determined but they have to go thru the formalities or the company will get in trouble but that is a secret."
good,Management is always there to help you frow and support you. You not only learn about the multitude of products that the store carries but also conflict resolution and ways to improve customer experiences in the store.
good,It was a transition to work overnight but I enjoyed working with my team. The team were split up in different departments to clean and update prices if necessary.
good,I enjoyed Best buy although it was a shame they couldn't offer full time work. The management i feel like didn't understand fully the inventory job so it was difficult when the inventory supervisor position was empty. Once filled made things flow much smoother
good,"I like working for this company, it's  a great one to work for. My co-workers and managers are super supportive and helpful. I've learned alot of things from here."
good,"Very great place to work at. The management expects excellence thus is it required from employees to do their best. Moreover, the pay is great thus it is a great opportunity"
good,"If your partime, don't expect great hours. Management is definitely a priority for me, and it showed over where i was at. Not the greatest area but that is just my own experience."
good,Awesome management a lot of good teammates solid pay. You do have to work holidays but they compensate for that day very well. Christmas time your life does get taken from you for mandatory overtime.
good,"I believe Best Buy is a GREAT place to work if you’re in retail. My time there was great, I loved the culture, and people I worked with. It was a lot of fun. Pay could have been better, and sometimes favoritism played a role in promotions.. but that aside this job was awesome. I learned a lot most days, which was rad. If you’re looking for a good retail job, check it out for sure."
good,This job was fun and a great experience. You will get a lot of different technical issues to resolve daily. The pay could be more but overall a great experience for an entry level tech support position.
good,"I was fortunate enough to work with hard working and fun co-workers, which definitely enhanced the experience and motivation that I had with the job. On some of the more rough days, which there are plenty of, having co-workers there to help pick you back up is what made me excited to work at this job."
good,"Overall Best Buy is a good work environment, the Best Buy team has the best people to work with, but they can be unorganized when it gets busy the system with store pickup and shipments could use some work"
good,"A very fast passed work environment with lax managers and fun co-workers."
good,I did enjoy being able to meet all sorts of different people and communicating with them. it was always heart warming being able to successfully help someone out.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I felt like I was back at school, there is some healthy stress because of work, but environment is very friendly. It was a great time for me in there."
good,"A typical day for me goes as is, picking online orders throughout the day, carrying out any product needed from customers. Helping customer service/sale floors out when needed. Finding product for employees/customers that can't find it. Down stocking on certain days of the week."
good,I enjoyed working as a student in high school because it was a low stress job paying minimum wadge. There was room to grow within the company. However electronics have never been my passion.
good,working at bestbuy is fun and also hard work at time with my job on the delivery truck. There are also a lot of training programs you can take part in at any time
good,Good company and they care about their employees. Been through 3 CEOs and all have put lots of time and effort into the company. Many happy employees working here.
good,It wasn't a terrible place to work at that's for sure but they do obsess over customer contact to a point where I feel downright aggressive. My co-workers were amazing open minded folk (most of the time). But the management could be a bit much and it was annoying at best most of the time.
good,The atmosphere is great. Fellow employees are wonderful. Management believes in and support all employees growth within the company. Great company to work for
good,"I am a full time employee in the Home Theatre department. My responsibilities are to create a welcoming and helpful experience for all customers. Walking step by step figuring out customer needs and what it is they’re trying to accomplish. While, holding excellent customer service and maintaining patience."
good,"Best Buy is a fun job, but for the right person. My team and leaders are amazing and very supportive. But the job very quickly becomes very tiresome in the fact that i know i'm capable of much more than what i do at work."
good,It was a good place to work for. Work hours are from 6am to 4pm. Lunch breaks are 30 minutes and you get your 10 minute breaks. You get really good discounts and benefits.
good,I quite enjoy working at best buy. The training they provide is good and pretty easy to learn everything quickly. It is not competitive at all when it comes to selling as no one makes commission.
good,Good place to work especially if you like technology. Hours can be relatively flexible although outside of the busier months your hours could drop drastically if you are not a full time employee.
good,A group of forward thinkers on a stop at best buy. I believe best buy can be a great home or even stepping stone to greater goals and ideas for ones future.
good,"Dealing with customers can be annoying at times, but on most occasions the job consists of teaching customers about the possibilities available with modern technology and how it can benefit them. Coworkers and management tend to be very friendly and create a great work environment."
good,The work are best buy was not too hard to learn and the training was very well done I was able to carry a lot of that knowledge and was a great way to put my foot in the door
good,great part time job if you love electronics. The staff are great to work and the work events are pretty good. they also set up activity nights for the worker to enjoy.
good,Hours and times are excellent. Working early morning and be out by noon.employess are very friendly and they are knowledgeable of products and services.
good,"Great work place"
good,Fun to work for but cooperate is starting to put investors first and it is showing that the only thing that is important is saving a little to hurt a lot of important process's in the stores.
good,"The work is easy and the people there are great! The management will take the time to help you out whenever they can, you can always count that this is one of the great working environments"

good,"If you can find work at a store that embraces the Best Buy (BBY) culture at it's heart, you'll work there for a lot longer than one might think. My first time working for BBY, I noticedi felt overvalued in my position, but this was wonderful, because for "
good,Typical work day includes helping customers find correct items and answering questions they have about specific items. It also includes stocking and restocking items and Merch back in designated area.
good,"If your the type of person that goes in 110% this would be a good place for you  there many chances for you to move up in the company, as long as your trying!"
good,"It was a fun place to work for, never a dull moment. There is constant up to date training so you always feel like you know what you’re talking about."
good,"Flexible with your life situations, great job to work and the skills needed is to help the customers with the best products. I've grown to know a lot about not just computers but about all appliances and technology.. The work is easy if you apply yourself. And I'm a very outspoken person that also helped with when dealing with difficult customers.."
good,"Good place to work if you're interested in technology. The staff is friendly. I was responsible for preparing items for customer pickup, moving large appliances for customer delivery, and unloading several merchandise trucks each week."
good,"It was a good experience, everything gets hard until you get used to it except 7-10 hours if you want full time fill free just have a great work ethic"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Best Buy! It was very informative working there and I learned something new about the technology we sold every single day. The only con I would say is that the store I worked in really pushed to sell the credit card to customers, which in the area of town I worked in, wasn't very easy."
good,"Really awesome people to work with, just like a family. Really wish it had been commission and hourly pay. Wish that the overall hours of the job were better."
good,"Had lots of fun working here and acquiring skills of being a salesperson, working the register, and trying to reach sales goals. Great opportunity to get an understanding of how retail jobs work."
good,"I loved my job at Best Buy, But wasn't in love with it. I went for the better situation. But it wasn't the right direction for me. I waned full time to provide for my family, medical was very important to me."
good,"Was a good job to work at, the managers and other employees treated every one nice. Crew members don't mind lending a hand to make sure the work gets done"
good,"Typically it is a fairly relaxed place to work. You can talk with other employees, learn about new products, and learn from others as you go. During the holiday season it can get a little busy and stressful at times. However, the management prepares you for the busy time and gives you ample support and confidence to make the holiday season run smooth."
good,"Employers are friendly and helpful. They have a flexible schedule and are always concerned with your welfare. Good place to learn about sales, customer service and products. Great benefits in terms of employee discounts."
good,That was a great working experience working for them and I learned a lot working there and I also was taught how to properly drive and inspect box trucks.
good,It was a profession work environment that helps develop its employees. I have worked as a part time customer service employee and over the years my leader has been working on my development. My development has allowed me to grow as a person and learn important leadership skills.
good,Very energetic workplace with a lot of very good people to work for and with. Great atmosphere with multiple ways to advance your career with them. Very pleased with the experience.
good,Best Buy as a company is a nice place to work. With a comfortable dress code to managers that care about their team it is a company that cares a lot about their employees.
good,"En un buen ambiente de trabajo, solo que cuando mucho flujo de gente puede tornarse un poco cansado."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Eatontown managers are awesome. I've heard some negative feedback from other locations. Store #1895 is an awesome place to work. Everyone gets along and helps each other out.
good,"Great way to start in retail  fast paste  everyone is willing to help you with anything. Make sure you read what you are applying for  hours may vary depending on the position. It takes patience to work for retail, customers aren’t always friendly nor respectful."
good,Some stores are like a family and work together to help each other out when needed. I had fun working on the computers and helping people solve their issues. I liked figuring out new ways to get more computers fixed per day.
good,Sales associate for computer di and car electronics sometimes other departments also. The store is very fast past during the holidays. I learned most of my customer service skills at Best Buy
good,Good Company to work for if you like fast paced reatil jobs. Decent pay but working the holidays is a must so be prepared for that. Weekends tend to rotate
good,I learned to do my best and remain on task . Learned how to avoid drama and continue to do my work . I learned how to show up on time. The difficulties were that I couldn’t pick fast enough but I still made it
good,The thing about Best Buy is it is a destination place for consumers who are looking to buy the latest and greatest technology already. The greatest tip is to LISTEN to every customer and pay attention to every detail they're giving you. You then have the opportunity to create that experience for your customer through building rapport.
good,"I was geek squander in the road, very nice climat and work culture! As a job student and fill time job, flexible schedule and great management. Focus on customers"
good,"Fun place to work with friends and great culture. Learned many leadership skills. Compensation could be higher given the amount of revenue one was tasked to produce a month, especially during the holiday."
good,"Work is fast paced and I often feel like management needs to give mobile associates the keys to get to phones to sell to people rather than have them unlock the doors. On busy days it can delay the process by quite a while."
good,"I had fun most days at work. I worked here while I was in high school and enjoyed the atmosphere. The management team engaged with us daily and helped us reach our daily, monthly, and quarterly goals."
good,"customer service representative at best buy includes A point-of-sale responsibilities  , return and exchange, PRC . managing the volume of customers  on both side customer service register and check out register."
good,"Each day at work is filled with some major or minor challenges that helps you to be creative, learn from those challenges and have fun while being the best."
good,Good company so far only been working for 2 months. I wish I could get some more hours but I'm happy with the hours I receive so far. Theres a lot to learn and u have to be focused on the job. I've learned how to interact better with people and learn more on how to run a business
good,Best Buy has been a diverse cultural atmosphere that is fun and educational. They encourage the associates to learn and provide great tools  to do so.
good,The environment was great !! love working with people and being able to do different task everyday! the management needed some work however there was to much favoritism going around and the relationships from it has been toxic. Overall its a great job.
good,Compared to other jobs I've had the atmosphere was very laid back. I learned a lot about technology through their etrainings and through filling in at other departments during staffing shortages. The only thing that was somewhat difficult was the long retail hours and always being on your feet. Holidays during black Friday and Christmas we're the worst for work life balance. Would have felt more motivated if the pay included commission and bonus rather than just bonuses based on overall store performance.
good,"There is always something new to learn at Best Buy. You can go in expecting you know it all and then there would be new product or a new sale. Explaining the specs on a product with confidence is key. If I didn't know something specific there is always someone that does know. Being open and honest with a customer or guest was always key. The work place is fun to a point. Asking different departments whats they have on sale to maximize sales is a fun way to get a leg up. "
good,Working at best buy is great. You have the support of your team and help is always available. Management is understanding and overall they want your success if you are willing to put in the work.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Bestbuy was a pretty laid back place. Everyone was friendly so it helped keep a stress free environment within the work place. Best buy was not a bad job at all.
good,"Very lax environment, training is easy, people become family not just a workforce, lots of fun events. There is a lot of room to grow and different departments to choose from"
good,"Lots of flexibility, management was not overbearing but helpful when needed. Employees were allowed enough autonomy that they maintained individuality"
good,While working at Best Buy management always made sure we were properly trained and took interest in what we all wanted as employees. On a day to day basis I would work in customer service to help with returns and exchanges as well as answer the phone to answer client questions and help place online orders.
good,"Best Buy understands that societal norms are changing as well as the economy. They are willing to adapt and listen to their employees, their most valuable asset."
good,"Everyday is set with a new challenge and goal which motivates you for the day. You learn how communicate with a wide variety of customers and how to help them out. Management is usually very helpful, they want to help you succeed in your job. I thoroughly enjoyed being on my own and working with the customers one-on-one."
good,"Best Buy is an amazing place. At my store, management was incredible. I just wouldn't stay there as a career- it takes too long to advance if you are not in the best place at the best time."
good,"Only worked during the holidays but it was a good work experience, would consider working here again if I need to. Starting pay is good and hours are flexible, well at least for seasonal employees."
good,Bestbuy is a good place to work especially when starting out with companies. I started with them with almost no previous sales experience and learned a lot by being there.
good,Its a great job that has a great team environment that other associates can learn from when trying to apply for other jobs related to tech. Also when doing work and making numbers they reward the team that sold the most in the store so a lot of recognition
good,The managers need to improve with open communication with their employees. There always lacked communication with people on the sales floor. Other than that it was a good experience.
good,Great starting-out or first-time place to work for many reasons. You have the ability to grow as a salesperson in a comfortable environment. Thanks for learning with me team.
good,"Absolutely loved it there. wished to go back. Great management team, great diversity, culturilistic background. the opportunity for advancement. was unreal."
good,Place was nice with a very fun and cheerful environment. Really felt like you were part of the team. You were always learning and really motivated to sell and help achieve selling goals. The people who worked there were awesome and upper management was easy to talk to as well. Plus discount was super nice!
good,"If you like technology and learning about it, this may be a good job for you. Each store is different, but at mine management gave us incentives for quality sales, credit card applications, etc and usually involved food. Vendors also bring in food occasionally. I learned a lot my time at BBY and I think it was a neat place to work."
good,"personally fun, side job. keeping updated and learning how to sell tech CAN be easy, but fun. eLearning, accomodations, discount is well worth it. If your coworkers and you get along, the store will run smoothly. Managers were dope, coworkers were a walk of life, customers are customers, no matter where you go. I learned alot here."
good,Great interaction with co-workers and customers.Enjoyed helping customers searching for products and support. Continued restocking for availability by keeping products available on the sales floor.
good,"the culture of the organization is driven by sales. The company is at the forefront of all technology, tea building and employee recognition. your success is measured through your performance knowledge and ability to sell. Fun, fast paced and energized environment. Customer satisfaction scores are a driving force in you and your teams future success and goals."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,You will have every opportunity to explore your career path and to advance if you want to. They will give you every bit of education that you will need to be able to sell their products.
good,I personally did not work on the sales floor but was instead apart of the warehouse crew. Truck days were fun but during the holidays they were brutal. Also did a lot of overnights and inventory related tasks. Overall a pretty solid place to work.
good,"Perfecto para estudiantes, el desarrollo dentro de la empresa puede ser lento o nulo. A veces pareces crecer por favoritismo."
good,"Best Buy is great company to work for, more than anything there is self growth. You learn things about yourself that you have never known before. It helped me break out of my shell and learn my strengths. There are great benefits about the company; such as, 401k, tuition reimbursement, employee discounts, insurance, and much more. What you give is definitely what you get in the company."
good,"Over my years at Best Buy, I did many things. While holidays and weekends were hard, I worked with a good group of people and more often then not, the company did the right thing for its employees."
good,"Every day is pretty similar, lots of fun with great coworkers. I learnt a lot about sales and just socialization in general. Management kinda sucks. They are nice to you, but only care about numbers. So, if you're having a bad month, they couldn't care less about you. If you're having a good month, you get treated like royalty lol. The hardest part of the job is keeping on top of your numbers. It can be really stressful, especially if you have a minimum hour requirement, because they'll cut your hrs if you aren't doing well. Best part of the job is helping people. You aren't just working, you're talking to people all day."
good,It’s a great place to work if you are a competitive and hardworking person. If you are looking to just go to a job and giving minimal performance than it’s not for you. It’s a reason why Best Buy makes so much money is because of its employees. Competitive atmosphere you can’t really relate it to the aspect of a furniture store but every person is willing to help at all times. Watch the employees who will interfere when you are talking to a customer to say that they helped or take credit of a sale.
good,Overall great place to work if you like technology and moving at a fast pace. It is a great place to learn about the newest technology and see it in action.
good,Working for Best Buy remotely was fine I got to see my family and everything hours were good. Geek Squad had a number of training opportunities managers were easy to work with
good,"For the most part, departments will try to keep areas staffed and employees happy. With them being one of the last true standing electronic stores, they know they need to have everyone on board with their culture. My time at BestBuy did have its lows, but it wasn't because of the managers. Their progression depended on the floor level employees success too. When online web purchases became more apart of daily sales, I was moved to the Omnichannel team. Where we took calls and placed online orders for customers to pickup in stores-wherever the items were available. This became a very important part of their business and the support from all departments was very welcoming. After about a year, I was in line to get a supervisor position, but BestBuy restructured and basically phased out all supervisors and a few assistant manager positions. Thats why I left, the changes were too much and I wasn't able to move up any more than where I was. They have a good group of people at most stores and management usually takes care of them. Overall a good place to start customer service experience, but need luck and timing to progress further."
good,good place to work at with a freindly enviornment i worked on black friday and was completly ok with working and was trained fully with a great support team
good,Always a motivational and happy work environment. Great training programs. Plenty of advancement and extra hour opportunities. Great team morale. Frequent bonus opportunities.
good,"The location I worked at had great leaders and great opportunity for advancement. I cannot say the same about other locations. As a company, Best Buy seems to care about employees, but individual stores sometimes don't follow that commitment."
good,I always felt comfortable working at Best Buy. I feelmy career was enhanced by this experience and it allowed me to get my next job in the technical field.
good,working at best buy was productive as well as an innovative experience. The management was superb and every worker was treated and compensated the same.
good,Best buy is all about business. Management really took the time out to train me on what I needed to know. The managers do not micro-manage their employees as well.
good,"Its a company you love to work with. Great work, great learning. You have great mentors to guide you. Best part is their open door policy. Best practices to follow for Project implementation."
good,Best entry level job you can probably find out the door with no experience compared to to other food and retail entry level jobs. Depending of where you work and management will determine on pay and how the work environment is.
good,"Working as a causal student to wanting to learn how a business operates. Best Buy can guide you in all directions. Their is plenty of areas to grow in from Sales, Inventory, Asset Protection, Leadership Training, Repairs, Installers theirs a field for everyone."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Esta bueno pra comenzar, ademas hay muchos jovenes y no discriminan"
good,"Best Buy is a company that prides itself on the employee experience and the culture it builds within the corporate walls.  They are always striving to build a better experience for both the customer and the employee, and understand the importance of both."
good,My experience with Best Buy was mostly positive. It really can be a fun place to work so long as you have positive people around you. Difficult customers can sometimes wear you down but that is to be expected in any retail store.
good,This was a seasonal position that I really enjoyed. I would have liked to stay on if it were possible. I was able to learn a lot about technology and really enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,A typical day at work here would be greeting customers as they walked in if you were pretty slow or just stay in your area and confront them when they are near. Management wasn't bad they are all great people there.
good,Always found it to be a team oriented environment and it seems like they’ve made even more strides in the correct direction recently. Felt like I had the tools to improve if I was struggling with something.
good,Working for Best Buy was a great experience. Even though I worked in the warehouse department I still was able to and allowed to learn different areas of the business.
good,"it was good for what it was if you want to advance to manager its easily done if the store likes you and is willing to help. work was fair, the truck nights were pretty late most of the time but nothing someone cant handle"
good,"Very flexible hours, great team effort, always promoting from within and a fun place to work. There are days where the company would do team events also to strengthen the bond such as play baseball or even bowl."
good,"If you want to be promoted, you will work extra hours and sometimes have no life. If you want extra hours, its pretty easy to go pick them up. Good money for the most part."
good,"Cool place to work, management is pretty cool, the job was fun. Plus i really did enjoy helping customers. It was a really easy job. Just learn the specs and sell."
good,Best Buy is a fun place to work. You get to work with a good team and learn a lot of new skills. You get a great discount and it’s a lot of fun. Great work environment
good,"Perform a variety of job functions on a day to day basis like Direct Sales, Inventory and Product Management including Shrink Control, Gap Management, Merchandising Assist Activities, Sales Forecasting & Goal Planning, Customer follow ups and handling customer opportunities, Execution of Retail SOPs, Team Orientation and Training, Opening and Closing duties, Cash Handling, Sales Floor Sales Lead, Manager on Duty and other sales/non sales assist activities etc."
good,"Good place to work for a part-time job, easy to balance work and university. For the amount of work done on holiday days, the pay is not worth it though. But the benefits are great."
good,It was a great first job. A good introduction to customer service. The training I received was good. Management really helped me and we’re understanding of work/life balance.
good,Just got to wait for your turn to get promoted or find a other location (BB) that is hiring to get promoted. Got to work all out every shift to get noticed.
good,the position I had was to put movies and cd's out. To do inventory to 100%. Customer service. the most enjoyable was seeing my regular customers and meeting new ones. The worst part of my job was my feet hurting because of working on cement floors for 15 years.
good,you learn to communicate with others and position yourself in conversations. great place for product knowledge and service knowledge. if you are starting up then its a great place. work life depends on management
good,Good company to work with if you know what your goals are and what you want out of it. Had a great experience working for the company and it was fun working with people in the similar age group.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The environment was a bit overwhelming. Although it would be nice if there was more interaction past the employee and coworkers. Everything else was okay.
good,"- Learned how to open and close cash tills/admin"
good,Like all retail it really depends on your customers and you. I worked in Geek Squad and left only because we became an Authorized Apple Service Provider. All my time was working on phones and not computers so I left. Other then that the benefits were good and the discount was 5% above cost.
good,"Great environment to work for most. If it wasn't for the way the manager run the store and show favoritism, the store would be great. Best Buy has great potential and I enjoyed the benefits. I wouldn't mind coming back if there was a change in management."
good,"Worked overnight trucks when I first started which was perfect for me as I was in school. Moved to days and worked asset protection, managers were very helpful and understanding. The environment was very positive. Worked part time and was paid fairly. Only thing I'd say negatively is that part time does not get benefits as far as health."
good,"I've heard horror stories about some store's management, but my store had a good management team. Corporate however, made a habit of putting the stores in situations that were less than stellar, such as releasing a new system to use without doing a stress test and removing the 'previous' system right before, or during a major launch. They then expected the stores to be able to handle the broken system that didn't work correctly."
good,Always a pleasure working with different kinds of people at best buy. Many varieties of people and personalities make up many fun and unique teams with remarkable talents and skills.
good,"Engaging place to work with friendly and helpful coworkers. Multiple employee benefits including discounts on all mainstream electronics. "
good,Best buy is a great starting point to learn more about businesses and how they are ran from management all the way down to the employees. Great job to grow in.
good,It was a decent job. You know what to expect when you go in. Management was good. Benefits were good. Hours varied by work load. Sometimes got off early. Pay was good.
good,"As a part-time merch specialist, if you work hard you'll get good hours and good pay, but you are held responsible for more things than any other position in the store so it can be pretty stressful at times."
good,Good place to work nice environment and friendly people. More training would be nice they only train you about 2 hours and let you do the rest on the computer hands on training would be better.
good,"help customers, deal with issues, make big sales, train and coach associates. Make sure we adhere to company policy and procedure . Provide world class customer service"
good,"Enjoyed working there and began as a seasonal working which led to a permanent role.  Left to look for more technical role.  Very driven to sell product warranties to provide customer service, which is of high importance."
good,"good place to work. days are long, but four days off. training period is short. easy to catch on and good people to work with. Some e learning are required"
good,since the time i was there it was always fun and filled with good energy. i never thought about it as work always a good energetic place to be. the work was different but never away from my capabilities.
good,"This is a great place to work that accommodates your specific work hours and allows you to shape yourself into a great, knowledgeable part of the team! Plenty of evolving tech to expand your horizon and learn about what interests you the most to converse with co-workers and customers to learn more, become professional and grow. The work is minimum wage and not competitive or commission based even in the mobile department, so it is not the place to stay forever for a competitive wage, but is a great place to start your career."
good,Great place to work if you like fast paced work. Must be open to working Holidays.  Employee discount is great.  Supervisors and management must take a lot of E learnings.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,COMPETETIVE FAST PACED. Good company to work for. Can move up if you work hard to stand out. Culture sometimes needs changing but if you can change then you can make the work environment fun.
good,The days varied depending on how much workload there was. Sometimes the day goes by fast because of so many clients. Other days dragged because no client really came in.  I learned how to handle certain customer situations.  The workplace culture was great. The leadership really enforced the culture of Bestbuy and Geek Squad. The hardest part of the job is staying on task because of the high traffic. Its easy to lose track of what you were doing last.  The most enjoyable part was helping clients with their problems and seeing them express gratitude. The other enjoyable part is troubleshooting new technology and becoming familiar with the product.
good,"Client facing role with issue Management Team"
good,"Great place to work. Stressful around the holidays, never hire people in time to get them effectively trained but other then that it usually went off well."
good,It’s pretty slow so you’ll have time to meet all your coworkers. Other than that the customers themselves are fine. Some drama but every job has their issues.
good,Best Buy had a supportive managerial staff to both teach you how to sell properly while pushing you to improve your individual sales. The hours were always reasonable and the work environment was positive and enthusiastic.
good,"fun place to work , it was my first job in Canada , I was lucky to get in "
good,Never really had a problem with coworkers. Management sucked. They say they are flexible but in reality they want you to bend over backwards for them. Not a hard job at all. Its actually pretty fun always talking with new customers.
good,Overall a great job for an introduction to sales. Day to day life at bestbuy is great for the job it is. It does get stressful at times when it is busy. But overall great job
good,"great place to work especially if you are competitive, works with my school schedule. Management is always willing to help you if you are having problems meeting your goals"
good,"When I started to work for the company I knew very little about technology other than the newest update on my iPhone. The company gives you training on multiple areas to be certified to sell. Along with opportunity to learn more across the board. This company is very big on teamwork. You win, lose, and learn together. You are celebrated for your victories as well. "
good,"Fun and interactive work environment. They make you work the way they want you to, not very accepting of differing ways of selling products. Wouldn't suggest long term work."
good,"The hardest part of the job is customer relations. Management can sometimes be frustrating and feel scattered. Work place culture is very heavily geared towards your own personal brand, so you have to be aware of your actions about yourself."
good,Everything is measured on a scorecard and how you rank dictates the level of engagement from upper management.   The better you do as a store the less you hear from others.
good,"Tienen una buena cultura laboral y buen ambiente de trabajo con horarios flexibles que se adaptan para cualquier persona que este estudiando, al igual que la capacitacion para diversos temas es muy regular."
good,"Best Buy's customers can be incredibly hard to work with, as stressful situations and conversations are often triggered by misunderstanding technology, spending high-dollar amounts for expensive tech and home products, misguided orders, and sometimes rudeness/entitlement. This is generally true of any retail environment, but customers could become especially testy when it came to the kinds of items Best Buy sells. "
good,Best buy has great benefits for full-time employees. For part time there aren't really any benefits besides discounts and 401k. If you work on the sales floor it is a highly competitive environment as far as hitting daily budgets and sales. In customer service it is different. There are still goals to hit but not the same as the sales floor.
good,"Great starter job, room too grow if interested. the training is pretty good for what the job requires. The work is fun and interactive. You have the chance to meet really good people."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"the coworkers were great, and made it fun to come into work. Customers were always coming in, and everyone was happy to assist with any questions they might have."
good,"Best Buy is all about work culture, they pride them selfs on promoting a fun and enjoyable work environment. Always felt like i was with family and not colleagues."
good,"In the past 5 years, Best Buy has provided me with sufficient development to move forward with career aspirations. Great benefits, discount programs, and overall fun place to work."
good,"I was a college student so it was a good place to make some OK money for a college student. Hitting quotas didnt make sense to me because I was not getting commission on what I sold, so I would make a sale and coworkers would be foaming at the mouth to ring up my customer. It was unnecessary to me. If the job was more commissioned based it would be amazing."
good,As a former Projects Team member were able to drive to multiple shops so were not locked to one store so each job even though repetitive every single one is different.
good,Management makes all the difference.  They either make you or break you!  I used to hate working at Best Buy but did it for a few years then I got promoted and moved to a different store where life at work became so much better.  I had upper management at the second store who were very supportive and team members who worked hard.  It was night and day between the 2 stores!
good,This was my second job and I enjoyed the environment and the people I met! management was understanding with my school schedule!  The discounts were amazing. I would recommend to a friend.
good,"My experience working here was great. They offer competitive pay and they also have really good discounts on products and services. "
good,"I had fun being there. There were jokes here and there between employees, but work was the number one priority. I'd say that, while we joked, we also got a good amount of work done."
good,Working at Best Buy was a fun experience for me. It was one of my first jobs and it provided me with a way to grow as an individual. If I did not have to leave I would have been happy to stay and work on advancing my position in the company.
good,"The culture at Best Buy was the best part. I made so many good friends working there. The job itself was awesome as well, the only negatives are since it is retail, you will work lots of nights and pretty much every single weekend which I wasn't a fan of, but isn't a negative for everyone. Other than that, I would still work there."
good,Great place to work with great management. Excellent place for someone starting out such as students. Hours are great as well and co-workers are very welcoming and helpful.
good,"Great place to work.  The people I worked with are family.  If managers treat you like family, then you don't just have a job.  The job is not hard.  You just have to understand and know how to talk and take care of customers."
good,"Working at the company was fine. Nice cool people there to work with. Comfortable work environment. "
good,"My overall experience is going great, I really enjoy working with all the people over at the store. When it comes to management its a bit more tough to describe because in my store, there was a really big change in management with a new GM and a whole bunch of leaders leaving and new ones being brought on board from different stores around the district. The full time work benefits are great, the schedule is really fair if you get to talk to your supervisor and let them know what type of a weekly schedule that you were looking for. You're guaranteed two days off a week so that is a plus and you also get to know your schedule roughly two weeks in advance."
good,Had a good time while working for Best Buy. Got along with everyone and it was often times a relaxed job. Got time off when I needed without any real hassle
good,"Staff is friendly and helpful to new hires , I had an awesome time and a short time before I knew what I was doing , I quit my job at Best Buy to move back to Florida."
good,It is a nice place to work the people are very considerate and it is a good working environment everybody gets along well and the customers are satisfied
good,"Buena empresa, es un lugar de trabajo agradable y bastante cómodo, las prestaciones son de lo mejor que hay y la estabilidad laboral es consistente aunque no fácil aún así, siempre hay oportunidades, cursos, apoyo didáctico, talk y todos pueden acceder a ello."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"in Real life is a huge school for any body wants to grow in technology and take a lot experience for futures works."
good,"Good overall company to work for that isn't afraid to shift in different to shift its focus. Management can vary, some are great others and not so great. Friendly coworkers willing to help."
good,"Overall, best buy will be either one of those places that can empower you. If you are there for a paycheck, they will pay you, if you desire more, then there are opportunities that pay quite well, for people who can adjust their comfort zone."
good,Best Buy was a place of comfort where I began to enjoy working until I realized that we finally aren't getting paid for what we sale but are compensated with bonuses and open availability.
good,cool place to work at. it has great management and the benefits are amazing. starting salary is higher than minimum wage. and now im just going to type to fill in the 150 minimum.
good,I was on the road with a knowledgeable technician who made me more knowledgeable. No two days were alike. I am better and more technically proficient for the experience.
good,"Bestbuy is a good company to work but I need more"
good,"During my time at Best Buy, I had really great managers and the Best Buy Culture was of great value. The management treated their employees well and they were very flexible about hours, school schedules, family life, etc. "
good,"This was an awesome job, especially for high school. Showed room to advance up. Each day was slightly different because of the customer interaction. Management made sure things got done, but employees were happy."
good,See for yourself.  It is a pretty good place to work.  I felt that I had job security.  The manges were friendly.  Being the only electronics store in the you see just about everyone in Lufkin.
good,Store managers were great and on the long days (store set up for grand opening) they were very encouraging. there was a planogram of everywhere something should go on the shelf
good,"I love working at best buy, nice people and nice place with lots of fun.I recommend my other friend too, if they want more experience or fun in working environments."
good,But its all about who you know to grow in this place. But great place to start at and the work if great and not to hard to learn. Just make connections and network.
good,Everyone is very friendly and competitive. The managers are always trying to help you better yourself and help you meet your goals. Sales goals for the day are obtainable.
good,Being a Warehouse Associate/Inventory person is the like being the grunt of the store. Breaking down trucks & putting out merchandise on the sales floor. You will also be required to clean and stock the bathrooms as well.
good,"BestBuy was a great place to work through college. They accommodated my school schedule very well and made sure to give me enough hours to pay for school. Management was encouraging and always gave us opportunities to move around or up in the company. Part time doesnt come with a lot of great benefits, but the discount makes up for it. You'll be asked to work outside of your regular department occasionally but it is never that bad and makes you look better. Management can play favorites sometimes. I really enjoyed my coworkers, I learned a lot about customer service with them and made some good friends."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Overall best buy is a great company to work for. Being employed there almost 9 years now, I've seen a lot of changes. Management currently is wonderful to work for. Most annoyances come from poorly trained employees who don't know how to order items correctly, or schedule appointments with not nearly enough time to cover the service"
good,"Great training infrastructure , hand you the tools to do your job correctly."
good,I would definitely recommend anyone who is looking for a job to apply for Best Buy. its a great environment for all kinds of people. Definitely a great culture within those walls. You meet so many kinds of customers.
good,I may have complained alot but best buy is a good plave to work i learned alot. The stores always feel like a big family. Retail is retail and can be annoying at times but  best buy def one of the better ones.
good,A fun and exciting workplace that gave such great opportunity for advancement. Sad they dont care more about family and flexibility. Wonderful benefits were always a plus also
good,"Its a good company to work for.They pay well for what the job is, and management is good. Bonuses can help a lot if the store is able to hit their monthly sales goal."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work. They take care of their employees, and truly exemplify excellent customer service. Great development paths in store, I became a Supervisor in under a year."
good,Good fair work environment. Very happy with management was a good experience. Typical sales job working directly with several customers. There were quotas but there was no commission.
good,work can be very calm easy depending on the staff that you are working with that particular day and shift. slow days are the worst but they come and go but the fast days seem like you were there and back home rapidly
good,"The job was very informative about what you needed to do regarding to your occupation. The management was concerned about employees, and paid well. The hardest part would be only getting use to everything when you first start the job maybe for 2 weeks after that everything becomes pretty obvious."
good,"Great company to work for."
good,"The location where i worked at, was a very busy place. we received customers from all over the world. I enjoyed this a lot because i was able to interact and help customers from different nationalities. which made me work on my language skills and doing my best to understand the needs of the customers. i spoke English, Spanish and a little bit of Portuguese which i learned through interactions with customers. the working environment was great, it was a multi culture workplace. many employees from different nationalities worked there which i loved because i learned a lot about the diversity in culture at work. in my case i worked with Portuguese speakers and English Speakers which made my language barrier become better. Spanish is my first language and i was able to improve my language skills through interactions with my coworkers. helping customers get what they needed was great, sending them off with a smile was great and talking about the latest products with my coworkers was interesting, i  experience many moments where i was able to go out my way to help a customer and that helped me grow as a person. to me it wasn't about what i sold to the customer but if i was able to satisfy the customer with my help. and get them everything they needed. sometimes we didn't fulfill our goals, which made management question our work ethic. but at the end we still did our best to both fulfill our work ethic and helped the customers. i was able to become a more open person thanks to this job. i was able to interact which hundreds of people which made me gain more confidence in myself."
good,"A typical day consisted of maintaining and restocking merchandise on the sales floor.  Also, verifying prices were accurate on products in my section. As well as, unloading  merchandise from delivery trucks."
good,good place to work as an individual growing up. Hard to find committed individuals to work with. Most are students in high school looking for their first job
good,Would work there again. Enjoyed the employee discount. Good environment with a good chance to move up within the company. Benefits were better than most jobs.
good,"You have access to the latest and greatest technology and get to share and with clients. Continual learning and education on products and services. As a Geek Squad Advanced Repair Agent, teaching clients about their products that they had purchased was very rewarding. Culture was to to have continued learning, and sharing knowledge was important. Long hours to continue to educate and finish repairs in a timely manner."
good,"This company means well, but if you are one of the top sales members you will always be over looked over, due to making departments to much money....."
good,Overall a good job. I enjoyed my time there. Lack of advancement in my field was a major factor for leaving............................................
good,"was good, dont really have anything bad to say about my time there. Was pretty basic work, nothing crazy about what i had to do every day. Simple sales work."
good,Great place to work if you can get in. Great people and like-minded customers. Would recommend working there if you like tech and are passionate about it.
good,if you're passionate about technology and are skilled at sales then this is a perfect fit for you. Pay is hourly plus monthly bonuses depending on if the store as a whole reaches its goal.
good,worked together with fellow coworkers to get product out and sold with best knowledge to provide to customers also offering the newest technology to the consumers
good,"-good company that allows you to move up in positions"
good,"If you're into technology Best Buy is good place to work. Depending the on the store location the people and management can be quite good. The pay is slightly above average especially since the bonus system was restructured. Previously I would've said it was pretty solid, now I have a harder time paying the bills. They have pretty good training for people wanting to learn and obviously a decent discount too."
good,"if you love electronics. you will love working at best buy, great people to work with great managers and a fun environment to work in. you will want to go to work everyday."
good,Best Buy is a solid company overall.  They have great sales trainings for their associates.  The retail management experience provided me with the building blocks I needed in order to advance my career.  Also have a great discount for their employees.
good,Was a good job and a good 5 years till they up and showed me the door because they restructured. Corporate america back at it again i guess. such is life
good,"Help customers throughout the day with given responsibilities and very flexible scheduling.Engaged with customers using selling skills, to complete the sale, drive profitable growth and achieve individual goals while showing and inspiring customers to see what is possible with technology"
good,Great place to work at. Everyone there is always glad to help out and inform you. management is attentive and respectful. Hours were relatively flexible but still manageable.
good,BestBuy was in a transitional period when I worked there. Overall it was a professional work environment but it sometimes pushed their sales team to meet unfair goals
good,"Great place to work.  Only downfall is that is was not commission based.  Only hourly.  So it did not matter how many phones or service plans you sold, you only received hourly wage.  Maybe bonuses if targets are it."
good,Overall it was a good place to work at the management was very helpful and hands on. The work environment was friendly and flexible. I was able to learn a lot about the merchandise that we sold.
good,great place to work  if anyone gets a opportunity to work there take it it will open you up to new skills and the work culture is great.  would really recommended.
good,"Typical work day consisted of helping customers, stocking inventory, cleaning the store, fixing issues with orders, ordering items for customers, and making sure you're all caught up on your education."
good,"I worked in Best Buy for around 5 months as a Co-op student. I learn a lot of things there, though not everything I wanted to learn. The general experience was pleasant. Not much that can be said besides that. If you have ever worked in retail, you already know what to expect."
good,I took a job with BB as a way to supplement income while going to school after I fulfilled my commitment to the Marine Corps. This was a great opportunity to learn a retail type atmosphere but have fun while doing so. The people I worked with were great and supportive. I  ultimately left due to finding a new career path.
good,"For the most part, I had a great experience working at Best Buy. The pay isn't the best, but it was better than previous retail settings I worked at. The employee discount is great and the customer's, for the most part, are generally good. Didn't move into a leadership role while working there, but as an employee in the lower end of the spectrum, it wasn't bad."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Pudimos desarrollar nuestra labor de una manera cómoda y totalmente a gusto
good,Best Buy has been ranked in the top 100 jobs in Canada for a reason. The management team is bread to help the associates grow and work hard. This doesn't take away from the fact that they strive to make best buy a fun place to work. Allowing us to act natural and enjoy ourselves on the job rather than being too strict.
good,Loved working there it gave me a lot of character and great opportunities to learn. Everyone is helpful and striving to do their best whenever it is possible.
good,Productive place and environment. If looking to move up in the ladder of success this is a good place. You can learn a lot from your peers if you want to get better at your job. Open opportunities to try new positions as well.
good,Pay us competitive and work environment is great. From my store it always seems I'm going to work with my family as opposed to co-workers! I really enjoy working here!
good,"sometimes as an inventory specialist you might have a more than strict boss, that will get on you about the timing and placement of products even when you are doing your job accurately . Just to nag I guess."
good,"great place to work and put your foot through the door to gain good amount of experience with lots of technology, and teaches you a lot about working as a team."
good,It's a fast paced job but the pay is the best for any of the retail positions in Wichita KS. they work well with your schedule if you are a student. it can be pretty busy.
good,It was a good place to work.People were friendly and very helpful when needed. I enjoyed the time spent with certain co-workers. Benefits were good and they offered time off if needed for being sick or if there were any kind of unexpected life emergencies.
good,"I liked my co-workers and management was always fair, it was fun to talk to fellow employees (including ones from different departments) and I never felt cheated or forced by management. A fun place to work."
good,"Overal the job experience is great, in whatever field you hope to pursue in life whether its in sales, sales associate, or in computers its present a lot of opportunities. however I'm now shifting my energy more towards my field of computers."
good,"I worked in the Chilliwack location and was lucky enough to have very understanding and fun managers!"
good,Best Buy was a great place to work. It was hectic at times but it was still very fun. Also it's a great way to learn about electronics and succeed in the customer service field
good,"If you are hard working and stay busy, they will notice and they will  try they're best to help you out with hours, pay, etc. The environment is very relaxed and family oriented, you feel welcomed."
good,"As working on a temporary contract, I enjoyed my position and the support given by my supervisors and colleagues.  I would recommend a position with BestBuy to anyone willing to work hard and who enjoy technology."
good,Assisting customers find new tech that best suits their needs. Learned a lot about learning new things in a short amount of time when customers from different departments ask you for assistance. Friendly work environment and staff members are all team players.
good,"I was initially taken on as a ""seasonal"" employee shortly before thanksgiving, and then moved over to part-time in the Computing department after Christmas. Been working here 5 months at the time of writing this."
good,They were a great place to work with! My fellow employees were the best thing about working at Best Buy. They also paid competitively at the time. One down side was that they required me to be available 5 days of the week while I was still in school.
good,"Best Buy is a great company with a strong sense of values and creates an environment that creates a relaxed yet productive work place. While this is a great job for high school or college kids, the ability for advancement through management is rare."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I'd rather not talk about my time at best buy, I was a teenager. However I made good money and was treated pretty fairly. They understood that I was still working but didn't factor in my anxiety."
good,"I was actually working from home for best buy as a"
good,Best buy was a great place to work but I am getting older and retail hours keep me away from my family also the pay is not great for a adult in their 30s with 2 kids. They do not try to work with you on weekends I worked every weekend for my last year their. So they could be more flexible with the schedule  but they are not.
good,Good Team I love everything about working at Best Buy except for working sundays. You are recognized for everything you do. Management is incesibly attentive to your needs
good,Management cares about personal growth and achievement. Good benefits. In the camera experience shop they offer formal training with professional photographers and it really helps with the job.
good,They gave me an opportunity at a young age to learn and better myself. The company helped me get to where I am today. Through them I learned a lot of valuable lessons that you can't necessarily teach someone. They helped set me up for future success with their training programs in the store and away from the store. I can't thank Best Buy enough for teaching me everything they did. I miss the environment there from time to time. We always had fun while being the best! I would never forget this job.
good,Start the day at 7:45am and scheduled off at 4:30 pm but would have to stay late if you thought you could get the job done in a reasonable amount of time.
good,Laid back place to work. Promotes within. fair compensation.  Negative are the retail hours one are to work.  Good job to communicate and work on people skills as you are to communicate to incoming people entering the store.
good,Throughout the years it was always a good place to work as well as fun. Traveling with them I was able to visit different Best Buy's and interact with all types of people.
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work. If you like selling things to people, then it is a great fit for you. I enjoyed my coworkers and selling things. I liked selling Home Theater the most."
good,"Working at Best Buy was fast, but with a lot of costumer service. Learned a lot. Meet and talked with a lot of people. Management was always available when needed."
good,"Everyone helps everyone. Store meeting were uplifting and productive. Although Its can get very busy, manager was always close to make sure things ran smoothly. I built a good relationship with my manager. Very understanding."
good,Realistic sale goals. Willing to train in all departments with known expectations. Overall a good retail company to work for. Management was good and supportive.
good,"Everyone working there was very friendly and supportive. coworkers and management were helpful and I learned lots about technology while working there, even for a short period of time."
good,"Great place to work, the logistics division is challenging during peak times from November through December but very manageable the rest of the year. Good benefits plus a 401K plan with a good match"
good,Best Buy is a great started job. It's also a great job to move up to a supervisor position but after that it goes down. gaining a year or two being a supervisor is good. After that time you can leave to look for a management  job. The Staff are extremely fun to work with might i add.
good,"Worked for Best Buy under a seasonal contract and have to say that it is a great place to work, has a great set of supervisors and managers running the store."
good,This was a very fun and fast pace work environment. I learned a lot of the latest and greatest technology. The workplace culture was motivating. Hardest part about the job was not being able to assist everyone at once.
good,"Great benefits and workplace culture, office has a nice gym service with classes, on-site physiotherapy and massage chairs are available, cafeteria has good food"
good,Working at Best Buy in Sunnyvale was a great experience. A typical day was centered around unloading merchandise and making sure it reached the sales floor. Management was always supportive and there was great communication among the team. At times new releases could make work hectic but with time the training i received helped me get through work.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Seasonal work is great but they do not give you any breaks and instead get you a free soda as an incentive to work more than 8 hours when unloading a truck. Can be seen as a positive or negative for anyone. But also the company got rid of the Gamer's Club Unlocked option.
good,"I would work for BestBuy again, the staff culture was friendly and I enjoyed supervision of students and mature staff members. The pay was on par with other retail environments."
good,"Over my five+ years with Best Buy, I've been in three stores, had many different managers, and dealt with quite a few customers. Overall, this is a great entry level job or collage job."
good,"Working at BestBuy in Atascocita as a seasonal employee was a pleasurable experience. It took a few weeks for the co-workers to warm up to me but they were kind and sincere. My favorite part was meeting the variety of customers and getting hearing their life stories and getting different opportunities from them. I will say that work life is definitely different than what I perceived it being working at BestBuy as a child, but there are still the people to be fond of. The managers were serious about their work, but they were reasonable, flexible, and had great personalities with nice humor."
good,"I started BestBuy as a salesperson and because of support from management at the time, my day to day duties were manageable and low stress. After top influential managers were promoted and relocated, the dynamic of the store and goals were changed. They goals became completely based on different aspects of individual job performance."
good,"When Holidays, they gave free food, and when you got a BP, they gave you the option to choose a snack. In the mornings, sometimes are slow, but it gets busy."
good,"Began with pricing, stocking, up stocking, refilling endcaps, functionality for all electronic displays, banner placement, supply orders, planogram and pricing integrity."
good,"Would work there again, culture was awesome, management team was extremely helpful with my lack of sales experience. They tried and tried to help me with my first sales job unfortunately I couldnt get the picture at the time."
good,experiencia recomendada especialmente como primer trabajo
good,"Most days at Best Buy are pretty slow, but when it's busy there is a lot to do. Phone activation take up most of the time on those busy days. I learn how to activate a phone, the differences between phone networks and how to explain the specs and abilities of different phones. The environment at best buy is friendly. Everyone working there has known each other for a lot of years. There is no hard part of the job because there is always someone there to help you if you need it. I enjoy working with my customers, getting to know them and helping them to the best of my abilities."
good,Tons of foundation groundwork for starting out in the work place established here. The culture is sales driven but customer-centric. Fun place to work and always very mindful of people's schedules.
good,I would say compared to other retail jobs Best Buy in my opinion is one of the better ones available. decent pay with flexible schedules they allow you to grow and develop outside of best buy if that is not your primary career goal.  my only negative is during the holiday season which you are not allowed to be with family because of things like black Friday
good,"I worked at Best Buy for a year and I was able to promote to an ""ATT Mobile Expert."" They will give you training and they will check up on you to make sure that it isn't overwhelming."
good,"Plenty of room to grow if you put in the work."
good,"Friendly staff and easy to learn the jobs they give you, it's back and forth with slow paced until sales or holidays then it's super fast paced. My only issue is they don't tend to seasonal or occasional employees enough and train them properly."
good,"the people are friendly and always willing to lend a hand ."
good,a normal work at best buy consist of several different tasks throughout the course of the day.  opening shift job is to make sure the store is presentable for open that day. midday shift job is to maintain the downstocking that's needed to keep products at easy access for the customers.  and the closing realign the products throughout the store and ensure that all products are in their right location.
good,Very fun environment and I would work for this company again. They make it a very friendly environment to work and it makes customer service flow very easily
good,"Throughout the years that I worked at Best Buy, work was heavily focused on improving the customer experience, by improving the employee experience. Better training, better compensation, and better cultures were built to help us grow our business, retain customers and retain talent."

good,"Working at best buy was fun, stressful at times however I learned allot. Mangers worked well with us at Home theater to ensure the best possible customer service."
good,I don't hate working at GeekSquad as an Advanced Repair Agent. The pay is much lower than you would receive in a comparable position outside of retail however and there's not really any advancement opportunity unless you want to go into retail management (no thanks).
good,"As far as retail jobs are concerned, this was one of the best I have worked at. They gave me the opportunity to advance my career and knowledge within the company."
good,"I worked in many positions, but field agent was for sure the best. The warehouse staff was under appreciated and under paid, compensation for learning new skills is nonexistent, and lots of turn over in management"
good,A great discount and a focus on employee training were key aspects of Best Buy. Hours are very dependent on location and season however. No longer offering commission for sales.

The company works to advance from within and develop employees for higher level jobs. You are expected to be a self starter and work to push yourself to do better each day. Best Buy also gives a lot of training in product knowledge, sales, and customer service to get employees up to date and ready to meet the customers needs."

good,"I had loads of fun at Best Buy. When I worked there we were encouraged to have the latest tech with is while working in order to give customers honest reviews about new devices. This included phones and over ear headphones as well as blue tooth devices. It was a fairly relaxed environment, and generally everyone got along. I started at 10.50 an hour, which wasn't bad, but as a person going from warehouse work with a larger conpany to retail it was a bit of a financial hit. A great place all in all."
good,"cool job, lets you be who you are. learned a lot about sales and how to lead my team. the hardest part of the job is change. they are always trying to get better at doing things."
good,"Though many consider Best Buy a retail electronics company, it is a people company. It prioritizes diversity and empowerment of its people before all else."
good,It was my favorite place to work. Great friends and good times. I enjoy working with friends because you can take small breaks with each other and when things are slow you can talk to them or have them help you with anything.

good,"Great place to get job experience in the retail stores, however store leadership changes so frequently it can be difficult to build lasting business relationships. "

good,"This was a part time job and something to occupy my time while serving in the military. While I was and employee, I had great managers in most locations and a jerk in my last one."
good,Working at Best Buy is a good experience and ideal for entry level and working students. It proved to be a very diverse work environment. It does call for attention to detail due to high value/large quantity of products.
good,"I liked this job but it's not a career, you can make it a career but you have to love it. If you don't there will be a high turnover as this is more or less a temp job"
good,"It's a fun place to work at. A lot of training, but managers are not terribly pressuring. Very flexible schedules. Great to have benefits as a part timer. Discounts are good, pay is bad."
good,"Great place to work , mission driven, great place to learn about your abilities and skill set. As well as, being able to learn about other skills sets that can enhance your abilities."
good,Work is great there and it was a pleasure to work there. The only thing is to make sure you know the polices there to help you well there and you can get anywhere in that place

good,"I worked at best buy for almost a year"
good,"The job had a fun social atmosphere amongst the staff. I learned a lot about the latest tech gadgets as well as selling techniques. A typical day at work would be spending the day on the sales floor, selling products and services to customers and answering questions."
good,Lots of potential to have fun everyday at work. Management wants to get to know you and cares for your success. Realistic goals and incentives for being better than your goals.
good,"As a Geek Squad agent, I had a fun and challenging job installing A/V equipment.  I usually never ran into too many issues in the field, so I rarely had to bother my supervisor.  Good pay and benefits."
good,"At least at the store I was located at the team seemed to really enjoy their jobs. The discounts were great. This being really my first job, helped the beginning of my customer service skills to form. Meeting here were fun and educational. Acknowledgements were made to those who deserve them. Chances to move up in the company were available as well."
good,Was a fun place to work room for advancement if you can relocate pay is fair for the area people are nice and mostly knowledgeable hours will very holidays are stressful
good,Loved that I could transfer to other geek squads easily because I liked to move. 3 out of 4 managers were awesome. One manager I would never recommend but I guess there's always a bad apple here and there. For the most part I had a positive experience and job security was great. Also benefits for Full Time workers.
good,"The Job is honestly not a bad place to start off in the working force, but if you want to grow within the company you would honestly have to be there for quiet sometime and kiss a lot of people’s feet. But it’s definitely an amazing place to work in."
good,The work atmosphere is relaxed and the pay is competitive.  The benefits package is average and there is opportunity for  advancement if you're a hard worker.
good,"The workers are easy to get along with. The pay scale is a little low especially if you are fully independent. Its a bot repetitive, so once you learn the work it gets easier."
good,"Great environment. Loved the people and always fast paced. Everyone worked together as a team. Management always made it fun, but also about business."
good,"A normal day involves you greeting customers, hearing out their concerns about their device, offering them pricing options, then making computer repairs."
good,"Great benefits and pay! Best Buy does a good job of compensating their employees and they have fantastic medical, dental and 401K benefits. Fun place to work and there is room to grow. Be prepared to move if you really want to move up."

good,"I have worked here since March of 2018, and have had a great experience. I enjoy coming to work and helping people, as well as fixing broken technology. I am currently going to school for MIS, and this job aligns with my future career goals as a young person. I started as a Consultation Agent and after six months I was promoted to Advanced Repair Agent. While the pay they offered me was slightly lower than what I had expected, I was able to negotiate my wages to get what I felt was fair and matched my worth. Always come to work with your best foot forward and the company will respect you. While turn over is high, they value people who want to stay and always put their best effort forward. I have yet to say one bad thing about working for Geek Squad."
good,"Good place as a second job or during school. Would not be my full time job. Employee discount was great. Working black friday wasn't, but at least it was organized."
good,"Great company to work for and you do have opportunities to advance within. Unless your plan is making this company your career or management though I would recommend it as a very sturdy stepping stone. It is retail at the end of the day so you deal with all of the nuances that come with it. Granted it is more secure than most retail jobs and pay is better also, I wouldn't recommend trying to support a family off of it though (10-14 hourly) unless your at a management level (40K ish salary)"
good,I liked kinda hate that i left. It was fun and alright pay (even for part time hours). My manager was really nice and laid back. its a clean area and i got along with everybody i worked it. once again i hate that i left.
good,Getting to know the area you'll be working at is an important key to being a successful sales consultant. Learning the new tech and software will make you a shining star.
good,Great overall sales Foundation. The people i worked with were all of a similar mindset and had a interest in technology. All in all a good job for a young person.
good,"They will teach you and help build you up for the next position you want. Very easy to turn into a career. Awesome company as long as you dont make an hr statement. I watched many innocent people that simply reported sexual harrassment and other types of harrassment get targeted, further harrassed and fired."
good,If I could work with the same people I’d do it all over again. It was competitive & fun. If I would’ve been paid more I probably would’ve stayed working for them
good,"Worked part time during college and they were very flexible with my school schedule. The job is sales driven and there's always a push to sell more, get more people to sign up for credit cards, sell more accessories, etc."
good,"my job was a customer service representative i do returns and exchanges to customers , i help with sales and in other departements if they need me and if its really slow then i will be cleaning and organizing"
good,Bonne employs pour etudiant et premier employs dans le domaine de la vente et autre.
good,This company taught me a lot about costumer service in a new prospective. I was able to assist customers with issues they were having with their electronic devices.
good,The job did not really require much. There was  not a lot to do. Most of the positions consisted of stocking product and working with customers. Returns were not especially difficult.
good,Good experience an enjoyable place to learn and grow enhancing and developing needed skills to proform during current and future roles as an efdective employee
good,It’s an ok job. Gave me better experience with talking with people. People were nice and employees were fun to work with. Some customers could be difficult but it’s easy to overcome.
good,I enjoyed working here. But I am looking to advance my career and this store doesn’t have that opportunity. When a possible position does come available it’s held out in front of you like a carrot. They want to see how bad you really want the promotion.
good,"I worked at Best Buy as a part-time, 2nd job. I started during the holiday season, and stayed for over a year. The environment of the store was great, it was positive and the managers did a good job keeping the employees engaged and were more than willing to work with them to help with work/life balance. The benefits for full-time employees are good, and the discount employees receive is amazing."
good,Best Buy was a great place to work. I learned a lot and developed a number of skills during my time working there. We had game nights that were lots of fun.
good,"Great company ."
good,"Was a great place, had a lot of fun and learned loads. Won several freebies from the training. Loved helping people. Only complaint was inconsistent shifts."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,It is a lovely place to work associates are awesome to work with it is a truly fun place to work holidays get crazy but that is when the fun starts. I have worked there for 5 year and i am hoping to transfer.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my employment at Best Buy.  I found the work there to be interesting and enough of a challenge to keep my interest.  I found the work culture and management supportive and the compensation competitive."
good,"Fun place to work, good benefits and discounts. Would recommend young kids to apply at besbuy for first job . Overall was a fun work experience, all fun n games."
good,"Great benefits for the job."
good,All in all it's a good company to work for. They have a great benefit package. The only thing is it is not a commission based company but they operate it as though it is.
good,"Good place to make a career if you get hired into a full-time position with company benefits, which turns out was difficult for me. The supervisor and management team was great!"
good,"I worked at one of the smaller stores and the culture around it was great. It was a work family."
good,"i liked working at best buy because of all the cool stuff im dealing with and the great customers."
good,I learn you gotta be friendly and of course generosity to  customer when they come to for help. The most enjoyable part of the job giving the customer a  reason to get the produce. Once they do I get promotion. There is not hardest part just enjoying work there and of course making money.
good,"Best buy was a good place to have a job, the pay was decent, the workers were great, and management was really nice and helped train for advancement within the company."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work if you have a strong work ethic. Everyone is hourly or salary so there’s no conmission, but there is potential for a monthly bonus based on hitting targets, and quarterly bonuses for management. Feels like working with family, everyone is very close. Sales targets can be difficult to reach at times, but definitely attainable. The company cares about its employees and customers and is always looking to improve."
good,"Great place to work, You will pick up on modern day electronics and pick up tools and techniques with customer service for every day use. Discounts are amazing for employees as well."
good,"It's a chill place to work, but the stores inside malls no longer exist. I can't speak to how it is at the big box stores. Good place to work, however."
good,I loved working at Best Buy. The management was very helpful in my training and was very flexible in giving me hours. The environment was very relaxed and fun to work in.
good,"Doing trucks can be stressful but as long as your team works together, it'll be fine. Otherwise, you'll be in the store for a while. The discount is amazing and the hours aren't so bad for me as a part-time. Management is alright  but their can be some improvement. Inventory gets all the backlash from management so don't try to screw up."
good,This job is great for college student. They are flexible as possible with scheduling and are very motivating. I have learned lots about sales and working on a large sales team.
good,"Best Buy is a fun, fast pace environment where we interact with many different demographics. Helping individuals with technology. The discount is great, and you can learn a lot."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Fun but lacking advancement opportunities - i enjoyed the people i worked with and getting explain all the newest and innovative technologies available to the public to each individual customer.
good,It was fun working there. One of my favorite jobd. They respect employees and offer grest opportunities. I was offered a position based off of performance within a month or two of being there.
good,Sale of appliances and accessories. Provide employee training and associate assessment. Control of department organization and budget responsibility. Display and product preperation
good,"I was selling to every type of person. People who didn't know and people who were serious about electronics. They were both great to talk to! I could teach the people who didn't know meanwhile ""nerding"" out with the ones that did. My coworkers were friends that I hung out with outside of family."
good,"Very good company to work with, management was great and respectful.  the only this was the pay wasn't great and you have to work holidays.  great experience."
good,"I loved working for GeekSquad. It was one of the best jobs I had ever worked. It could get stressful at times trying to sell plans to customers but there was never enough pressure to make me quit, just made me work harder."
good,"The atmosphere is pretty nice there. In Geeksquad you become a small family and you all learn together and lean on each other to succeed. the managers were decent most of the time some had their flaws, but mostly they were good."
good,The managers were helpful along with the supervisors with any questions with flexible hours and many hours to handout and the work is understandable with a lot of help.
good,greeted people as they walked in checked bags and receipts watched the cameras did walks around the store to make sure everything was secured and locked up at night
good,"It was wonderful being to able to call myself a stealth agent. Troubleshooting computer problems could be a hassle, but the end result was always worth it."
good,"The hours are fair ,the managers are fair and the benefits  where good the store had the right volume of customers that were friendly the staff was helpful and fun"
good,"I go to work."
good,"very organized fun and outgoing people. "
good,"Great place to work"
good,I would say this was a splendid company. The workers are all encouraged to increase their tech knowledge in order to provide the best and the least harrowing experience for the customer.
good,"In my opinion, Best Buy is a great place to work at. Typically, they'll have me change the prices, then I'll downstock the store, and finally do planograms. The hardest part is downstocking, since I have to look all over the store for products, while the most enjoyable is doing planograms, since I feel as though I'm orgranizing the store. The managers are really nice and dependable, and the store is like a family."
good,It pretty much open the door if you have a passion for technology. Enjoyed working on planograms and price adjustments on a weekly basis. Definitely enjoyed helping the customers for what they were looking for or planning to purchase products. A great overall experience with the company.
good,I liked working at Best Buy. I loved my coworkers and the culture of Best Buy. I like opportunity to grow as well as learn about new products in the tech industry. I also loved how flexible they were with my schedule.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Very positive environment. All the managers are very good and helpful. However, it is retail so you can do a lot of standing around. So if you are someone who likes to be doing something at all times like me, it my not be the best fit for you."
good,Depending on the store you work at you can have a great workplace culture where you can have fun while you work or have a place with managers that are always on you about how you are doing things and only focused on numbers.
good,"I truly enjoyed working at Best Buy, only leaving because of a better paying job, which in turn became seasonal. Not every Best Buy is the same though"
good,"Excellent company and fun workplace. "
good,Great job and great company.  I loved working there and I would go back if I had to.  They promoted me to full time geek squad as soon as they saw my skills in my job performance in other departments
good,"best buy makes sure the employees are in good shape and have a good environment to work in. once the employees are treated well, then they will treat the customers well and the store can then profut"
good,"In all my jobs before this one, I've never been happy to come to work every day.  Three years with Best Buy, and I still enjoyed my job.  If only there was room to advance from within..."
good,"Depending on which store you work in and management, Best Buy can be a really fun place to work at. You do have to care about your individual performance if you want to move up, but we do not work on commission so it can be hard to motivate employees to care."
good,In this job I would drive to meet up with other geek squad members to assist in the installation of certain appliances mainly TV’s but over all I would say it was a decent job other than gas mileage reimbursement which at the time was 50 cents a mile and considering I drive a truck that gets about 16 miles to the gallon they could have done better with reimbursement.
good,"demanding tech knowledge, daily stand-up meeting, process and procedure not well defined. pci compliance makes system access difficult, very cumbersome, needs streamlining. chef-staffed cafeteria, very good/inexpensive food. office in warehouse building, somewhat noisy."
good,First job after military.  They promote from within.  Motivate employees by  recognition program.  Quarterly bonus for all employees.  Monthly all store meetings
good,"I learned a lot about how to manage other employees"
good,this was a nice little job and the people where very friendly too. but on some day it as pretty slow and it seem to go on forever. but its nice to meet new people and the employees are chill
good,"Overall it’s a very good job if you want the sales experience. Another thing is the environment at my Best Buy is great and everyone is helpful. Discounts is another good thing that comes from working at Best Buy, so if you’re into different hobbies that require electronics you’ll benefit from working there."
good,"Not enough training but easy to catch on , most calls were about if best buy had a item in stock, had to always call Greensboro store and they never answered."
good,worked under Anderson was hired by best buy to do movie and music sale and inventory while assisting customers. Also setting up displays for future sales and having daily meetings with management as to the duties we that were to be done for the day.
good,"I know not every store is like my store, but Management for my store excelled at helping and developing its team. If you find yourself at a store with leadership like mine then there is no limit to how far you can go."
good,I loved every minute of working at Best Buy.  The holidays are fun because they are so fast paced and you are able to help people to better equip themselves for their holiday experience.  I loved learning about all of the changing technology and being able to have that hands on experience.  The work life balance is to be expected when working retail.  My GM was FANTASTIC though.  He listened and helped me grow to my potential.  He was someone I looked up to.  The whole company has many great people and you can build a whole other family within the company.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"There is teamwork involved in my department.  Everyone helps the other person complete the listed tasks.  I worked at Best Buy before, so some of my knowledge was helpful; but there were many people who were there to help me adjust after two years of being gone from the company.  The hardest part of the job was learning the new changes, the most rewarding part is when I get it right."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of area meetings, assisting customers, answering questions or concerns that customers may have. I've learned how to deal with difficult customers and workers."
good,"I work in DDC Support at Best Buy Corp.  We are a group of about 10 people. We work together as a team to support the 15 DDC locations across the USA. My daily tasks involve being the liaison/point person for teams to reach out to. I assist in inbound issues,  system(order) issues.  I also create and supply reporting to DDC partners and Corporate business partners.  I work with centers to create standard operating procedures.  I document processes and train them out to the field.  I also monitor the execution and expectations required by the field teams. I also partner with Finance , Marketing and Vendors on a daily basis."
good,"Favoritism, all the managers would choose a worker to get promoted or better hours based on who they like versus how you perform in the role you are given."
good,"I wish I would have stayed and taken the huge raise that was offered when I gave my two weeks notice. "
good,"If you like electronics and new technology products best buy is a fun place to work at. The only thing is, its a super dry environment so keep a water bottle handy snd eyedrops available"
good,This is a great starting out job for anyone.  There is a department for any interest.  They treat you fairly and work with your schedule.  I enjoyed my time there
good,"Geek Squad Culture is amazing. However once a Geek always a Geek, What that means is there is very little chance for growth. Fast paced and at times stressful."
good,Awesome work environment. Great company to work for. Great benefits. Always rewarding and encouraging!  Flexible hours and very understanding over everything.
good,I learned a lot about cell phones and the way they operated. I also learned a lot about the different cell phone plans that are available to customers. The hardest part of the job was having a customer walk away not happy because of a problem not being completely fixed or not having the right products on hand. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customers happy with their new device and understanding how to use it.
good,After a few years away from this job I think of what a great place it was to work in! The work it self was enjoyable helping clients was always the best part! of course if you were trying to help everyone you always got the odd one that would complain and make you look bad but for the most part the clients were pleasant and open to hear what you had to offer.
good,"Great place to work, Intense though when it came to dealing with upset clients. A lot of deescalation, and need tough skin. Go into work, print reports, check nps score, make sure all client computers are ready to be picked up for the day, check appointments for preparation of incoming clients. The hardest part of the job is when you are the only consultation agent and there is a line of 10 or more and they are all mad and you are dealing with a difficult client at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job, is seeing the gratitude on the clients face when they see their issue has been resolved and they can work on their device again with ease."
good,"good place to work if you are not the main source of income for your household. Great place to develop team work skills. Working with BBY  employees is easy and rewarding because you are all out for the same goal. The third party providers that contract with Best Buy are the number one problem with the company."
good,Shifts can change quite often as one is never on a fixed schedule.  Worked as an inventory specialist and it was almost always busy.  When we weren't looking for products to fill online orders we were stocking shelves or covering for security so they could take their breaks.  Fast Paced with friendly workers and managers.
good,"Best Buy in Newnan was one very well-run organization. I had the pleasure of working for Xavier and he was phenomenal and not only in training but making you feel comfortable on the floor as well as you had an open door at any point in time when you needed someone to talk to. Unfortunately I had to leave for personal reasons and I wound up moving out of state. "
good,"Pay not equal to high-level work being done. However; in order to get a higher paying job further in your career, those are the kind of punches you have to roll with for preparation and experience."
good,"This company pays fairly and had great benefits, especially for full timers. They start full timers off with 80 hours of pto immediately, then after a year they bump it up to 140 hours!"
good,Love working for BestBuy. Managers and supervisors are great. Very positive and active environment. Just wish the pay was better so I can live. Hope it can be fixed soon!
good,I had a wonderful time working at best buy everyone was awesome to work with  the management was excellent and were very flexible with what hours i could work.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I made lots of friends at this job. Your peers become your family, as you laugh at some of the stupidity of some of the people that come in (lots of people waiting last minute for Christmas presents). With any customer service roles, be prepared to have a person or two be upset with you when you cannot control it."
good,Good place to work for if you only want to work part time. Hard to move up to full time. Lot of work needs to be done but all and all good place but again if only intrested in pt.
good,"Not much to say, except it was a seasonal position for me, that turned into part-time, but still wasn't enough as far as the full-time hours I wanted. "
good,"Good place to grow, good benefits an very family orientated. Good place to work very clean an safe.i liked it cause it was close to home an everyone is very friendly."
good,"I worked in several different departments, started in audio, went to video and computers.  I was starting to learn appliances when offered a position with another company.  I also would come in to help unload the supply truck."
good,"I'm coming from a store that was rather broken and had a hard time getting together. I have been in several areas and found that they all function precisely the same, just a different product. That said, the management is inconsistent store to store and sometimes even within the SAME store. You can move from geek squad to Computing and see an entirely different attitude and approach to the company between the two. If management has done their job and is knowledgeable and cares for their associates as mine has so far, then this is a great place to work. Just be sure you are passionate about that Area, otherwise your usual ""I don't want to be here this place sucks"" attitude from part timers becomes infectious."
good,"each department has a lot of trainings, enviroment is excellent and very costumer friendly, holidays are the busiest days ever, has good employee benefits overall."
good,Best buy is one of the best retailers to work for especially if you are a college student. It is a very rewarding job with flexible hours. The only downfall is having to work on Thanksgiving day but that is the busiest day of the year and it brings in lots of revenue to keep the doors open.
good,Working at Best Buy was a great experience especially because im in to technology and the latest gadgets. The environment was great and my peers were very friendly and helpful. The management was fair and just love to see a dedicated worker on their side. I also loved the interactions with my customers because I love to help people find what they need.
good,Fun place to work but management can use a lot of work. Pay is descent but need more to live on your own.working on thanksgiving isn’t the best but you get use to it. Discounts are good as well.
good,Every employee was treated with respect and treated the same. I found it interesting how they treat the new employees the same as the ones they had before
good,Loved it. I had a great experience. Great place for students to work. It was fast pace and it was cool to see the latest ad greatest in technology. Would do it again
good,The culture of Best Buy is very pleasant. Excellent coworkers and good leadership. You are surrounded in a technology wonderland that brings out the curiosity in everyone
good,Fun energetic work days with something/someone to learn from daily. The overall experience and culture is amazing. The hardest part about the job is the first month or so trying to learn each department if you do not know anything about technology. The most enjoyable thing about Best Buy is meeting all the customers daily.
good,"A typical day at work involved:"
good,"As a repair technician, I always challenge myself to complete the difficult problems. The company’s business in that nature. They also have to compete with others and the advance of technology put them in trouble"
good,"Great company, plenty of advancement and opportunities to grow within if that's your choice as long as you work for it. Only real complaint is the management sometimes arent the best group of people"
good,"I've always wanted to work for Best Buy since I was a kid since that's where my family did most of our shopping for electronics, and other mobile devices. Although, I just had a seasonal position, I really enjoyed working there and would be willing to gain employment there again in the near future. I worked with a bunch of cool guys, and my manager was super easy to work with and understanding if I had things come up and couldn't come in. The only reason I didn't get a full time position after having a seasonal position was because I worked for a smaller Best Buy Mobile, and wasn't able to be fit into the budget for the store since it was smaller."
good,I learned the most in customer service and the importance of product knowledge while at this job. Very hands on and educational training as well as great discounts and picking up tech tricks
good,"Best buy has taught me a lot about business and technology. I can recommend this company to work at for pretty much anyone. Depending on the store that you work at, management can be really fun to converse with."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I loved to work for them I loved the atmosphere and culture of the environment, I just had to work for college and for money reasons. but with resent financial troubles that they are have at the moment I wouldn't count on having a job for much longer"
good,This was a decent job. I learned a lot from being here. i met a lot of friendly co-workers. I loved my managers. I had pretty good hours every week and great pay.
good,"Great place to work while in school, flexible schedule can accommodate anyone. The benefits include a competitive pay and great discounts so if that interests you i would check it out."
good,"employee discounts were great, i wanted more hours, but they didn't have them available for me or i probably would have stayed longer i just couldn't live off part time."
good,best buy was a good hold over job to work while in school but offered little advancement for my role. The work was easy and the managers were nice enough so no real complaints but not an outstanding job in any regards.
good,"I liked Best Buy and most leadership there. I had a certain issue with one, but I can't say its a bad company because of one bad egg. Fun job most of the time but dealing with customers can get stressful time to time."
good,They offer a lot of different training and there are plenty of opportunities for advancement. I learned how to figure out exactly what each customer needed. Management was very flexible with employees.
good,"a typical day at work is very fun & interesting"
good,No I Don't want to do this. but i have to had more characters apparently. this is really dumb but whatever. I don't care enough about this place to do this.
good,"work was simple, however hard workers will get passed up in favor of friendship. leadership was a crooked as a rainbow. word of advise, don't kill yourself to be the best. management will overlook it every step of the way."
good,"The job was great, it created an environment that pushed me to become a better person. It made me try to find ways on how to become better salesmen in the process"
good,"I enjoyed my time at best buy. I was good at selling, so I was never in managements crosshairs reguarding that, but I was repremanded for taking too long to find the right fit for customers at times. As long as bestbuy continues to do well by its customers, it's a great place to work."
good,"This is a fun and interesting place to work if you love electronics and the latest technologies.Best part of the job is to help and coach customers about their new  products. Most trying times are when the amount of work staff is not able to adequately service the number of customers, ie holidays and big sales promotions."
good,"I loved working for Best Buy and still do on the seasonal side when I am able, as they are flexible with your career it's always made it east. They want you to succeed in whatever you do, and not many companies can say that."
good,It is great to deal with new different people every day and learning new skills is amazing. I have gained more confidence through this job and my managers
good,Tienen muy buena comunicación con los empleados el ambiente laboral se presta para que el equipo trabaje en conjunto ya que hay mucha experiencia en la tienda capacitaciones contantes tienen muy bien definidas su cultura hacia el empleado lo que no me gusto fue que es muy difícil el crecimiento y lleva de mucho apoyo con tus pares.
good,It was a great fun place to work at. With amazing co-workers and benefits i would recommend it for anyone who simply enjoys being on the cutting edge of technology.
good,Working at best buy was one of the better jobs i have had in my adult life.  Most of the other employees are fun and engaging and had many opportunities to make lasting friendships.
good,Best Buy is a great place to work if you want overtime and early shifts. I didnt have the best experience with my co workers mostly because everyone just want to get there work done!
good,"dexterity and effeciency are needed to work in the merchandise department."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,It was a good job as far as retail goes it was more technology driven. There is never any slow time as you have non-stop training on the computer when your not doing other tasks. It some good training modules to keep you constantly learning and educated about the products and customer service quality training.
good,Wish I could've stayed and been hired in. Was a temporary worker with potential to be hired in. Everyone was helpful if you asked for help and really was a cool place to work.
good,Fun place to work and learn new things management was decent and they worked around my schedule with my other job got employee of the month twice and had free lunch on them also went to a sales orientation to introduce you to Best Buy and learn about your department which I thought was really different then just sticking you out there and saying good luck! Which iv always had a problem with with other company’s. But yeah overall not bad place to work.
good,"Welcome to Amazon's show room. The place people will walk into to look at an item and walk out with nothing. Black friday should be eliminated from existence and so is the unnecessary need to get every single customer to purchase GSP. You're not winning unless every single customer has GSP on their purchase. Why not include it in the cost of the item itself? MONEY. The discounts really aren't worth it unless you worked there over a decade ago and had awesome managers who hooked you up with open box items. Otherwise, the perks are that you're working around new electronics(if you're into that sort of thing) and you aren't getting paid bare minimum wage, especially if you have experience with computers, tvs, etc..."
good,Upper management was nice and kind however there was a member or two of lower management who didn't show compassion at a time when I needed it. I found It slightly annoying to have to constantly wear the earpieces that I didn't find comfortable/fitting.
good,While working at Best Buy it was easy to consider it a second home because of all the great employees I got to meet over the years of working there. Happy work life creates an environment that you want to strive in.
good,"Best Buy gives you the opportunity to build strong sales and customer service skills while not pressuring commission based compensation, but being fairly compensated."
good,"We always had some kind of fun, the job was very fast pace with a lot of internation visitors, and hours could at some seasons be very difficult to come by."
good,"Best Buy had a great Intern program. It was well thought out and full of fun activities to balance work and play. We got to go to a Twins game, out to dinner, and even got to meet the CEO. A typical day was  fast-paced, collaborative, fun, and challenging. They have a great office space that balances work and play."
good,Veery calm job to work for if looking for quick the employees ............. are very nice wonderful people great people. managers are cool also will work here in future.
good,people are great to work with.learning experience was great.  training was great. i worked at 3 different locations 2 off malls and 1 big best buy and all were great.
good,"This is a very fun place to work, you will meet a lot a great people. The company doesn't pay excellently and a lot of your ability to get promoted is based on being in the correct position at the right time. But overall a good workplace."
good,"A Typical day at work consists of managing a work bench of several computers and iphones. I repaired hardware and software for computers while working with co-workers to hit quarterly and monthly goals such as revenue and the NPS metric. The hardest part of the job was learning how to keep up in the face paced environment, but this was also the best part."
good,good job if you are a go getter. you will never have the same day twice. always room for advancement if you are wiling to move. management from top down is focused on the same message
good,"Working at Best Buy is great. You get to play with the newest high tech items and learn all about them. I have learned so much about technology from working at Best Buy. Management is usually good and understanding with little things in life pop up. The hardest part of the job is how repetitive it can be, especially on a slow day. The best part of the is working with great people and seeing the friendly repeat customers."
good,"Good place to be at.Great atmosphere with customers.Active environment and great ""team player"" assistance.Great interaction with fellow store associates and managers, GM's.Treated people coming into the store like they were friends, not customers and built a huge friendship base that still stands even after i left due to medical reasons.They still come in ask how i am doing and such.Makes me feel great in knowing they feel that way.People there at the store feel the same too.Lasting impressions tell something great about someone.Do miss it though."
good,Overall experience working at best buy for 2 years has shown me new ways to advance but it slowly takes a toll on you when you see pay is not the best
good,"As a delivery driver I was always out and about doing my job, I have learned quite a few tricks with moving appliances.  The management on the geek squad side was good, the store lacked in support though.  The geek squad has such a good culture around it and i wish more places were on their level.  The most enjoyable part of this job was going to peoples houses and making their day by delivering their now stuff!"
good,I liked working for best buy. I worked for the company for 3 years while I was in college. I really forced me to be customer driven and build a relationship with customer.
good,"I enjoyed the job and coworkers but limited room for advancement if you aren't ""the favorite"" but other than that it was a good place to work at. not for a career in my opinion."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,the culture is great because of their openness to hiring a diverse group of people which leads to so many different personalities and fun during the job. managers are inconsistent and sometimes detrimental to employees growth.
good,good starting out job that can lead into a career. flexible scheduling and friendly culture to work and thrive in so long as you can adapt to your job.
good,"Working as a Geek squad agent makes you feel distinguished from other people, there is a lot of Geek Squad culture such as having a badge ceremony when earned."
good,"Working at Best Buy was a great job experience. Allows the training of all different aspects of not only sales but what you are selling. Their is both on the job, as well as, computer class training. Friendly environment. As with all sales jobs there will be nights were you have to do inventory and price checks. It is relatively simple however and you are paid for all hours put in."
good,It was tough to move up due to favoritism. But people were like family which I loved. I did my best and things were difficult but I kept at it. Certain managers were amazing.
good,A typical day at work is usually talking with and helping customers with their products or in buying new products. You learn a lot about the new technology's coming out and the general trend of consumer electronic consumption. The management is really helpful and want employees to grow and learn within the company. The hardest part of the job is the rush hours when too many customers want service and there aren't enough employees to meet demand. The most enjoyable is when you have time to really understand a customers needs and wants in a product and are able to match them with something they truly desired.
good,One of the better retail jobs there is. Flexible hours for part time and full time employees. Fun place to work at and fun people to work with. Employees are very diverse.
good,"Best Buy is a fun and interesting place to work, and you get a good discount, but sometimes you get overlooked for promotions when you should have definitely gotten it. Overall though, it’s a lot better than most retail stores to work at."
good,"even though it was mainly janitorial work, I enjoyed my time there. However it was very inconvenient when I tried to get a new job at another Best Buy and they didn't hire me even though I was told I would. 8/10"
good,Worked here for 20 years so has to be a good place to work right? Overtime offered at certain times of year. Working every holiday gets old after all these years
good,I have always loved it from the gecko things just got bumpy for me an my family so I had to move forward in life I learned a lot memorized A LOT an on top of all that I think that 1187 Best Buy store is the BEST Best Buy store of all time!
good,"Hardest part of the job was getting stuck after hours, also after Christmas as a part time agent there were barely any hours. However I really enjoyed working there, I was able to meet a lot of really fun outgoing individuals and I enjoyed making a difference in my customers lives."
good,"The culture and coworkers you work with are fun and positive. Operations department needs a little bit of work with management but is still descent. You will learn to work a till and handle customer inquiry but beware you'll be doing a lot of self teaching about products. Aside from a friendly environment, discounts for products are a huge bonus. Overall, a great place to work at if you're looking to improve on providing amazing customer service."
good,Fun environment great discount for employees. Training is very comprehensive they will show you everything you need to succeed at the job management is great along as you do your job.
good,"I am part time at best buy and the reason I will stop working there is because I requested full time and they claim there is not enough work, I can perfectly work 40 hours"
good,There is not much I can say about best buy. Other than it was a great job. The Manager were super nice and friendly and there twitter even sent me out a goodbye tweet.
good,"it was a good job, lots of things to do. Customer support is a big part of working there. Sometimes its hard to lock stuff but after you learn it gets better."

good,"Un día típico de trabajo, generar reportes, gestionar a vendedores a mi cargo, servicio y atención al cliente y atender necesidades internas de personal."
good,"it was a decent place to work, although the location I worked at I believed played favorites. But they do offer discounts and my coworkers were pretty friendly."
good,fair and decent company. was able to move up and get desired position. managment was capable and all employes had fair chances. fun place to work and teamwork was a real value
good,"Anytime there was a particularly hard day, like a big sale such as black Friday, the management would provide food in the employee lounge for everyone to eat. The largest problems were when corporate would not let them assign enough employee hours to actually finish the work."
good,You have to be a good salesman to work at Best Buy. The management team is focused and dedicated to meeting corporate metric requirements. In doing so store management treats you with respect while also asking a lot of you.
good,"productive and fun workplace, learned how to be more professional, management was always involved and available in any type of service, hardest part of the job was switching schedules and getting used to the start time, and enjoyable part was that everyone was treated like family."
good,Everyone is friendly there. Have to know what your talking about after all the trainings you complete. Managers are on top of everything and know what they are doing
good,Great place as a started job. Taught me many thing in the business world. Helped me leap into the work place with lots of knowledge and prepared me for some of the dealings of my current job.
good,it was a place where you must move with haste and must be ready to receive and deliver orders at any time. you must be on your feet while your on the clock and must help customers if they need help
good,The Work day was always productive. Due to the type of work I was preforming We had a lot of freedom but also had to remain on task to make sure jobs got done in a timely matter for the Customers.
good,"It was a pretty good job, i definitely enjoyed working for this company. i learned a lot of different things, i learned a lot about technology and team work."
good,I was a part timer and full time student. Definitely a great place to work as a student or as a first time job. You get to play and learn about  all the new tech which is pretty cool.  Very flexible.
good,Best Buy does a really good job on training. They are costumer service driven. Best Buy gives you the knowledge to succeed whether it is in life or work. They help you grow for personal and professional.
good,"I worked at Best Buy for a short amount of time because it was seasonal. However, management was kind as well as staff. The break room was an actual break room with tv, lounge couches, and a snack machine. Working here definitely was an overall good experience."
good,Managers were very flexible with my school schedule. I have gained a lot of knowledge and skills along the way. This is a fun and a great place to work.
good,Very helpful staff and good selection of product. They price matched and also showed interest in helping introduce us to other items. Overall good experience and the Camera purchased was a great deal! Would suggest Best Buy to a friend for purchasing a DSLR.
good,"Best Buy is an amazing fun work experience and ranges from awesome co-workers to great managers, and best of all has some sweet benefits to go with good compensation for the work that you do."
good,"best buy was my first job where I learned the fundamentals of running a business and managing a team. For a retail company, you get a lot of corporate structure once you take a management position"
good,"Best Buy provides the tools to be exceptional and the ability to teach yourself parts of the job. The management can be a little uncoordinated and small favorite groups can pop up. "
good,Starting at 10$ a hour is not a bad policy at all. As well as generally  learning a technical trait while on the job that can be passed on into another work field.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy was an amazing job! I always wanted to work there so all of the job and it's benefits was great for my family and I. The job is fast paced, great team collaboration, and professional."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, the only issue is the compensation. Other than that, best buy was an amazing employer. I would enjoy working for them again."
good,"Best buy is a decent place to work at. This discounts were really the only thing I looked forward to instead of my paycheck. The only way a person could get benefits was to be a full time employee and that was a really hard position to get. Also, could only get tuition reimbursement for school if you were full time as well"
good,The workplace culture is fairly employee focused with minimal but essential management intervention. Many times they promote from within to fill management positions and cross train for added employee value.
good,"The store I worked at was a second family, our GM at the time pulled me aside and asked about my future, she was a driving force for me to return to college after our store had closed. This company was very supportive of the decision I made to the point they told me to talk to them once I was finished."
good,Good Job. Would recommend. Managers are fun and laid back as long as there are no issues with your work ethic and you are treating customers properly.
good,"It is a fun, relaxed environment that is very friendly and helpful to many customers.  They have a very nice employee discount as well.  Training can be on going to help ensure employees are able to appropriately help customers."
good,"helps build customer relations, opens you up to be come more confident with dealing with customers on the daily. management encourages you to move up within the company"
good,"I wouldn't want to do it full time, but as far as retail establishments go, this one is not so bad. The managers are great, the culture is great, the pay not so much, and customers suck. But could be worse."
good,"I didn't work at Best Buy for long, but my time there was very enjoyable. Hours were very flexible, management was easily worked with for any sort of issue, and the overall working environment was very relaxed while also being competitive."
good,"People who work at Best Buy jokingly call it Best Buy High -- because it is a lot like high school sometimes. Like most workplaces, gossip spreads quickly. Nasty rumors were spread about me, and it really affected my job performance. Yes, many of us are in our 20s, but the Black Friday madness must have messed with their judgment. Or maybe they're just all immature."
good,"Fun place to work with opportunity for advancement , somewhat competitive pay, full-time employees have really great benefits. workplace culture is wonderful with focus on good work ethics. The hardest part of the job is working until 9pm, the most enjoyable would have to be the people and the work environment."
good,Waking up to a good team of well rounded individuals who not only work hard but like to have fun. I've learned a lot about interacting with different types of customers.
good,Management gave you the ability to be creative in finding solutions to issues & problems.  The workplace culture was very inviting and encouraged everyone to do their best.  Co-workers made the job fun.
good,Met all sorts of people here. It's a fun place to work but it's retail and so the hours are all over the place. Benefits were good and I loved the stock options.
good,Was fun to work at but there were times when you’d get written up for no doing anything when it was slow and everything was done. Other than that it was a fun experience for the most part.
good,Best Buy employees always seem happy around the costumers. They also make sure their hard work shows by how well kept the floor always is. They help anyone and everyone that could use it while in Best Buy.
good,Mobile department are a family. Management was very supportive. A lot on info to remember. and plans phone plans change a lot. Environment fun and exciting.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I worked along side other employees in the mobile department. I helped sell phones and accessories. From here i was able to move up in the company, to a home theater sales manager."
good,Gave weekly reviews to the store GM. Presented monthly one-on ones with sales associates. Worked daily on selling skills. Closed deals for associates. Responsible for keeping profit margins in-line
good,"Cut-throat but fun time always, everything needed to be done a certain way and if it wasn't done that way you had to fix it or completely redo it. Difficultly in learning the computer system for Geek Squad. Very nit-picky on everything."
good,Job is  stressful due to driving during peak hours. Angry clients too. There are times I can’t eat lunch so I can be with client on time. Some co-workers are hard to work with.
good,Best Buy is great for entry level. You will be trained and how to approach customers and how to make an efficient salesman. There is room for advancement but you need to be very patient and try to network in order to move ahead in the company. Make yourself valuable and you will be treated well.
good,"Best Buy is a technologically fast paced work place. You have to be 'in the know' to keep up, though there are many trainings that are given if you have the right management team. Best Buy is better at certain locations than others."
good,"I only worked part time while at college and during a holiday season. It was extremely stressful but it was definitely a good place to be at if you enjoy retail. They really have ladder that they encourage you to climb up and to continue doing well in the store/company. Great team work and great team to be apart of, as they are very encouraging and exciting when making a good sale."
good,"After working in multiple locations, I could feel the same values applied everywhere. The most visible was having fun while being the best, which is most applicable during the holidays."
good,I enjoyed working at best buy. It was competitive and I enjoyed the business culture. Customer Service and sales is something i also enjoy doing. Was a fun job
good,"It was a great company to work for. Work life balance is not easy starting at the GM level going up but many different things like employees, co-workers and the job itself makes it better!"
good,"I came into Best Buy as a Geek Squad Agent in 2014 right around the time they were beginning to restructure the company. Our CEO Hubert Joly really knows what he is doing hence the 30$-70$ market share increase in the past 4 years. Even at a store level most employees are great, most GM's and Sales Managers are great. The company was willing to work with me when I decided I wanted to relocate across the country. While I believe for part time employees they could do better with benefits they do offer excellent advancement opportunities, although sometimes you have to be patient. I was a part time GS Agent for almost 2.5 years before I was promoted to a full time lead in computing. The benefits are pretty good, I wouldn't go as far to say amazing but Health, Dental, Vision, Etc. for full time employees and paid vacation and sick days. They do have a blackout period from October to February so you cant really use your days off in that time unless it's approved way before. Black Friday is awful but I wont get into my views on that. To be honest best buy is a great place to get experience and grow, they pay their employees well, and the discount is amazing if you like your tech. I recommend it to anyone really even if you just want a part time job to make some extra money."
good,"Work was always quick. Some expectations may have been a bit high on slow days but for the most part they were fair. I would definitely recommend that job to most of my friends. Management was good at communicating expectations and very supportive. The most enjoyable part of the job was the culture, loose but focused."
good,"Worked for this company straight out of college and was impressed with the benefits, training, incentives, and respect they gave me as an employee. I worked as a Home Theater Installer and was able to advance quickly in my role, I was given great compensation, bonuses, company vacations and even company outings. Overall, I am actually sad that I couldn't have continued my career with this great company."
good,Typical work day mainly involves dealing with the customers. The general manager at the Clovis location wasnt perfect when I was there but he was good to some of us. Going through his replacement and the constant change in the work environment was difficult but I wish I would have stayed.
good,"It was a younger crowd working but everyone was very mature. "
good,"working here was cool , met great people , learned a lot , friendly staff , worked well with my school schedule , did team building events , received store gift cards"
good,Good company to work for. Great benefits! 
good,"What I like about the company"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Loved working at best buy.  I was never bored and it was always enjoyable to spread my love of electronics to customers.  Discounts were amazing and I got to play with the electronics I was selling.

good,Collective group of people with the same goals striving to create a culture of knowledge about technology and its use in modern society with a focus of culture and community.
good,"Received notice that all mobile stores would be closing down for good. Was compensated fairly but the entire process seemed to blindside everyone. Before this, environment and morale were great throughout the store. Sales numbers were constantly growing. Team members were wonderful."
good,sometimes they we not organized in warehouse with orders that needed to be del.also the sales people didnt sell customers the right product that i needed to complete or do some jobs

good,"Great team work and fun place to work. The discount was a perk for being part - time, since they do not cover part - time with any benefits. Career advancement was always an opportunity."
good,"Been working at Best Buy for 10 years, as far as a sales/customer specialist job goes it was a great experience. I've developed many skills such as interacting with customers, understanding how to find solutions/products to customers need/wants, and provided me up to date knowledge about new technological products. Workplace culture has always been demanding but very achievable, Managers been engaged into developing me with goals and skills. However, during my time there, I have been underpaid for the skills i posses and have gained (especially after graduating college). Newly employed associates might find starting salary to be generous but for someone thats worked there for 10 years, its not enough. Was not given option to even come close to the wage cap."
good,"Best Buy maintains a great culture of success even during difficult market times.  Their willingness to adapt and change in a tumultuous market helps maintain their consistency as a leader in the electronic industry.  As an employee you can expect to be challenged daily to excel in your current role as well as provide feedback to better service the customer.  The work can be challenging, and depending your position within the company it can make maintaining a health work/life balance tough, but it is rewarding."
good,"it was good fun place to work and relaxed i wish i didn't have to leave when i did it was a great place to work "
good,"In 2014, working at Best Buy seemed like a dream come true. I had just graduated out of high school, and I wanted to work in a location that felt similar to the field that I had, and still am, pursuing. (Programming-Computer Science) Training was excellent. Staff and higher-ups were wonderful to work for. The only thing that I could not oversee were the flexibility with school scheduling as I had been enrolled in school and working there at the same time. Due to this, I had no other alternative but to leave and continue with my academics."
good,"Best Buy is an excellent place to work. No complaints at all.Since I have worked there I have enjoyed learning more and more about this great company. They really are the company of the future with policies reflecting that. They promote from with in, get in the door and do good work and you will move up."

good,"Retail workplace is always challenging as you have to face different people and give your 100% despite all insecurities and circumstances of your life. I managed to learn not only about technology and operations, but also how to communicate in a respective, productive way. Best Buy has its perks as any company, however the coworkers and management are very helpful and friendly. My drive to learn and their professionalism helped me have a great experience."
good,"Exceed sales quota by 50% , Greet customers and assisted them in finding products. Replenish stock and cleaned work area.    Established strong customer relations. ​Engage customers in order to provide to them what they need."
good,I was a sales person at the front desk that sold geek squad protection to the customers. I would ask them how their day was and then try to build a relationship and make sure that they would buy the best geek squad protection for their product. The hardest part was customers having to come in and complain about not being satisfied with their product.
good,"Highly motivated, compassionate, and versatile professional, equipped with exceptional leadership capabilities complimented with comprehensive experience and a strong educational foundation in counseling within the criminal justice field."
good,What I learned was to interact with customers and how to approach them in different ways to be able to give them the best experience when shopping at Best Buy.
good,Very friendly atmosphere. Very easy to learn your job at your own pace due to patient management personnel. Management is also very good with doctor's appointments and school schedules.
good,Just like any other retail company you have sales goals and numbers to memorize. Overall good place to work if you want to move up into higher levels of management.
good,"I started off as a  ashier and through hard work, i moved up to senior level. This was a fun environment all around, but after 4 years it was time for me to move on."
good,I would go back there..i like the people there.. nice break room..clean work area..Good parking area all around the building..alot of loading and unloading.
good,Would recommend Best Buy to anybody. Great starting job. Nice benefits. Selling isn't terrible. I would return to the store if i had nowhere else to return to.
good,Greeted customers as they walked in. Found out as much information as I can about the costumers phone information to help the best I can. Learned to be quick and helpful on black Friday. Hardest part was not having security so we always have to watch our backs. Overall is was great working with amazing cool co-workers!
good,"If you are interested in a fun place to work, a place that continuously technology advancement, a place that provide variety of opportunities to advance your professional career, Best Buy is one of the companies you would like to work for."
good,"Bestbuy was a fun laid back place to work with the exception of a few days of the year that every retailer faces (black Friday, for example).  The managers are usually very understanding and relaxed.  I found the pay decent, the hours flexible and the people enjoyable to work with."
good,I enjoyed the management and structure that Best Buy provided. I was never made to feel that I was not apart of a team Best Buy allowed me the chance to try different departments to be better well rounded.
good,I personally enjoy working at best buy as a temporary job option. Great for college students and younger people. Pay could be better and not much room for advancement with company.
good,"Over 4 and a half years working at Best Buy/Geek Squad, the management and coworkers have been amazing and the experience with new technology is second to none. Being exposed to the newest technology coming out and repairing new PC models coming out every year along with other devices has given me experience that you can't find hardly anywhere else."
good,"Good place to get warehouse experience, great coworkers, and a good work environment. Always great to see new product. Getting to see the latest Tec is always interesting."
good,With Geek Squad Customer Care you are working everything as manager does and figuring out how to solve a solution.  The position is highly stressful and lot is required of you.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"A typical day at work involves clocking in , hopping on the forklift and picking up a few refrigerators,TVs , and other appliances. The management was very good and on top of their job ."
good,"* Easy job, simple rules to follow, fun environment "
good,"The people are nice, very instructive. Quick-paced environment and attention to detail is key. Always follow procedure and everything will go smoothly."
good,Les autres employés rendent le travail plus agréable mais l'évolution au sein de l'entreprise est difficilement envisageable.
good,As an asset protection associate there is a high amount of customer interaction. The culture of the work place allows for a fun easy-going environment that allows for the work day to pass.
good,"Out of all the jobs I’ve had, this one is probably my favorite so far. Working with the guys doing the warehouse is great. We all have the same attitude and get along with one another. I enjoyed working ad-set due to the fact that I feel like I was working at my own pace"
good,"Good management, listens to concerns. Job security and easy work for the most part. Lazy coworkers make more work for those that actually care about their job; the laziness is seen in both the warehouse and sales floor, excluding a few employees on both sides."
good,"It's a great place to work, but that depends on the store you are working in. If the store gets a lot of traffic you'll be busy and won't notice the day is over. Learned a lot about the product and selling skills. They want you to grow a a person and try to help, all you have to do is ask how."
good,It a job where you have to really know how to sell products to customers. The managers are caring enough to help with why you are not hitting numbers. So they come up with ways to try to help you out.
good,The culture and environment is absolutely amazing! But it is very clear to see that management has favourites when it comes to shifts. There is almost like a clique like environment with management and some employees. The pay could have also been better. Other than that it's an amazing place to work!
good,Best Buy is a relaxed environment to work in. I met a lot of good people there who I am still friends with. I left because I wanted more competitive pay.
good,"There are stores across the nation so you can move anywhere you want and transfer.   The pay is geared more towards entry level/younger folks and unlikely to make ends meet if you have many bills.  The environment depends on the managers, I happened to have great managers, but they still push to make sells and get credit card applications despite low foot traffic in store.  I would recommend this job to people fresh out of high school or needing a temporary job, as I said the pay is a little underwhelming."
good,"job was pretty easy. nothing was hard, had really good co workers who were willing to help. manager was also easy goin. really a stressless job and got to learn a lot"
good,It is a good palce to work. Everyone is welcoming and management is always willing to help. Hardest part of the job is probably dealing with the customers at certain times. However gaining customer appreciation is really rewarding.
good,"Amazing place experience at work. Management very help and caring. Great work life balance. Amazing coworker, made a lot of life long friendships. Best job i had."
good,"It's a good place to work. Employees and managers are fairly friendly, but scheduling around school is a nightmare during the holiday season, especially around the holidays. An average day is not usually too strenuous, and customers tended to be nice."
good,certain managers didnt seem to get along there was a lot of favoritism  some managers didnt want to work with your schedule  especially if you had two jobs
good,"get there grab your hand truck and start moving appliances ,get there to my table and start repairing"
good,"While I felt that best buy was a good overall company to work for, I felt that attempting to advance in some areas were extremely difficult. It seemed increasingly difficult to move from being a general merchandising representative. I attempted to move into different positions as soon as I could for advancement and was never given concrete information on how."

good,Retail services and customer service filled job. Great job for a young adult starting out. Recommended for first time employment or for some extra cash.

good,People you meet are great. The atmosphere is always fun even on busy days. Really its the employees that make the job worth while. Some days are tough when having to deal with rude customers. But in the end its just retail.

good,"Work as a seasonal contractor for Geek Squad through Apex Systems contracting, was a very good overall experience. Learned a lot about appliances, products, all while providing the customer with good customer service. Wish it lasted longer I was only seasonal, I basically got paid to ride around and barley do any work it was nice."
good,"It was a good job, unfortunately sometimes there wasn't any work and had to ask a manager to find work for you. Some days would be busy and some days we'd go hours before we start working."
good,"Sold products, Helped merchandise, Helped with security, worked with many great and enthusiastic people. The co workers really help you with every situation."

good,It was a good job with a great discount if you could wait a month. My job as a sales rep made the day go by faster than most because I wa always talking to people
good,"I got hired during the holiday season for an occasional/seasonal position in the warehouse. It was a fun, fast paced job, especially around the holidays. The team got along great, the management was cool. I had a good time. Only part that sucked is that we almost never were able to leave when we were scheduled to, sometimes staying up to 3/4 hours after we were scheduled to go. We were often understaffed in the warehouse which could get stressful. But overall, I enjoyed myself there."
good,You're paid to be trained in the newest electronics. I sharpened my selling skills through the training Best Buy provided. I had a very motivated team i worked with that set and met goals consistently.

good,was a really fun place to work and meet a lot of new and good people. the discount is what made the job worth it. would recommend to someone if they don't plan on moving up the latter any time soon.
good,had a great time working with people i enjoyed being around and our department was always number 1 or 2 in the district even though we were one of the smallest stores  then they broke us up and that department became more average
good,"After the holidays, your hours diminish if your set schedule too short "
good,La cultura que tiene la empresa se contagia desde que entras por primera vez.
good,Fast paced and competitive. Everyday was a little different and little exciting. Clients were a little annoying and demanding. Hours were not consistent.
good,I really enjoyed my time with working under the Best Buy branch really taught me the importance on staying on top of my numbers and giving great customer service.
good,Working with associates at BestBuy was enjoyable and made time pass quickly. Warehouse Supervisor and most upper management kinda unfair and showed favoritism.
good,"Working at Best Buy I dealt with a lot of different personalities as far as the customers, the job was laid back , you work at your own pace. Each day was different as the peak season started the work load got more intense, dealing with the different situations for each customer teaming up with the delivery teams so that the client would get a better birds eye view on there orders was some time challenging due to us contacted out of state teams. Over all it was a great experience."
good,"Progressive company filled with good people with good intentions. The history of the company is a must read and it's honestly very touching. A typical day at work consisted of clocking in and zoning my department. We were taught to approach every customer who steps foot in our department within the first 15 seconds. Walk them through the sale and establish rapport with the customer to ensure future business. We provide our expert knowledge and service through ought the entire sale. We wouldn't leave our customers side until they left the store. That was my favorite thing about the company, you actually build a clientele after some time."
good,"It was overall a fun workplace when you had the right crew working. It's almost impossible to get fired because of the job turnover rate, which led to some people getting away with almost anything. If you have the right management and team working, then it would make for a good day."

good,"when I started, I was offered a specific amount. After being there for quite some time, new hires coming in were getting much more than I had started at, or was even at currently. Advancement was nearly impossible for me, because of my religious commitments, because they required full time to be available all days."

They acted as if we were the company's greatest asset. They kept us informed, they were honest as often as they could be. They supplied great resources for future education and supported the employee's through out school. Really a great company to work for. The hours may be stressful, but they were there for you when you needed them to be and they supported you financially through all of your endeavors."

I met a lot of great people, and for the most part I agree with the ethics and the ideology of the company. I really came to respect the company as a whole for the most part, in terms of what I knew. Every Best Buy may work differently in terms of functionality but the commitment to customer satisfaction and experience is good.

good,Lots of great people. Love to interact with others. I basically get to talk about technology as my job. Selling helped get me out of my shell. It was always temporary but I think I'm going to miss the place
good,"This is my first experience with working in customer service as well as working period, therefore this job is very important to me also. This is the start of the growth that I would began to see within my job experience / professionalism."

good,When I first started back in 2011 it was an amazing company. They paid higher than most other retail jobs even though there was no commission. They would have vendor training and so many free giveaways but then they got a new CEO. He immediately capped the employee discount  and implemented several mandatory sales guides that interrupted the sales process that worked. Things settled back down a couple years later. Overall a good company with an amazing discount and vendor accommodations.
good,Typical day in mobile is dealing with complex customer solutions and troubleshooting of issues.  work with several different carriers to ensure best solution for customer.
good,"I typically stock,make sure the isles are good, no damages to shelves."

good,The overall attitude of the employees has always been kind. Everyone got along well with one another and tried to help one another out. Learned a lot of how well a store could be ran from here.
good,"une Valeur chez cette entreprise. Ceux-ci applique bien ce principe."
good,"I have worked at 3 different stores for Best Buy as a company. The first store where I was offered a job the management was great, the atmosphere was fun and made it an enjoyable place to work! The store I transferred to after moving to Tennessee wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best either. My expectations went down hill fast with management being late to respond to situations making things worse most of the time. However there was a few that would be fast and helpful when needed! The third store I transferred to had wonderful management and made me love my job again for the most part, but the other employees had a very cut-throat vibe, being in sale I lost most of my revenue because other team members would not give credit where it was due making it really hard to get my job done! I transferred back to the first store I worked at, with new management I lost all the hard work I put into working at the company. The new GM barely did his job the new sales floor managers are all over the place.  Depending on what store you work in and the environment, you will either love this job or hate it with a burning fiery passion!!"
good,"I enjoyed working there and since i was young and inexperienced, it was definitely a learning experience that taught me a lot about certain habits in a work place that i can use forever."
good,I like working at Best Buy... For working a retail it is not a bad job at all... I have been well taken care of by management. I would recommend Best Buy.
good,"La empresa es buena en general, cuenta con personas capacitadas y recibes capacitaciones cada cierto tiempo para mantenerse siempre con lo último en tecnología."
good,We would start the day with a group meeting and the group tasking. I learned that the team work was the best in that kind of environment. My first group of managers were awesome but the new management was shifty. I really enjoyed the job until the change but overall we had a blast.
good,"Store was fun to work for, great friends and learned a lot. Lot's of hands on training and team work, Pay was the only let down working for best buy.  ."
good,Its a fast pace environment that allows you to learn as you work. You will love the experience if you are a people person and do not mind helping others accomplish what they need in order to be successful with their task. moving up can happen quickly if your dedicated to your job at hand.
good,"During holidays I would pick up shifts and the opportunity gave me great insight on professional customer service. I have been in high intensity situations with days like black Friday in retail, you learn to adjust quickly."
good,"I started working there when it was Future Shop. I was working with a wonderful warehouse team. We would receive shipments, sort them into their departments, and put them out into the store. We would also merchandise the departments, making sure that everything was to plan and looking good for the customers. Management was wonderful to work for, and everyone had a great sense of humour. We would often play pranks on each other, and knew how to have fun and still get our work done quickly and safely. The hardest part of the job was probably making sure that the large truck shipments got sorted and put out into the store before the end of the shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the wonderful team that became a work family."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I must say working here is a great place to work. However the advancement is more based off of the typical political view, or the who knows who dynamic. Not qualifications or effort placed forth by employees."
good,"Off load trucks, separate product from onw pallet to another. Use a hand held RF (AS400) to receive the product into the warehouse. Match all the paper work to each truck and pallets. Make sure nothing was damaged, or need to have to fill out extra paper work for anything that was over, damaged, or short. Safety, multitask, and pay attention to detail was necessary."
good,"Spent most of my time talking with customers, stocking shelves, selling warranties and interacting with other employees. A great first job for someone looking to get into sales."
good,work was consistant until labor came into question and they try to fire you for time theft bc they need to cut pay roll outside of tht was a decent job helth care was great
good,"reviewing goals that need to be met for that day. Making sure my product knowledge is up to date throughout my department. At the location I worked didn't have for the most part the most eccentric customers. nonetheless, the work place was fun and I enjoyed going in each and every day."
good,"Started as part-time sales, moved into full-time, got promoted to team leader, now supervisor. More advancement opportunities have come up, and if you're willing to relocate, they come up often."
good,"Was a fun job with a lot of opportunity for advancement if you wanted it, if not, it was and easy to job to come in for during the week to make money, something for everyone."
good,In a day review of selling skills and maintaining a moderate level of work even without customers to provide excellent service. Very customer oriented and friendly coworkers.
good,I enjoyed the work environment provided by best buy because it was very to the point and being well trained took the guess work out of everything. not only was it easy assisting guests in my own department but best buy made it easy for all employees to learn about to entire store.
good,"fast paced, good team members, management was great.flexiable hours.competitive pay.long breaks which i did nit have to rush to eat.will recommend to anyone"
good,"A great place to work. Fast paced environment. Traveled to different stores weekly, so I never got bored just being at one store. I learned to appreciate the work I accomplished at the end of the day."
good,Fun place to work meat new people and do what you want to do.Learn new and exciting options about new and upcoming products. Get to work directly with customers.
good,"Some days open or closing shifts, stand at front, greet customers, guide them to departments, call for employees to contact customers,Hardest part is to watch cameras when you're trying to watch a person, customers will walk in and interrupt what you're doing, they end up distracting you from your job and could cost you. Management is great. Pay is the absolute worst even if you have a lot of work experience, most people do not work long here..."
good,"I had a fantastic time at Best Buy Mobile. The environment focused on team dynamic, sale techniques, and strengthening customer relationships. I really enjoyed managing the sales team and training new employees."
good,"Great people at all levels of the company - everyone is supportive of each other and has a great time together in accomplishing the mission."
good,"Typical day I would come in and load my truck with anything from appliances to small electronics. Deliver all my products and fully test out that the product works as intended and walk the customer through step by step. When I would go back to the store with whatever time for the day I had left would be spent doing inventory, receiving UPS and Fedex packages or setting up displays using Planograms."
good,"El lugar como zona de trabajo esta muy bien, en cuanto a instalaciones, con comedor y baño para solo empleados, buen seguimiento de problemas y soluciones prontas."
good,"Decent place to work at for a first time job. Flexible hours, great for if you are going to school. Compensation is decent as a student that lives at home."

good,"Inventory Specialist – November 2014 to January 2016"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Good place to work, they take care of you as long as you put the work in. Downside is if there is a not enough employees (there's pretty high turnover in my store due to student hires) you will be scheduled mandatory overtime and expected to work. They also think of this as a gift to the employee who may or may not want to work 48 hours+ a week."
good,"Interact with customers and talk to them about solutions to their tech needs. I learned a lot of cool things about technology that I never knew before. The management at the 2 different stores I worked at was great and always cared about you as an employee. The culture is great as well, always company events for the whole team to hang out and relax after work, sometimes we go bowling as well. The hardest part of the job is not letting the 6 month retail environment get to you and to keep the drive to move up to supervisor/manager postitions. Loved learning about all the technology and seeing how the different departments are becoming connect with newer technology."
good,"provide daily customer service, take returns and exchanges. try and make sure customer leaves happy and satisfied, customer excperince is number one. enage and connect"
good,It was a honor to work for one of Best Buys best stores which is 281 located in RichFiled MN. It helped me learn new products fast and be able to present then in a timely fashion for up and coming clients.
good,"The culture was fun and fast. Management was great. Pay was decent, but sometimes sales goals were ridiculous. Especially on a random tuesday afternoon when the store was dead."
good,Work hours were not fun. Always had to deal with targets that managers give and there was always a bad day when those targets were not met. Great people worked there though.
good,Team environment is highly emphasized here. Teams are encouraged to work together to keep production numbers up and minimize downtime for laptop/PC repair. Team leads are very helpful and put their teams best interest first. Work culture encourages a friendly atmosphere in which is welcoming to new employees. Team members are respectful and encourages simultaneous growth.
good,"As a semi-retired individual, this company has offered me flexible hours in a very good working environment. The managment staff is knowledgable and proactive with their employees and customers."
good,"Muy buen ambiente, aunque no del tanto, por mucha presión y no se toma con tranquilidad, Pero las personas son de confianza."
good,"A very micromanaged workplace treated like little kids, Its hard to get a raise also the managers dont hire from within when there is a lead position open."
good,Really great place to work if you love selling! the work culture is very enthusiastic and you get to work with technology all day which is pretty fun!
good,It's a great workplace to be in. Very friendly staff and easy to get along with. As a full-timer shifts are at the utmost priority for the leadership team as they want their full-timers to lead by example.

good,"It has a great work environment ,  friendly staff, great discounts. the hardest part is work life balance. That depends on the manager you have at the time. the stock options are also a good value"
good,"This company was not a bad company when I was there 5 years, raises were good, employees seem to like working there. until new management came in and starting laying a lot of people off.."
good,"Worked there for 6 yrs and loved every minute. Great pay and great people. Would go back. The only reason i left, was after being there for 6 years, I wanted to move up and it was hard for me to do so and I feel that they made it harder then it needed to be."
good,"Best Buy is a really good company to work for to begin your sales career. Good opportunities to move up in the company as well. Unfortunately with internet sales destroying sales for stores like Best Buy, I don't see them being around for too very long."
good,"The company is good to work for and has many great benefits i.e. training, employee discount. Management is spotty depending on the store you work in but all in all everyone I've come across has had a good heart and sincerely wants to help. Huge company focus on building within. Relatively easy to climb the ladder, and its a great chance to see how retail really works, with a company invested in always improve its products and its people. Your balance of work and life can be severely impacted once you step into a leadership role, that was the biggest downside to an otherwise great experience."
good,"Pay is good. Job isn't rocket science. If you do your job and do what you gotta do, you will be fine. You have goals daily/weekly/monthly that you have to hit but it isn't hard if you put your all into it."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.

Giving them a piece of mind and assurance that they are buying a good stuff with the backing of an excellent warranty.Working at Best Buy is a good experience with every member of the team working to a common goal.
good,"this was a great high school job, worked with my schedule well. It taught great skills such as being knowledgable about many different products, facing challenges, and rush hour. Management was great at teaching skills and having a positive environment."
good,easy work and fun environment limited opportunity for advancement and typical big corporate feel. too much protocol and not enough personal touch on the employees.
good,Best Buy is a great place to work while in school. They are very accommodating with your school schedule and if you are full time you have great benefits.
good,"Company has a lot of very good benefits. It is really difficult to move up which is slightly disheartening. The team makes the difference! Th people I have met through working here have created a solid professional network for me, whether it be customers or Co workers!"
good,"Best Buy provided a strong bench to train from and provided constant learning opportunities and growth. The company is great  in providing a team structure and promoting from within,"
good,There is too much to do for around 14 an hour. Getting yelled at by frustrated old people and constantly teaching them how to use the basics of a computer tends to get tedious. When you're alone and there are a dozen of people in line all wanting you to fix their computer right then and there is stressful.
good,I love working here.  It is a great company with a great culture and environment.  I always look forward to work and the hardest part of my day is driving to work

good,The company provides a wonderful environment of learning and customer centricity. Advancement within the company made easy by the coaching and training from the mangers.
good,"I loved working at best buy, however from store to store each one differs quite a bit. Working at the one in Seattle was more about who you know versus what you know. However the one in Boise was about leveraging your abilities to help grow the store."
good,"unloading trucks,"
good,Best Buy is a high energy environment. It is fun to work here. The company spends a lot investing to employees to ensure that they are happy. Best Buy believes that happy employees create happy customers.

good,"Loved working at Best Buy mobile in the mall."
good,"Strong values based company - long hours -- but rewarding.  Ability to move up in the ranks if you are willing to put the time in and work hard.

good,Best Buy is a really cool job to have. There are many different electronics made everyday and we get the chance to demo them to our customers. The expressions on their faces be priceless.
good,"Co-workers from all departments are very helpful, fun and knowledgeable. Anytime you need help, there is always someone to help with open arms. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning about new technology and speaking with customers. The hardest part is not always being able to help customers find what they are looking for."
good,Best buy is a very caring employer with employee friendly policies and offer excellent  work life balance.The team I worked with was very encouraging and supportive.

It was a friendly environment and the corkers were great! I would recommend Best Buy to everyone for a first job."
good,"I've enjoyed the majority of my time at BBY and the times I haven't have usually been caused by things outside what one can control; third party companies or customers for example."
good,"Best Buy is a great company to work for.  In a full time position you get fair pay, 40 hours a week, paid time off, and insurance.  The management and team is friendly and made up of great people ."
good,This is a great company to get a foot in the door. Management is great at times but they need to be great all the time. Some of the staff need greater motivation.
good,"It was nice working here. Everyone was always helpful and nice. There wasn't ever a day I did not enjoy my job. Of course, I had this job before I started a family and had kids. So now as a mom and wife, I would not do this job. But for someone who enjoys a fun environment and doesn't mind the odd hours, its a fun job and they are always open to letting you learn more.

good,Just do your job and its easy. Its retail so its nothing too hard. Talk to the customers and as long as they are satisfied so will your boss. It's a great job to have as a high school student.
good,It was a great experience working with a team again.  Taught me how to manage my time and productivity.  The management team was understanding and very cooperative with my scheduling. The hardest part of the job was figuring out the new equipment and understand new objectives.  The most enjoyable about the job was helping people figure out what they needed with out breaking their pockets.
good,It was super competitive but a fun place to work. I wish the pay was better i would have stayed but i learned a lot while i was there. I think it's a great place to start a career in sales.

good,"Most of my time at work was spent asking customers if they needed assistance with anything. Most of the time someone would say ""no"" and I would move on to the next person. I enjoyed the job because I like learning about technology and informing people about certain products. There is a degree of freedom when it comes to how you work. Most customers you deal with you can handle on your own unless they're being rude or pushy. You never really need to call a manager to help you out with anything because most things you can just do yourself which is good."
good,"If retail is your preferred form of work environment then there is no better place to work than Best Buy. The tools you use on the job are modern and up-to-date, and the environment is not overly competitive. It is not slow paced and does not provide room for laziness, so it is best for those who are driven to help customers and have a job that keeps you on your feet. Working weekends is usually must, at least Fridays and Saturdays, and you'll most likely work Thanksgiving and Black Friday."
good,"If you know your stuff with the department you got hired into it is a blast. Easy work because they give you the training videos on the things in the store, so if you do not know it best bet there is a video for it. Pays well and you get to hang around with the coolest people."

good,"I have been at Best Buy a year and a half. The environment is super relaxed, but the company demands results when the opportunity arises to sell. The people and customers are friendly, management team is knowledgeable and approachable, the pay is competitive and the discount is incredible. I enjoy working at Best Buy."
good,Typical day is helping customers with products or services. You have to learn what best buys services provide so that you can educate customers on how it is helpful for them.
good,"Was a fun and informative work place, but had a lot of necessary deadlines. The managers were reliable and assistance was also ready and available whenever needed."
good,A very diverse culture.  Would deal with plenty of different customers everyday looking for anything from making big ticket purchases on tvs and sound systems to someone coming in to find the right cable to connect devices.  This job helped me learn a lot about customer service and about the new gadgets and media out in the market today.
good,"Like any retail establishment, work schedule is demanding. But if you thrive on team engagement and sales goals, this is the job for you. I feel like benefits could be better. But you get a company match for 401k. I just wish my hourly pay was more."
good,"handling merchandise Regulated inventory levels and submitted inventory reports"
good,"Tons of chances to expand your knowledge of a certain department. weather its gaming, computing, home theater, or mobile phones you can always learn a lot about your department.  For someone like me I always like to learn more and more. So this job is a great place to be proficient with the basics of whatever department you are assigned."
good,"Number one thing I've learned was to have patience when dealing with people. Every server would have a section of the room to take care of for the whole night. It was our job to take care of the food, drinks, and people. I liked working with the people there, everyone lends a helping hand to get the job done. Hardest part of the job is you have to be quick and make sure you get every order correct. This was my first job and I learned how to work in groups and under pressure."
good,"Good place to learn the methods and standards for retail sales, great environment and a good corporate community. I had a lot of fun working with best buy, but the pay was low in comparison to commissioned retail sales"
good,"It was a friendly fast paced environment. They truly cared about everyone and there was plenty of room for growth and advancement, It was a very good expirience"

good,The culture at best buy taught me a lot about working with others in a fast pace. We competed for higher numbers per month even thought there was no real compensation for doing better at the job. It was just fun over all.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Great place to work if you love talking to new people, but also be able to sell. Management is pretty lenient with schedules and is there for you most of the time."
good,"Best Buy is a fun place to work, as long as you do not need a high paying job.

good,"As a seasonal worker of about 3 and 1/2 months, a typical day working at Best Buy was mundane but educational for lack of a better word. The work was never too difficult in terms of what was asked of my position on a daily basis. My co-workers were all very friendly people who I could easily relate to in both my love of technology as well as similarities in our lifestyles outside of work. The break room was comfortable and provided a nice place to relax for a few minutes during break time. Management was a bit odd at times, with managers acting more like your buddy than your boss, which always tends to leave a bad taste in my mouth as I would prefer to have at least one completely professional individual with which I could direct my questions and concerns. The hardest part of the job would probably be the fact that nobody seems to truly take the time that new employee's know how everything works. Including the terminology as well as the tasks, which creates problems later when a new employee is expected to do something of which the manager assumes was taught to him/her by either the e-learning program or word of mouth. The most enjoyable part of the job personally for me was just getting to work around all the shiny new products that I myself enjoy very much in my personal time. I found myself actually enjoying stocking when I got to do it in sections such as the video game area. Overall, I enjoyed my time working for Best Buy and would have liked to stay if they had decided to hire any of the seasonal employee's, which, unfortunately, they did not."

Management there was okay but i feel as if they did not know much about the actual products and how they are used. My coworkers have been amazing and helpful at times.

good,"Best Buy is a great place to begin working, as they pay well for starting workers. They also teach you about customer service, and give you the tools to do well at your job. Management has a habit of favouriting workers who do well on the sales floor, and treat those who do less differently no matter how hard they work. Management also has a habit of promoting workers who have less experience in the new position, rather than someone who has the experience to start the new position immediatly. People who come in to purchase things will have a habit of assuming you work off commissionand try to ignore you, or assume that you are trying to upsell them. Then they will proceed to buy the lowest price thing in your section regardless of your recommendation and then promptly return it when they realize that it will not do what they want. Its just the way retail works. Best Buy as a company does value their employees, and does treat them decently for a corporation that gets a lot of employees who just leave after a few months."

My management can also be fun but they also have a job to run and keep tabs on numbers and things of that nature. The hardest part of my job personally is hitting the numbers at a monthly goal. If I don't sell enough services my numbers drop. I am very good with clients although I do not sell enough services. When referring to services Im speaking of remote programmings, mounting services in other locations in the home, networking, etc. I have a hard time selling if I do not see an opportunity for it.

The pay is also the best you'll get in Best Buy short of a salaried position (especially if you are a repair tech.)"
good,"I was responsible for providing expertise in mobile devices and assist customers in purchasing a total solution to their mobile needs. I would also help manage inventory, stock items, work on trainings to expand my knowledge base and assist around the store as needed. I truly enjoyed my team and immediate supervisor because of the family attitude and continuity we had built."
good,"Overall working at best buy gave me some good experience with customers which helped me get some experience. I learned how to handle the cash and help customers. My co-workers were nice and helped me out when i needed help. There was nothing extremely difficult about working at Best Buy, but the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work in a team environment."
good,Good place to work if you enjoy electronics and can do customer service.  The management was amazing and the customers were always challenging with their inquiries.
good,Everyday is something different. You will encounter a new computer problem everyday and that makes the job so interesting. The geek squad culture is amazing.
good,"meetings, work, fun"
good,This job was a good stepping stone for people looking for their first . job. I've learned about many technological advances/
good,I enjoy working for this company. They do provide great customer service and training! You are able to advance quickly if there are openings available.
good,"I loved working at Geek Squad, I always had something to do, goals to meet and great people on my team to work with. I would recommend this job to anyone who is interested in customer service or technology related jobs."
good,"If opening store turn on all display products in your department. Make and check list of those for down stock through the day."
good,"Fast paced work environment will be a challenge, especially if this is the first job you've work at in computers. You must be able to multitask extremely efficiently."
good,On a daily we protect our Store Merchandise from criminals. We learn to place closely to details because we learn as asset protection detail is everything . Management will look at you as one of them because you are the eyes and heart of the store . Hardest part of the job is standing there alone (because that's what the shift consist of) and watching the whole store from customers to employees by you're self.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Overall it is a good place to work. Technology is fun and you are around plenty of it. It is a good temporary or part-time second job. There is no room for advancement. During my time they had budget cuts and my store got rid of an assistant store manager and 4 leads. The other thing that sucks is that there is a cap for pay at 11.50 so there were people who left because they were capped on their salary.
good,"Many years after leaving the company, I can STILL remember the values  of the company. We worked hard but the company treated the employees well. I was at the corporate office and I worked in the store during school and I enjoyed both experiences."
good,good place to work after 30 days get sweet benefits. pay is ok. people are actually pretty nice and do their job most part. it will take you forever to advance if your lucky enough to.
good,Great place to work if your in school and need something to get you by but not really recommended for those looking to sustain a household unless you get into management.
good,"fun experience "
good,It was a good sales experience. I talked to many people and helped them with what they needed.  It was a good job and people were all nice.
good,"my most favorite part was working with customers and learning new things everyday. It was always something new, never a dull moment"
good,"greet and assist customers in finding the product that best fits there needs and addressing and issues or concerns that customers may have. cashier duties, down stocking, ordering things and much more."
good,I enjoyed working at Best Buy but had to find a full-time position and was unable to continue to work there. Great atmosphere to work in.
good,The most amazing people to work with. It makes work very enjoyable. I would recommend working at this particular location to anyone.
good,"great work space! would love to work there again! Theres not job id rather have. Mangers were a little rude at the time, but overall a great job to have."
good,"Good people and perks, the systems could be better. I believe the company is going in the right direction. The management has a great understanding of what it takes to lead in this environment. The progress to middle management will take a few years."
good,Best Buy is a great company and I have good time working there. I learn the ins and out of how the retail industry works. I move up in this company and I was grateful for the opportunity.
good,"A typical day at work is opening or closing duties. We greet each and every customer. Training is on computer modules an typically last 2-4 days. Management is okay, sometimes they can play favorites, but you'll get your share."
good,"While I enjoy my work and find satisfaction in the service I provide, I'm not entirely confident that Best Buy has been growing as a company as of late. The pay and benefits involved aren't terrible, but not satisfactory to meet my life goals and needs, and I could easily be making exponentially more money at a different company."
good,"Great job. Management was easy to get along with, great team. Enjoyed being on the sales floor helping customers. A typical day consisted of talking to several people and products. Co-workers were great team, most enjoyable part was selling the best products."
good,"Competitive and well managed location, that has good leadership. hard workers are regularly recognized and given opportunities to advance into different positions and even into leadership positions."
good,"A typical day now starts with employees reviewing their month to date performance, as well as the store's. This gives each individual the chance to evaluate themselves and identify their own areas for improvement. Managers/Supervisors are able to help employees who want to improve more efficiently this way.New systems are in place to automatically apply for open positions based off of your personal interest. The hardest part of the job would be the inconsistent schedule for each week. That can take away from family life. Selling the right items to people and hearing their appreciation for assistance gives the most job satisfaction."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I worked at In-Store pick up. During the opening shift I would print out a report that shows what items were waiting to be picked up and had to make sure they were all there so that when the customer arrives it's already waiting to be picked up. I would answer the phones and provide customer service over the phone as well as handle customer issues and any orders via the Order Management System.
good,"Anyone who knows me knows that I absolutely love technology. Something about seeing the future develop right before my eyes makes me euphoric in a sense. A typical day at work would have me printing out the morning orders (if I worked in the morning), ensuring all the orders were in and located whether they be at my station or in the warehouse, and turning on the phones when the doors opened. Once the day started, my duties would be assisting customers over the phone with any problems or questions they had, backing up customer assistance, placing orders in person, over the phone, and online, releasing orders to those coming to pick them up, and, at times, helping customers out with any questions they had. I learned a lot while at Best Buy and I don't regret my experiences even though customer service was very challenging and led to me choose not to be kept when the season was over. Management was very fair and to do this respect what they do. Best Buy is a large business and it is hard to maintain order within an ever changing environment. My co-workers were phenomenal and I couldn't have asked for better people to work around. I felt almost at home with most of them and some I even kept as friends now. The hardest part of the job was maintaining patience with easily angered customers. I could not handle it but somehow others were capable. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely being surrounded by so much technology and wonder."
good,"I worked hard, brought all I had nightly. Things really worked out there. I worked as part of a team. You really see how people care."
good,"As a Geek squad Operation Agent you have fun while being the best. One of the best things i can say about working at Best buy is have a great group of co-workers. There are one of the best co-workers if ever had, they are smart, humble, dedicated and professional group. My day to day work is great, every day is different and thats a plus for me. I love being able to help customers by phone and giving a great customer service. I've learned how to ship and receive units from third-party vendors. I've also learned how to set-up new PC. One of the most important factors that I have learned is building customer relationship."
good,a great place to help people and enjoy the tech toys as well. very easy to work at this place. best buy is a great time place to start to get your feet wet in the tech world
good,Good company. The management is okay. The only thing that wold make it better would be promotion opportunities for the AP position.
good,Typical day is team based work focused on customer service everyone makes an effort to be polite and keep things running smoothly.
good,You get to anticipate large projects and handle large volume of data. Jean's day everyday in CHQ. There is a gym in CHQ. The culture is results driven.
good,"I enjoyed working there, it allowed me to get to know all of my customers on a personal level. Taught me how to multi task while still staying calm."
good,"load & unload freight and drop shipments"
good,Best Buy is definitely a great place to work for a college student. It offers cool benefits and great discounts on tech. Typical work day is pretty easy. Hardest part is just being on your feet all day.
good,"A typical day at work would be activating phones,opening new accounts for mobile service providers. You tried to give the customer the best deal for the amount of money they were willingly to spend and still try to save them money through the process"
good,"Fun work environment. Busy time goes by fast, management is friendly. Coworkers are fun to work with and store stays busy"
good,"i learned alot about retail from my time with the company, on everything from planning sales to customer interaction. Enjoyed providing customers with world class service daily"
good,"I enjoy working at Best Buy, meeting new people everyday is my favorite part. I never have worked full time but the part job experience was great for me."
good,"Great learning experience, learned a lot of working with people. Lots of training provided to employees to learn about products/services."
good,"Out of all the jobs that I have worked, Best Buy has been the best as far as the people it hires. I enjoyed ALL of my co-workers, was able to learn quickly and effectively, felt encouraged by my managers, and was able to provide the customers with the best experience possible. To make the company even better, I think it would be helpful if management sat down and talked to each worker individually and told them the strengths they noticed and discussed ways to improve personally. I learned a great deal from this job. I enjoyed traveling to go to training in different areas for mobile sales. I learned a great deal about phones, data plans, and services."
good,great company and nice coworkers. easy going job and fun people around you all the time. Great learning experience from all departments.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Worked Full time while I was in College (full-time) and they allowed me to be able to developed the leadership basics that was needed for career advancement! Great experience!
good,"I have gained hands on experience working with computers, tablets, phones, and many more electronic devices."
good,"Plenty of physical work to drain your batteries, but great management, great team, great cafeteria."
good,"Being a Customer Transaction Specialist at Best Buy was most rewarding.  The customer genuinely can brighten up one's day.  A typical day of work would consist of an average of a 7 hour shift of standing, in which one would find themselves greeting customers, assessing customers' needs, performing fast and accurate transactions, and making sure that we have met the optimum need and want for the customer.  In working at Best Buy I have learned several skills such as various logistics in inventory, customer assessment, customer service, problem solving and customer education.  Management and my co-workers were always a pleasure to work  with daily.  The environment was very flexible and family-oriented.  The employees at Best Buy make the brand.  They are intelligent and down-to-earth people that are not working on commission.  Their aim is to provide an awesome customer experience.  All of these attributes of Best Buy would compose the most enjoyable parts of the job.  In addition, to those things, I believe that establishing a relationship of integrity with the consumer is the most rewarding.  Customers will come back and look for that special sale associate , that went above and beyond, to help them again."
good,I like pretty much everything but some of the management the best part about the job would be the people. the people you get to work with everyday
good,Constantly learning about technology and new products.  Company is fun to work for.  Management at my location is great.
good,"New acct verification, detecting fraudulent new applications, had final say in new acct approval/disapproval, also assisted with The Home Depot Adverse Action calls from consumers who were declined credit."
good,I have been blessed throughout my Best Buy career to have supportive mentors to guide me with my leadership. The most enjoyable part of being with the company was always coming to work with the team. Retail the best industry to learn from but it can wear you out if you don't know how to manage your time.
good,great first job venturing into retail. great benefits and team oriented. amazing benefits including tuition reimbursemment.
good,"A divers company that allows you to pursue your goals within the company and personally, as tuition reimbursement is offered."
good,i came in for the day got setup for the day and took care of the customers with any problems or questions they had.If a customer had a question on any items in the store and i couldnt anwer it i would sen them to the right person.We never let a customer get away with out a answer.
good,"Best buy is the perfect place if you have vast knowledge about technology. Being promoted in the company takes quite sometime, but if you're willing to wait you can rise up the ranks."
good,great customer service employees are friendly customers are great work environment is inviting and management is wonderful
good,"typical day at work would involve helping clients solve issues, selling services and technology to fit there day to day needs. answering phone calls to help clients over the phone or sell service. I have learned how to sell, fix, and maintain any kind of technology from androids, IOS, OSX, windows (Including windows 8). management was strong in cretin areas. For the most part it was self management do to poor leadership over Geek Squad. co-workers were great, we set goals for ourselves to meet for the day,week,month. fun to work with, helping each other advance in day to day situations and coming together as a team. hardest part of the job was lack of help during busy times. I enjoyed most things about this job from the people i worked with to challenging situations with clients and leadership to solve issues. loved the learning curve and something always new and challenging to troubleshoot."
good,"Répondre aux questions des clients et leur procurer ce qui correspondait le plus à leurs besoins et désirs constituaient principalement mes tâches dans une journée. L'entretient des lieux en termes de propreté, de disposition des produits et du remplissage complétait le tout. Il y avait toujours quelque chose à faire."
good,"A day at work varies from working on computers to helping promote a sale.  You try your hardest to find the best solution to a problem, or present many solutions that will have the same desired effect.  Management is always available to lend a hand if needed and is always there for coaching."
good,"Best Buy taught me how to sell. They taught me how to give a proper solution to a customer. Management was encouraging and eager to help. My coworkers were nice people and really felt like a family that was ready to help at any given moment. The hardest part of the job was leaving, my location closed down. The most enjoyable part of the job was watching myself get better everyday. The training here was some of the best I have ever received."

good,"I was never an actual employee of that best buy. It was just me and two other students learning what it was like to have a job and to get an idea of what working at a job was like. We only worked there twice a week and only worked for about two hours. When i was there i can say that it did seem like a good place to work at. It was well managed, had good employee's that actually who were nice enough to help us a bit when we needed it. I'd definitely work there if i had the chance."
good,"co-workers are fun to be area with, sometimes customers aren't very nice, management are easy to talk to and they understand how customers can get."
good,I would like to grown individual in a great company who care about their employees. I like working in a place where I could make a difference in a individual life.
good,"Consistent learning about newest technology. Great for tech savvy people. Younger employees are prevalent, which makes makes work a little less professional, but can be fun at times. Unable to show significant difference between yourself and other employees if you do not work in sales. Little to no recognition for exemplary work on a daily basis. Little room for advancement, but their firing policy is very lenient."
good,"The store that I worked at was a great store. Friendly people, great customers. They like to train the employees in the area that they need it in. My manager always listened to my idea or complaint if I had any. Over all, it was a good experience."

good,"Not sure about FT employees, but PT here is pretty great! Decent pay, advancement opportunities, and benefits that you usually don't receive elsewhere for similar positions (bonuses, etc.). Hours per week vary based on budget from corporate."
good,Best Buy is a good place to start off but it does not pay a whole lot and the full time jobs are hard to come by. The days are short and easy to deal with. If you have questions management is ready to help at any time.
good,"Great place to work for a career. Started as a level 1 entry position and moved up to management within a year. Really enjoyed the work, and helping others. It's a great work environment, and would recommend to anyone interested working there."
good,Over my few months are Best Buy I learned the skills of communicating and teamwork.  I learned how to work on my own and with other people will in the merchandise and warehouse part of the store.  I developed strong communication skills will going on deliveries for the appliances.
good,My days were long and hard took a lot out of me. My managers were great to work for and I learned a lot about  the company. One of the best things about the job is I had no one looking over my shoulder every five minutes.

good,"At Best Buy i learned how to be more sociable and better at giving perfect customer service, i also like the support of my management and co-works. The hardest part of my job is when we  get crowed and i have no coverage but overall i enjoyed my time at Best Buy"
good,"I worked at Best Buy as a lead installer both for Magnolia Home Theater and also as it converted to Geek Squad. Products are great, installations were well documented, and efficient. As the transition into Geek Squad began it became a little hectic, and the quality of installation procedures fell slightly. Advancement seemed to be based solely on time with the company as opposed to work ethic."
good,"A typical day includes dealing with customers, and working with friendly associates and outstanding management."
good,"I worked at Best Buy for under a year. Great environment, great coworkers, great management. The problem is the pay. Also, I was told that it was easy to advance, and after working very hard there and giving them good solid numbers, I went for two promotions only to be turned down because someone had been there longer. Advancement should be awarded to those who work the hardest, not those who have worked there the longest. Other than that, great company to work for if retail is your thing."
good,Typical day interacting with customers and helping find the correct entertainment they are looking for. Great environment and great people to work with.
good,"I really enjoyed working at best buy/pacific sales. my co-workers really showed me a lot they had patients when it came to showing me a new task. I learned how to do a will call, truck check ins, more of data entry, how to create a manifest, and also to do cross referencing."
good,"Overall, Management is good  at this particular store. The environment is professional but still fun. If you enjoy helping people this is the place to be."
good,"For the time that I was there, I really enjoyed it. It was a fast-paced job that kept me busy- which is something I like. I would have loved to have been there longer, or perhaps move to another department, but I was let go after the holiday season. My favorite part of the job was helping the customer with any questions they had, and informing them on the products they were buying. I also liked to up-sell and sell customer warranties and credit cards."
good,"I truly enjoyed my time with Best Buy. My unit was in a smaller market, and the upward mobility was understandably a little slow."
good,"I've been with the company for 9 years and enjoy working with the company. The benefits are good. For me personably, I need more time with the family and a balanced work schedule. Working with the management and co-workers are the best part of the job."
good,fun fast pass working environment fun loving managers and everyone looks out for each other Anytime you need something or need help with anything someone is always around and is willing to help you out.

good,Great sales at best buy mobile the people was nice and we all work hard as a team.
good,I had a lot of fun working in the BBY mobile department. It challenged me and my team to compete with one another while helping each other obtain out daily and monthly goals. We sold different phones and plans  to a variety of people and provided our customers with knowledge of these different plans.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Employees all help one another without hesitation, I believe it's due to the personality test you haft to take before being hired. Also, the management team at my store are all concerned about the well being of the employees. I've learned about product system's, ordering, Point of Sale, Geek Squad services and system (FMS) and customer service in dealing with the public.Hardest part of the job would be the customers that give you a hard time for no apparent reason, makes the job a little bit harder but nothing I can't handle anymore due to my 9+ years of service."
good,"Entire company has very positive environment and promotes being who you want to be. Can be promoted very quickly if you have the work ethic and desire to improve. Some management in the district area (not local area, corporate) will do whatever is necessary to protect themselves, but that is expected, be careful who you befriend at times."
good,Identified prospective customers using lead generating methods (CRM). Delivered excellent customer service by greeting and assisting each customer.
good,Be able to provide excellent client services. Being able to give end to end solutions as well as consulation advice.

good,"Focus was on driving solutions.  Most enjoyable part of work was employee engagement. Best Buy was instrumental in my growth on the business side, but I was unsure of where the company was heading for in the future."
good,Working at Best Buy was a lot of fun. Everyday interacting with new people was exciting because you get to learn about what people are into and what products they enjoy having. Working with team members who want to motivate and succeed was always amazing because they pushed you to be your best.
good,"My morning starts out at the store where I clock in, login and review my schedule for the day. Each order is different and each one requires different treatment. While my assistant makes confirmation phone calls to the customers on our schedule, I gather equipment, deliveries, supplies for the day. If necessary, I call remaining customers and verify the details of their order. I load up our company van with the things I gathered earlier and we drive to our customers homes as they are scheduled, making stops in between jobs for lunch and breaks. A typical day would consist of 5 jobs spread throughout kern county with large tv  installations, surround sound installations, computer set ups and diagnostics,  and consultations with customers looking to install a home theater or office. I also make repairs to tvs and appliances, Then, it's back to the store where I complete paperwork, reevaluate inventory, supervise in the store when needed. But I prefer being out in the field. Sometimes we get yelled at because the store sold a job wrong (its not their fault, they aren't in the field) and we have to tell the customer that they have to pay more or their equipment isn't compatible. In the beginning their anger really bothered me, I got flustered and nervous and couldn't put thoughts together which angered them more. I've mostly learned how to handle that. People. In the retail industry, people come first and I've certainly learned how to make them feel that way. Slow down, speak with respect, mean what you say and get the job done. The hardest part is definitely that. The frustrated"

good,"Unlike any other job their is out there, Best Buy had the best break room. Whenever an employee wanted to take a break, they could just head to that specific room in the store. It had a flat screen tv, couches, vending machines, tables, and etc. A typical day at work was actually fun and interesting. While selling different merchandise, I was able to learn new things about each product. I've met all kinds of people including R&B singer Angie Stone, which is a resident of the Columbia area. That experience itself, was uplifting and magical."
good,"Working form home has its pros and cons, but being able to work and repair 20 to 30 computers a day is a lovely challenge."
good,This job is very easy but it can also be demanding since its a retail environment. Typically if you can best assist the customer to their needs then thats your job. You become very close to your co workers and the leadership team is very easy and friendly. They make you feel like you are a part of something bigger.
good,Good for someone who is looking to get a degree in criminal justice
good,If you enjoy computers this is a good job to have. It is more of a beginner level/intermediate level computer position
good,"Working at Best Buy has certainly expanded my experiences in the working world while having fun. Not having worked retail before this job, it was a drastic change to adapt to.

I worked along side some great people and under good supervisors who were all more than willing to help, train, and answer any questions that I had.  Overall, good experience."
good,"Other than days when the truck comes in, it is laid back and time ti train and understand the job.On truck days it is fast paced and long days but it goes fast.  Management is flexible and will work with you."
good,"I learned a lot about team work, organization, and how to balance hard work with a fun environment."
good,"A typical day at work varied by which department I was working in.

good,"The job itself is straight forward. It can be a fun and enjoyable experience, but the turnaround rate is pretty high for both employees and management. I could say that I enjoyed myself with my coworkers and managers, but that would only be at three month intervals.

good,"Management tended to neglect employee needs and requests. I guess that's sort of expected when you look at their massive crews. All-in-all, the discount is what makes the job.

We all understood that this was a job and there were business goals that had to be achieved, but that didn't mean we couldn't have fun while doing it."

good,"The typical work day revolved around satisfying all customer needs, wants, and desires. I learned valuable skills in order to satisfy customers and meet daily goals. Managers were very generous and willing to assist every member of the team with various task in order to guarantee an efficient and dynamic work environment. Everyone is a member of your team and synergy was crucial for satisfying company expectations and serving customers. The hardest part of the job was making the most out of lower traffic days.

Learning about customers and assisting them with finding the right product for their needs was the greatest part of the job."

There, I unloaded shipment and worked in product processing where I changed out advertisement prices and displays in the store. After seeing my hard work ethic for three years, I was promoted to asset protection. Here, I greet customers, give them a tour of the store, check receipts, watch cameras, and protect against theft.

good,Geek Squad does a great job in making sure you are fully trained and know everything about your position.
good,"This is a review from years ago but my experience there was pleasant."
good,"Best Buy is a great and fun company to work for. I believe that the Vacaville, CA store could be better managed, but that is the only issue with working at this store.

The skills I've learned definitely will stick with me always and continue to make my job an enjoying experience each and every day"
good,"Great place to work, however not to much room for advancement in the company unless you get managers that hire on merit and not favorites. Same down sides as any retail job. Would recommend friends to work there. management is really supportive for team members and helpful."

good,"fun job"
good,"Good company to work for. Great vibe from co workers, quick and effective training. Most of the managers are understanding and are willing to get their hands dirty right along with you. The GM is a great talker and good at getting the workers pumped up for the morning shift, very real and excited to be there, however didn't know to much that was going on in the store. Couldn't answer simple store questions as far as layout of the store or product locations. Communications between managers were good but not great."
good,Fun place to work there was always an opportunity to gain more hours.
good,"cool job! i enjoyed my time there. i wish it was a part time job, but unfortunately it a seasonal job."
good,"It's a little better than the average retail place, mostly due to the benefits, but that's about the only difference. At the end of the day, you're a salesperson and that's as much as you're going to be unless you stay long enough to be considered for management, then the cycle just repeats."
good,Love going into a job where your clients appreciate the work you do for them. You'll always have some clients who aren't happy with certain answers you give them but just got to be understanding. Co-workers who love to have fun but still get work done. I loved getting to work on and fix peoples computers and see excitement when your client learns something as well. Learned a lot about Computer Repairs in the time I was at Geek Squad.
good,"The job at Geek Squad was both motivated and fulfilling. They have their own set of standards and hold them tightly. The day to day of work starts and ends with interfacing customers with their own machines and teaching them how to properly utilize them, often showing them features and functions they did not know existed. Co-workers are supportive, and often carry on jovially. However, at the end, it is about security of customer information and taking care of them first - as this business is entirely people-oriented. There are no self-made productions and you way to shine is through hard work and a good attitude."
good,"I am part of a team of 9 and we travel all over the country to different Best Buy locations and perform remodels and small transformations.  We work overnight to complete work while store is closed.  "

The hardest part of the job was learning the new systems but it didnt take long for me to get the hang out it."
good,Thought me a lot about technology keeps you current coworkers feel more like family great place
good,"I've learned so much while working at best buy. there are so many aspects to the job and to the company. There is never nothing to do. if you like busy work, you'll love working there."
good,"i unloaded trucks seperate products by skus"
good,Great place to learn the basics of customer service and sales. Hours are tough but worth it. The amount of mangers and supervisors are overwhelming and sometimes detrimental to overall sales synergy.
good,Great Place to work if you're looking for something very laid back but the only thing is it is a non commission based job but treated like a commission based job. I have a full grown beard with many visible tattoos and had an eyebrow piercing and they didn't mind. pay is not that great and if you're part time you don't see many hours. If you don't have open availability it is hard to move up. but they are very flexible with the availability though.
good,"My time at best buy was pretty good. not too stressful, or hard. We didn't work on a commission basis so we were able to focus on the customers themselves instead of the ""bottom line"""
good,I really enjoyed my position in the warehouse.  I had great co-workers and we all worked very well together.  The only thing I did not like about this job is how some weeks I would get 40 hours and then other weeks I would work 10.

good,Interact and spread knowledge to customers about Car audio products..Assist in the installations of car radio and speakers.

good,"I liked working in the warehouse as opposed to the retail store because it was hard, honest work. Organizing inventory and getting it out the door, ready for sale, was the simplest most demanding part of the job that kept you on your toes."
good,"I work from 7am-4pm m-w. I check my work email to see if there is any changes to the workload. I print out all the weekly paperwork, organize filing cabinet. Talk to Store manager about all the work I am going to proform in there store. I usually work alone and if I have any questions about the work I am doing I consult the visual merchandising standards or call my supervisor. I send out emails to the store managers and my manager after every day telling them how things went and what I did that day."
good,They take time to teach you how to manage their systems and to work with customers along with employees.
good,"I have Best Buy to thank for most of my working experience. I not only learned how to handle cash and create custom orders for customers, I learned how to manage teams and work well with people."

good,I worked in the Home Theater Department.  Was always fun having representatives from the different brands come out and do product demonstrations.
good,Oversea correct stock and promotions. Responsible for meeting and exceeding goals and quota
good,Best Buy is an honest company but bad apples are everywhere and people can mess a great day up but in retail that is to be expected from time to time and nothing is perfect.
good,Worked here during the Christmas season and several months after it was a very busy environment. I dealt with many different types of customers but overall the experience was one that i really enjoyed.
good,"Enjoyed working for them, great company making a great comeback. Work/life balance is very hard as it is an any retail enviroment."
good,People were helpful.friend and always ready to help out when situations were busy during holiday seasons
good,"Flexible start time."
good,"Love this job, the benefits of working here are great if you enjoy a decent employee discount and are always looking to expand your knowledge like I do.  Daily tasks include merchandising, assisting customers in selecting products while having good conversations and learning about them.  Job isn't difficult, just remember to fill out required recommendation sheets for every customer. Most enjoyable part of the job for me was the various learnings I could do through Microsoft, Best Buy and other vendors that give you access to free stuff and prizes.  In about 2 hours worth of e-learnings I earned 2 years of Xbox live gold, $120 off a 2 TB external/cloud hard drive. You'll meet a lot of great people, but the flip side is you'll also meet a lot of nasty/rude people as well."
good,"They work was boring, but the coworkers and managers were awesome. Fun place to work and would go back if the pay was higher."
good,All around good place to work .I would like explore other options.
good,"check out customers, assists with needs, activate phones,"
good,"I would go to work, did what i needed to do and then left when my shift was over. Helped customers by being helpful and polite. Management was friendly and helpful"
good,A typical day was spending the majority of the shift out on the floor interacting with customers and pushing sales. I learned a massive amount of knowledge from Best Buy because they have a very good learning program that actually rewarded those who went above and beyond with how much knowledge they wanted to gain. Management was friendly but you knew they were your boss. They helped a lot with learning how to sell and critiqued your customer interactions frequently. Co-workers were very easy to get along with and I still have friends from the company even after not working there for more than a year.
good,"Best Buy is great for learning about all types of different technology. Job security is the best, since performance is based mostly on customer service than sales. A non-commission based work style makes for a friendly non-competitive atmosphere. The employees are great, the management is great and overall the companies core values are respectable. As selling is still important its comes easy because people are constantly in need of the newest technology. It can be a very busy and sometimes overwhelming work atmosphere, mostly on days such as black friday and special release days. If you handle busy days well like I do, you will have no problem."

good,"Pros:"
good,"It was a great first job (in high school) and I don't mind working there again now while I get through college.  Best Buy is a good place to learn about how the retail, and to some extent, the corporate worlds work.  It offers a lot of training and everyone is always encouraged to perform their best."
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers better understand a variety of store products. With inventory work a typical day would be price scanning and moving in-store products around throughtout the store. I learned a lot of information about in-store products such as GPS, Radio systems, TVs, IPODs. The management was professional. My co-workers were helpful and hard workers. The hardest part of the job was learning price scanning. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting and working with customers."

good,Learned all about technology and customer service in a fast paced sales environment.
good,I enjoy working with products i love myself and learning from vendors and training to become a better salesmen.
good,I learned what is like to try and be a sales person. Management would be there for you if you needed anything. The co-workers were always great people to work with. The hardest part was selling stuff to people that it did not seem to fit them but you had to try because of management.
good,"Wonderful. Never really had a problem. With hard work, you'll be elevated to a hair position."
good,Best Buy is a good place to work. the only downside is that most of the time you can't get a set schedule.
good,"its a good place to work, with many changes. Politics can occur at certain locations but as long as you keep to yourself you'll be fine. The co workers can be great but also back stabbing. Enjoyed working with technology."

good,Great place to work.  Constantly meeting new people.  Growth opportunity and advancement.
good,"Wasn't there for long but co-Workers were great, shared jokes but got the job done efficiently. Great environment and great people overall, depends on location though."
good,"Best Buy as a company really takes care of their employees. The employee discount is excellent. The health insurance is excellent. The down side is that this is a college town.

good,I would direct customers to the right department depending on their needs. I would check the customer out. Cash handling was a great experience.
good,"This is a great place to work for however, I found myself making small changes for the benefit of the company constantly. As with any company I thought this to be normal and was okay with all of them until a big change came that brought disappointment to all of my peers and made some of them including myself look for another place to work for. This change will affect our pay in way that we must now pay for something we never did before. We would have drastic schedules which would affect our lives at home.

If you were scheduled before store opening, you were required to start your day at 6am to restock and help with store opening, coming in the middle of the day would require starting on the sales floor as quickly as possible.

My co-workers and I work really well together and we all bring something to the table as far as us being a team. There are co-workers that work better with computers, and then there's co-workers that work better with the customer service systems and services. Some times it is hard to explain the rules and services that Best Buy offers. The most enjoyable part of best buy is that it is always interactive.

good,"The start to a typical day at Best Buy would start with an employee meeting right before the doors opened.

good,Understanding through communication of management translation of goals for each days production expectations before trustfully performing tasks required independently .
good,"Even thought I was placed under a seasonal position, I still had tons of fun working in BestBuy.

I worked in the gaming department and I assisted many customers during my time there."
good,"Greeting the guest, handling cash, making quotes, stocking product."
good,"Best Buy is a good company. While the investor community may not have faith in the company it is a good place to work. The company does take care of their employees and tries to provide a positive work/life balance. The ability to grow with the company is there but there is the need to build your brand if you want to move up. There is not a typical day, however you will work directly with customers no matter what your role is in the company. You need to be flexible and not expect the same routine everyday. You need ot be ready to deal with a change in direction at any time, which may not be for everyone. The people that work for company are fun good natured people that want to do well."

It also requires product knowledge of the products and accessories, services like service plans (extended warranties) on products, deliveries and the latest promotions. My Job as a Supervisor consisted of being a mentor and leading my team to success by leading by example. At Best Buy I ran my own department by my self, customer service, coached my team by directing sales, prepared schedules and unloaded trucks. The hardest part of the job was maintaining 1# over and over in sales because I was MVP. The most enjoyable part of the job is having fun with the customers and making them happy."

A day of work was never something I would regret waking up to. Good laugh's great customer service. Co-workers I still talk to and see outside the work field which is great. The hardest part of the job would have to be when there is little to no work I like to keep moving and doing things, no challenge would stop me. Most enjoyable part is being able to work so well with others, it was just a great place to be the people around made it that much more worth it."

good,"Best Buy was a great place to work. The management was mostly professional and the co-workers were decently well placed and helpful. The only thing I would say that was negative was the benefits. Unless you were full time or management you didn't get benefits. It is difficult for an individual to work somewhere with no medical, vision or dental insurance (especially with the changes to healthcare that are going on right now and next year). This may have changed, but when I was there, this is how it was."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be more or less meeting the needs of customers end to end, in a nut shell that means finding the right solution for the customer using selling skills from the sales induction class. I worked in almost every are in the store so I'm knowledgable in setting up wireless plans, also stocking shelves, handling cash, cleaning and make the store customer ready"
good,Loved the experience. Working with new technoloigy was a plus. Con would be moving up in the organization.
good,"Working for Best Buy provides an excellent place to learn about sales and sales culture. The trainings are easy to find and use, and the expectations are always clear at the beginning of the day. What lacks is accountability. In an attempt to make a fun and non-threatening workplace they have some what nuetered the Supervisory structure so that side work and tasking is almost always one diligent and hardworking employee, while the primary sellers ignore those duties."
good,"Geek Squad City, the largest computer repair facility in the world, is an almost unimaginable place. Knowing that in a 240,000 sq ft building, we receive 5000+ customer units a day and countless of other parts and pieces for whatever new project we are piloting is amazing. The people are all friendly, the leadership is all about empowering their own people and every one truly cares for the well being of their fellow co-workers. During the downtime there are several xboxes, ps3's, ping pong tables and even a pool table."
good,"i enjoyed the people i worked with, hated working on the holidays"
good,"Best Buy is a leading electronics retailer that puts employees and customers first. The culture of honesty and hard work is refreshing. A typical day consists of assisting customers by taking in customer information, processing sales, repairing laptop and desktops and setting up new PCs."
good,"Co-workers are great, management is helpful, but the hours are hard for anyone with a family; especially around the holidays."
good,"Relatively fun environment. Training was a bit lax but you learn things through customer interactions, and sometimes that means you learn a bit late."
good,Very energetic place and makes workers feel like family. Learned different sales and management techiniques that equiped me to maximize my potential on a day to day basis. Co-workers are very helpful and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was to determine the day to day sales quota for the departments.
good,I worked 5 out of 7 days a week answering customer phone calls. I learned how to operate a multi-channeled phone system as well as the POS and Order management system.
good,"Very natural, You just have similar routine everyday which involves communication with other, sometimes you are pressured from management team for sales!"
good,"Merchandising, customer service, register assistance. Stocking"
good,For the past 2.75 years I've had the privilege of working with some of the best people in this area. The employees in my department go above and beyond for each other and really make this high stress job easier.
good,It's a great place to work. I've learned a lot and get to work with some really talented individuals. All of the recent transitions have changed the company but hopefully for the better.

good,"By having access to all the latest gadgets and technology buff would love this job. Hours are flexible and it works great for college students. Opportunities for advancement are abound and anyone can advance into a more serious role. However management lacks leadership at times and training is less than satisfactory. Favoritism was also a problem at the store. The hardest part of this job is dealing with all of the customer needs pertaining to cell phones, it takes a long time to become comfortable at the position, but is rewarding once reached."
good,"A typical day at work is fast pace, sale sale and sale."
good,Assist customers with finding electronic solutions to his or her unique needs. Learn sales process and product knowledge. Ensure displays are functional. Re-stock product display areas.
good,"Morning meetings we were told what was expected from us throughout the day then we were to go do our own things, managers were helpful with irate customers but not always willing to back you up if you got into a disagreement. Positive employee environment and great staff. Hardest part of job was handling irate customers that always had a problem with something on the shelf or the company as a whole."
good,Great place to work with plenty of potential to do other things outside of the work place which will help you become a better person. A positive environment which promotes personal growth.

You really need to be a people person and one who is goal driven."
good,"As Operations Manager, I was responsible for hiring, training, and coaching all Associates; overseeing cashier productivity, and performance as it relates to encouraging service plans and credit. All Leaders take turns in Sales Leading for customer interaction and direction to Department Specialists to ask lifestyle questions for most satisfying product match."
good,Positive fun and friendly all of my co workers were great and my work enviorment was fun and always productive and interesting.
good,"A typical day on the job entailed opening the Home Theater section of the store. Powering on all television sets, as well as ensuring full functionality of the devices. Customers were to contacted upon entering your sales area, and although Best Buy sales persons are no longer commissioned attaining sales goals are an expectation. Co-workers tend to be friendly and engaging, and management is there to guide and teach, versus scolding and monitoring. The most enjoyable part of the job is the holiday season in which there are many store events and lunches, but it is also the hardest part of the job. During the holidays hours are long and strenuous, and customers are plentiful."
good,Having fun while being the best. Worked with the best team I could ask for.
good,"Best Buy is an awesome place to work with great benefits if you are full time. Being part time at Best Buy has its flaws. No benefits, small bonuses, and unpaid time off. There's also not much room for advancement if you are furthering your education"
good,This company is fun to work for. The only problem is it changes all the time.
good,Great place to work. Awesome managers and friendly sale associates. I learned a lot of selling skills and I became more comfortable with employees.
good,"There are no ""typical days"" in retail; each day brings a new challenge or a new problem for you to solve. I've learned a lot from Best Buy, but not all of it is applicable to non-retail jobs. Management will vary from store to store, but my management is awesome and I wouldn't trade them for anything."
good,I really enjoyed this company. Management and staff was great. Flexiable schedual.
good,"Typical day is transporting goods from one place to another. My daily tasks consists of tracking in Ipods that are shipped in daily and sending them over to the proper department that service the Ipods. Once Ipods are serviced, they are being exported back to the service store and given back to the customer in great condition."
good,"See below. Typical day included unloading trucks, running warehouse operations."
good,"Overall it was a decent working environment. I learned a lot about the retail industry and a lot about leadership. In my supervisor role I performed several interviews, performance management, monthly, quarterly, and yearly appraisals, developed growth plans to improve on department opportunities. I learned what to look for in people to help develop them into strong employees. Having a great relationship with your employees and management is critical in the success of any business, which I had. The hardest part of my job was handling consumer complaints. I did a very good job at it, however the difficulty for any manager is finding the way to appease the customer, employee experience, and the shareholders all in the same decision. The aspect I liked most was being around people. I loved meeting new people and training new people. The interview process I really liked as well because it was exciting to see reactions based on questions you asked, then reviewing those applicants."

good,"A typical day at work can either be very busy or very slow. On the slow days one wants to make sure they are cleaning or doing something productive, but also making the customers top priority. One a busy day one just gets to each and every customer as quickly as possible, but also making sure not to cut corners with the customer they are currently working with. One always wants to be sure to give the customers the best service possible the first time to keep them coming back again and again without any complaints, only compliments. You will learn a lot working here. The ins and outs of every products how they work, function, and also how to pick the perfect product for each different customer.

good,Everybody that i worked with a best buy had a good attitude. The managers were really good at explain how things need to be done.
good,A typical day at work would be processing returns and help customers. I learned how to deal with different attitude. Management was lovely and help in any one possible and my co-workers where lovely to work with. The hardest part of my job is when i couldnt help a customer and they start yelling or throwing things at you. The most enjoyable part of my job is when im able to put a smile on a customer face.

good,The day consist of running the cash register and selling products. It also included for me the ability to learn about all the new products that are coming out so you would be up to date on the top products. The management is really outgoing in the way that they want you to grow as an employee.
good,"The company expects a lot from their employees and provides them with the tools to learn about their products. They expect us to have the knowledge to provide the customer a complete solution to their needs and wants. There are a lot of demands, but not a lot of reward. The people are fun to work with and the management team tries to make it an enjoyable experience, but it is still a part time retail job. I am being challenged to learn more about the products I sell and trying to manage all the new paper work while still effectively helping customers, but my skills as a designer are not being used here."
good,"Currently I am a Customer Solutions Manager (Sales Manager) with Best Buy. My responsibilities include but are not limited to, teaching and motivating a staff of 60-80 employees of diverse backgrounds and experience to deliver a world class customer experience with emphasis on delivering financial results. Within this kind of setting and vastly different personalities, it is imperative that I continue to focus on my staff as individuals and learn who they are as a person. Therefore enabling me to make connections and identify unique avenues to motivate and empower my team to continuously go above and beyond measures to deliver expectations.

good,"A typical day at Bestbuy would involve showing customers various computer products and trying to find the perfect solution to fit their needs. While this was enjoyable and satisfying, the hardest (and consequently the least enjoyable part) came in selling warranty plans. This is where Bestbuy management would watch individual salesmen and judge their performance and although it is not a commission based job, survival in the computer department depended on performance of selling warranty plans and geek-squad set ups."
good,I love working at best buy and still can't believe casa grande location is closed .

good,"The Computer Department is the where BestBuy gains its revenue. In the department you would need to know everything about computers and if you dont know have to able to research the information. The Customers that comes to BestBuy relay on to get them out the computer or tablets that fits their needs. In the Department you need to show the benefits of the special services that Geek Squad offers, Computer isn't the only knowledge that you would need to know. The areas you would need to know about is the Routers, Modems, hard drives, printers, and any other products in that department. The hardest part of the the department is trying to meet the revenue for the company. I like most about the job is talking with the customers."
good,it was an alright place to be ... i loved it but the other co workers had alot to complain about which made it really hard to maintain that love ..
good,"I needed more advancement opportunities. Typical day at work was very social. I greeted the guests, as well as keep an eye for suspicious behavior, always keep track on security cameras and made sure the customer walked out laughing or smiling."
good,I loved working for Best Buy. The management and environment was fun and understanding. The only problem with Best Buy is that they do not hire full time employees to save by not providing insurance and benefits.
good,"Typical day consists of checking on performances and behaviors, but also developing and training. I have learned a great deal about the business aspect of Best Buy and continue to stand at the top among my peers. Not only are my superiors supportive but also share the same competitiveness that I do and that is striving to be the best and make a difference. My co-workers all look up to me as a leader and enjoy working for me because they see my motivation and work ethic and know what is expected of them. The most challenging aspect of my job is pushing them beyond their limits without immediate reward or incentive but the most enjoyable part of my day is the relationships that I continue to build and being apart of something that they can take away from their experience with not only Best Buy but with me as a role model."
good,it was lovely everyday. to be great at everything you do no matter the position you are holding.. i loved helping my customers all day long...
good,They are a good company to work for. I learned and advanced there.
good,Good people and job oppurtunities. I still miss this company.
good,I was a Lead Auto Tech. Basically I got the pleasure of running the install bay. I loved this job but it really depends on the management that you work under. At first I thought I had found my final career. Once management switched so did their key values and I was no longer valuable and was treated as such. I quickly found a much better paying job.
good,12 years with the company.
good,"Well a typical day at work is helping everybody find a solution, my co-workers are very knowledgeable and you are always learning something new."
good,"Working in the number one consumer electronic retailer has its perks with the generous employee discount, competitive wages, and tuition assistance. I just cant raise two kids under two with the demanding work schedule of mostly evenings shifts."
good,"I had a seasonal job here, the pay was decent and the co workers friendly. They took the time to show me how the store ran and trained me well. Everyone had each others back"
good,"Very interesting atmosphere, tech savy culture and enviroment"
good,It has been a great company to work for. I was treated relatively well over the years and would recommend them to my friends and family.
good,unique experience with ability to interact with hundreds of people a day.
good,"I loved working at Geek Squad because they have a lot of fun things for employees to do during breaks and before work, and the job was easy and great employers..."
good,I was a nice place to work. friendly coworkers and helpful management.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The store I worked for was awesome,cool environment manager cared for both the employees and customers wellbeing. cool prizes for work well done and very knowledgeable associates."
good,"best buy is a great company to work for, from the management to the staff."
good,Starting pay is really good to start with raises every year. Management is great and listens to you concerns. Everyone is friendly and my co workers are great. Never feels like I'm just going to work. They offer a Ton of PTO with options to buy more PTO when signing up for benefits. The benefits are really good here. Great hours when were busy but when it's slow its SLOW... Overall it's a great place to work.
good,"When I was hired I wasn't expecting it to be such a decent place to work. Like most places of employment there are issues, but that happens."
good,"Along with acquiring professional skills, you acquire a lot of product knowledge as well that helps you in your day to day life. Management shows a lot of care for employees with constant rewards, and acknowledgement."
good,"Great coworkers, amazing things to learn, and great place to grow and make a career. scheduling could be better and some managers are okay depending on the store."
good,"They like to play video games, and are fun. Managers are mainly all on the same page. Good opportunity for growth, keep an eye on your numbers.  Show leadership skills they do keep an eye, sometimes being loud won't hurt either."
good,"Working at Best Buy was a great experience overall. However, the management was very unfair and one-sided with employees about time-off or certain objectives throughout the day."
good,Working here taught me valuable communication and sale skills that I still use today. I enjoyed the work environment and being able to help customers in a fun and relaxing space.
good,The Geek Squad at our branch really had some awesome people to work with. As with any large company Corporate decisions sometimes did not make sense working in the fray but mangers made it work. As a retail position Holidays are bananas of course. 8/10 Really good place to work.
good,My experience through the 5 years working at Best Buy was great I can honestly say its a great company to work for as your first job or a job to get you experience in understanding technology at a higher level then your average consumer.
good,"Great work environment entering a technology standpoint. Enjoying new products , testing out the latest things, and great employee benefits. Also very flexible with availability"
good,"Since working at Best Buy, I have developed a good relationship with many of my coworkers and managers. They understand that retail can be tough, so they do their best to make sure that it is more bearable through humor and motivation. The customers are a mixed bag. I have had several amazing conversations with fascinating people, but I often end up dealing with people who will yell at me because they are having difficulties with the technology they purchased (most of the issues are user error). Overall, I don't really enjoy the job, but I enjoy the people I work with."
good,"There are some downsides to working for a Corporation as big as Best Buy.  You have to work most holidays and time off can be hard to get at best, however they pay well for working holidays and mandatory overtimes. It was my experience that the people were fantastic.  We had a close family type culture and often tried to help each other out.  There was  a generous break room and everyone was on point with breaks and lunches.  "
good,"Great place to work, i recommend for all technology enthusiast. Love the management . Easy work life balance. Wish there was a little more pay, but who doesnt wish that about a job."
good,Compared to the 3 places I worked at. its the best so far. The communication isn't the best. Their are people that dont do there jobs like other places.
good,"extremely fun and welcoming environment                                                               "
good,"It is a good job, especially for a minor. It has its ups and downs, however, overall it turned out to be a great experience. Seasonal work is a hassle but overall I have enjoyed it."
good,"At my tine working at Best Buy, I was able to experience new opportunities from within and outside of Best Buy! You can focus different electronics and actually become a expert on that field, which you can take it to other life experiences."
good,Berry Buy is a great place to work; looking for full time employment with benefits. While I like working at Best Buy I need more hours and benefits; hopefully full-time.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"At Best Buy I always felt like I was pushed to be the best at my job. I was also given opportunities to advance and learn. Overall, I felt Best Buy was a great company to work for despite some minor management problems."
good,"Amazing staff and management, very involved and get the energy rolling. It was very fun and there were regular meetings and computer lessons that really help."
good,"buena empresa, pero algo bajo los salarios. La empresa se apega ala ley, con lo cual tienes buenos beneficios como fondo de ahorro, vales de despensa, dias flotantes y permisos.."
good,"A good job if you are looking for something flexible while in school, great benefits and perks. The job lets you create a reliable schedule and there's always room to grow if desired. Great for college students."
good,"Best Buy Mobile was an awesome place to work in college. We had an amazing team, pay was decent, and we always felt valued by the company. Customers sometimes would come in unhappy about their phone situations, but they usually left with a smile on their faces because they could tell we put the customer first!"
good,Fun atmosphere and great company to work for. The hours are extremely flexible and they make you feel like there is room for advancement within the company.
good,"This company was a great way to get multiple levels of experience in one place. Many skills such as people and conversational skills, teamwork and tech knowledge are gained from the work experience. They are very excepting of employees lives outside of work and are more then willing to work with you to find an optimal schedule."
good,it is a great environment and a great staff that is very supportive of one another. I would definitely recommend this job to somebody who is looking for work experience and needs to start somewhere.
good,great workplace to work at. GM are understanding and will help you with all problems that you have. There is a great discount program and if you are lucky you can get a further discount.
good,"Uno de los mejores trabajos que he tenido y me arrepiento de haber renunciado para arriesgarme por una invitación a otra empresa. Más de una vez he estado tentado a regresar."
good,"Lots of fun to work here. But amount of work and skill you use is not worth for the pay. This job requires skills, if you are just slacking off then its the right pay. But if you do it right, then you definitely deserve better. Still a good place to start retail career. Lots of things to learn and fun too."
good,"work is great easy work not hard at all but management is ok they expect you to make sales without customers even there. the benefits are great, PTO fro full time as well as great coworkers."
good,I was fortunate to have a GM who was able to change the culture of the store within 90 days and move it from a bottom performing store to a top 10 performing location.
good,"I enjoyed working at best buy. The only con was up-selling credit cards. It was in an area with mostly locals. You saw the same customers, if the location was in a more touristy area, I think i would have stayed."
good,Best Buy was a great place to work. But the hours just weren't enough until winter hit. I need a steady job with steady hours throughout the whole year.
good,"Best Buy truly cares about its employees. Plenty of training opportunities, and room for advancement as long as you are willing to relocate.Working for the company for over 9 years has given me tons of work experience, and ability problem solve, and take skills learned to future employment opportunities."
good,Geek Squad was a fun place to work and the people that work in that company are very nice. Pay was good for what we did and the work wasn’t extremely difficult in most situations
good,"great learning experience, management and staff was friendly and warming. scheduling was fair and left room for a balance school/home life. difficulty came with asking for time off"
good,A typical day would start by completing the Opening Duties Checklist. Then looking over the schedule to see what was coming in that day. We installed everything from Backup Cameras to Remote Starts. When the vehicle would come in we did a functionality checklist of all the electrical components. We would look at the new aftermarket components and give a quote for installation. We would then processed to to the installation. In down time we did cycle counts and restock our inventory. We would also go out to the Sales floor to sell and train sales associates. It was very fast paced during the Holiday Season.
good,"As I am currently working at Best Buy, my time there has been very pleasant. The work life balance is really good if you are currently in school and the tasks they have you do are relevant and educational to your job title."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I'm still new there so I haven't fully developed my sales skills yet, but I can tell you that if you want to best hours and the most praise for your work, you gotta meet their standards. People who don't make their numbers get less hours. Now I'm still enjoying the work and the people there really help make that possible, but I know I need to get better at it."
good,A great place to work for. The compensation and the benefits are very reasonable too. The overall training programs are great as you join the company and you get better at what to do along with time and learnings. Best Buy teaches how to be a human for customers.
good,"There Is never a dull moment, which makes the day go by faster."
good,"Working for Best Buy is a good place to work, if you allow it to be. Sure there are some things lacking that you would love to fix but they are not so bad."
good,I continue to enjoy working for best buy. Best Buy helped me to realize my passion in sales as well as customer service. I have created a career with best buy and hope to continue to excel as a sales consultant either through Best Buy or elsewhere.
good,"A typical day for me would be counting and balancing the register money in the morning as well as prepping the deposit for the bank. I would also lead the hiring process with phone screenings and bringing in possible applicants to be hired. Helped lead my team and designated tasks and ensured they've been completed, as well as troubleshoot defective equipment. "
good,Geek squad is a Great place to get work  experience  and great learning tools and some rewards for learning. Great for starting out in  job in technology  or as a secondary  or retirement  job.
good,"It’s a better job when looking for something more professional with good benefits. There’s plenty of room for moving up, and they will constantly check on your performance to help you improve on it. Best Buy offers bonuses for every position that includes sales, even for cashiers. The longer you work there, the better it will look on your resume."
good,"Company is numbers driven. Feels like you work commission when you are not. Great full time employee benefits for school, health, pets, and discounts."
good,"It was like having a new family rather than a new job. The atmosphere was inviting, energetic, and calm every single day you got to work there. I was in the computer department, but this seemed to be true of all departments."
good,"It’s a great company to work for. It’s like having a work family. I love it there. When the store profit, so does the workers. The stress is a minimum. Management works with you."
good,Best Buy had a very friendly staff and a great environment for me to start working in. I couldn't of asked for a better job to start out at and learn how to work in a retail environment.
good,"i worked part time last 2015, i've learned to have more patience from the customers. learn more technologies. good people friendly. the hardest part of the jobs is sometimes you have to worked more than 8 hours, specially on a sales event like black friday and boxing day. and having issue going to work that time because i don't have a car and io took a bus, actually is a big challenge on me. what i enjoyed is i meet different people in this job."
good,"Working at Best Buy was a very important stepping stone for me. I met a lot of great people, learned about technology, learned how to talk to people, and I was able to complete school. They have wonderful benefits and the best one is tuition reimbursement for full time employees. The discount is amazing too! Even though this job was wonderful to me, there was a great deal of stress because it can get pretty busy at best buy."
good,"Great work place. It was a job that could fit in any role, whether you were a student or someone who just needed a part time job. Very friendly staff and understanding managers."
good,"I came to Best Buy right out of college hoping to learn some legitimate job skills and advance myself professionally. Best Buy offers some of the most comprehensive training that I have experienced, and they seemed very interested in my success. All of my managers were helpful, my coworkers were understanding when I needed help, and I felt like I was part of the family very quickly."
good,"Management is very professional and friendly towards working staff. Understanding for mistakes, and genuinely great leadership."
good,I really loved working here. Everyone was really great. Good environment over all.  I learned a lot working here and working here made me a better worker.
good,Go in for the right reasons. You’ll make new friends learn new skills. Take advantage of what Best Buy has to offer. I kind of messed up by letting a manager make me quit. I definitely would have stayed.
good,"Great place to get an internship for a high school student, especially  if you're looking to work in the tech business in the future. I'm very happy with the experience that i gathered and would definitely recommend it."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Work would often be significantly easier because of fellow employees making the day go by faster, and are always willing to help if you need anything."
good,"The training I received at Best Buy is till some of the best I have ever received. Truly world class sales induction for a retail environment. Where you took it from there was your own prerogative. Managers at my store were extremely knowledgeable and helpful. "
good,"It's pretty fun to work here, each day is different of course but overall the employees and management at my particular Best Buy make working here enjoyable"
good,"Great work environment. "
good,It was a great place to work I loved working here the people were great. I just couldn't do the hours anymore after awhile it got too much but that's just because I was working teo jobs at the time.
good,"Best Buy is kinda like any other company out there. They work hard and really do look out for their employees. Selling can get a bit old if that isnt your thing but otherwise the competitiveness can really be fun! Pay and benefits are barely enough to keep you there, especially in the Bay Area. This job is more geared towards college students than anyone else. Management is pretty decent but is prone to bouts of nepotism. All and all its a good place to work."
good,One of the hardest jobs you can do in regards to physical demands. Will mentally test your desire to continue each day. Lots of things to learn throughout the warehouse. This job has gotten more relaxed and easier over the years but will always push you hard. Variety in jobs without the warehouse to try if you feel up to the task to learn.
good,"A typical day at work would include clocking in and immediately assessing the floor, seeing if any customers need help, and then attend to any stocking needs."
good,Best Buy as a company is a great place to work for. There is always opportunity for advancement and they really take care of their employees!! They even offer PTO for part timers now!!
good,Rarely boring and had alot of departments to cover but coworkers made the time fly bye. Worked on a daily sales goal but you do not work commission. I was seasonal
good,Coworkers are what made the job even better and a fun place to work. Management is a hit or miss on how they are. Loved and hated some supervisors. Pressure of sales goals was always there and it made the job not as fun. Otherwise great place to work.
good,"Best Buy is a good place to work. Good culture (diverse and inclusive) but limited room to grow in certain positions. "
good,It was a great place to work at even though it was only a seasonal job. The site that I worked at could have been leadership and co-workers that where honest.
good,good place to work. easy to learn and comprehend what is taught. the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and co workers. good job overall
good,"Collaborative and Nice Place to Work.Gained Niche Technologies , management and workplace culture.Help the team to achieve goals and have it delivered."
good,"A typical day at work is checking in at the start of your shift to see where you're standing as far as tracked information. A leader checks you in and you and your leader converse about your areas of strength and areas of improvement. Customer are main priority, that means dropping what ever task that is in hand to assist anyone who walks in for help. Gathering information from customers by asking questions that are related to what they need and what, and a few personal questions so they know we are there to sell them what's best for them and not for a quick sale. During down time, cleaning and organizing your department and zones, down-stocking product, studying promotions, sitting down in the training area to catch up on virtual trains and coachings, and flexing to other parts in the store to help out in times of a rush. The culture of the store is family-like. A majority of the employees work well with each other, communicate in and out of work, and are always looking out for each other. Toughest part of the day depends on management. Supervisors are down to Earth, friendly, always willing to help and set an example, though upper management pick and choose when they do so. Most enjoyable part of the work day is always knowing you're walking into a building filled with, what feels like, a second family."
good,I was attending the local college and they're super flexible with letting you create your own schedule. Great team leads and supervisors/ managers! It's one big family and you learn a lot
good,great place to work but the pay is not very good and the amount of work required from you is not even funny but that said all good in general do you home work before applying.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The salary and benefits are very competitive. "
good,"Not a bad place to work but retail is retail; associates took a lot of abuse from customers.  Management could have backed the customer service desk associates more in regard to returns.  Associates would follow policy then customer(s) would throw a fit, ask for a manager and sometimes the manager(s) would cave.  We felt it made the associates look bad and gave the impression that we didn't know what the company's policies were."
good,I truly enjoyed working at Best Buy. I made lasting friends and work connections that I use to this day. It’s retail so there will always be stressful days
good,Not a suitable job to pay for the cost of living. Great culture and was tons of fun to be able to help people with questions and give technical advice. Probably a good job for people still living with their parents.
good,Been able to move up rather easily in the company. You learn virtually through online courses. Schedule is flexible working sales. They do recognize the work you do.
good,"Ive worked at two bestbuys and the work place was nice, payed well, decent management however there was always alot of drama. Drama about work in regards to who did or didnt do what and drama outside of the work place being brought in. They have excellent shrink awareness."
good,"It’s a cool place to work if you plan to only be there temporarily. The CSR’s do a ton of work for the team, but hardly get the recognition or pay that is deserved. Other than that, you get great discounts on things in store."
good,"Worked my way to top Autotech in the company, and suddenly the bonus structure is changed. Now I'm left making less money, with no real advancement opportunity. As an autotech, you will learn quickly how to work by yourself without the assistance of anyone in your store. Annual raises are essentially just basic inflation rates and even top performers are only getting ~$1. Expect to cap out around the 4 year mark."
good,"fun place to work, the managers I had were great, learn new things and play with the latest gadgets.  Great culture, they do e learnings and I attained platinum status. hardest thing about my position was standing for 7 hours a day and making theft stops, best part visiting with people."
good,"Job itself is stressful, but the people you work with make it worth it. Management is caring, but your coworkers should care for you just as much. Working together as a team to reach daily/weekly/monthly goals."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work! I am in logistics so I don't really deal with store issues that much. Work life balance is perfect, leadership is understanding and cooperative if you have a personal issue."
good,Everyone is very nice and it’s great helping people in need of a computer or really anything. It’s nice knowing that when you help that person they go home super happy with their new product and can use it with ease.
good,Best Buy is a great place to work. The funnest job I've ever had. I've got the privilege of working and meeting a very diverse group of people and broaden my networking as well as my leadership skills.
good,"Working here was lots of fun and had potential to move up if I wasnt looking for higher education options. The GE at the store when I left was 23 showing how much the company will support you if you support the company."
good,"This was a fantastic company to work for, especially given my age and interests. I worked there from 18-21 and being interested in electronics, this place was a dream job. They paid very competitive hourly wages, and there was plenty of room to move up to department head, manager, etc."
good,Helped develop as a sales person and opened up opportunities. Goes through some pretty extensive training to make sure that you have all the tools you need in order to succeed.
good,My coworkers truly are the reason that the workplace is enjoyable. Everyone is usually in good humour and we treat each other as family. The hardest part of the job mainly would be the customers you ome into contact with.
good,The management was very well put together and the training process was very thorough. Nice place to work. A typical day of work consisted of talking to customers to see what their particular needs were and how we could best help them find what they were looking for.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Great work environment and atmosphere for someone who enjoys selling and being around electronics. Great management and coaching on sales techniques and training.
good,"I love Best Buy and their brand. I was a contract worker, and would love to extend, but don't think that may be a possibility right now, If an opportunity were to arise I would jump on it. Would definitely recommend this job to anyone."
good,"By far the nicest people I have had the pleasure to work with. It is a fun environment but also competitive. Best Buy brings in the most interesting people to work. They are funny, creative, helpful. They find fun ways to bring in competition in order to motivate sales in different departments. At every quarter ending a meeting is held were the company acknowledges they're hard working employees in each department. Only issue I had at my location is advancing into a supervisor/management positions. Lots of qualified employees are left behind to bring in friends from other locations. Despite the advancing process in the company which is available if you are willing to move, I would definitely do it again if given the opportunity."
good,Best Buy is one of my favorite places I've worked except for the days when I had to deal with angry customers.  The management was the most well rounded group of people I've known.
good,Great place to work if you want to work in sales. Management was amazing and so was the Supervisor team. If you want to advance in the security field there is not much growth.
good,I worked at Best Buy after separating from the military and completing my undergraduate degree. The management was superb and willing to work with my educational goals.
good,"I was brought on to the team as a seasonal employee and I had a rough start as I had only 3 hours of training prior to my first actual shift during Black Friday. Overall, it was a fun time but definitely wish i had more training."
good,"When you begin working here, you will receive a lot of training, so  your communication skills will improve. You have to work together with coworkers to solve problems and help customers. Product and service knowledge is absolutely key, but you can increase your knowledge as you go along. Overall, it is a really good, comfortable job."
good,Working at Best Buy was a great. The employees were great and so were the working conditions. The working hours were flexible which gave me the ability to enjoy things outside of work
good,It was stressful at time due to trying to hit your numbers for the day. Along with trying to get a certain amount of Best Buy credit card applications per month.
good,the job was easy and fun but the pay is terrible and also motivation is needed for the employees as there isn't many that stay with the company mainly because of the pay
good,excelente ambiente laboral y gran facilidad de aprendizaje apoyo a estudiantes a personas mayores la empresa no discriminas
good,The retail industry is rough but the coworkers at best buy were great and generally worked well together to help even the toughest of customers! The bonuses for certain departments were a huge plus.
good,Simple laid back job. I actualy enjoy coming to work. Its nice being able to play with all the new toys and gadgets. Manangement is cool and supportive. My only complaint is part time hours being low. But they do cater to my scheduling needs so I just deal with the hours they give me.
good,"If you're looking for a job that will teach you responsibility,  educate you, and to be very competitive, this probably the place to be. Especially if you don't have prior knowledge on electronics, but you want to learn."
good,Great top down management. You can tell there are so many individuals in the company that care for everyone below and around them. Excellent structure.
good,"I took on this job for the sake of having a stable job to get myself money after not really making a whole lot of it from my previous jobs. I think the bonus system rewards you nicely for meeting the goals that have been set for you. My team was willing to help each other out to help meet those goals. Helping customers out with getting them technology that fits their needs was overall pleasing, though not overly satisfying. Then again, I am not passionate about sales, I just get the job done, get my paycheck, and I am out."
good,"I had a blast with my time at Best Buy. You have to meet sales targets which can be challenging during slow months, but not impossible. Discount is fantastic. Must complete a LOT of e-learnings about new products, but overall is not difficult. No commission"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy is a productive and fun place to work at with plenty of new technology and services to learn about.Whether it is Geek Squad or the Salesfloor team, they are all great individuals to work alongside with."
good,C'était ma première expérience professionnelle et c'était très agréable et enrichissant.
good,"Many ways to learn about technology, and gain experience  with selling skills and help build confidence.  Good work environment.  Ability to learn skills for future jobs"
good,"As AP, I watched the store cameras, greeted customers and answered their questions, and checked receipts. There was also come correspondence with local police and detectives regarding criminals. Management is easygoing and wants you to succeed. Working amidst the newest technology is enjoyable and you can pick up a lot of talk from sales employees about products. The thing about AP is when it's boring, it's REALLY boring, but when you find someone attempting to steal, things get exciting."
good,"I invested 12 years of my life into Best Buy - and truly grew up within the company. I experienced so much, both personally and professionally in my time there, and still miss the work environment and the people daily."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Best Buy. It was a temporary job, but the work environment was fast paced, and I learned a lot.I spent most of my time with customers, duplicating the issues they were having with their devices."
good,"BestBuy is one of the places where you can work while having fun. you can also learn business strategies, strategic thinking, marketing skills, communication skills, team work and much more. most enjoyable part of the job is that you can be the first person to come across new technologies and learn about them and their applications."
good,The employees seemed to be very non-judgmental. Management always had your back when you needed them. On job training was excellent as long as you were willing to put forth the effort.
good,"The Company aligns compensation structure with the satisfaction of its customers.  Always looking to perfect the customer experience.  Holidays require a large commitment, but a fun work environment."
good,"Great Benefits, competetive sales environment. Opportunity to advance is there if youre willing to look for the chances. Not every store is easy to progress in."
good,Enjoyed working for Best Buy it provided me opportunities to learn about new products constantly.  Best Buy provides excellent benefits to their employees.
good,I worked for Best Buy for many years and truly enjoyed the job. It was a faced paced store. Keeping up with the changing technology of cell phones and phone plans kept us on our toes.
good,"My typical work days were fun, fast, and enjoyable for the most part.  I learned how to sale and provide great customer experiences.  As well as leadership experience."
good,"As a part-time employee Best Buy is, as of yet, the best job I have had. At my store, a majority of the managers were efficient and caring. The employee discount is great if you are a tech-nerd and the people at my location made the hours go by faster with their upbeat personalities and determination. Full-time employees get more benefits. As a college student, I am hoping to find a job more geared towards my future. I would recommend anyone with a drive to make customers happy while working with s great team."
good,"I love coming to work everyday, our company culture is very opening and welcome. Co-workers and managers are fun to be around. Sometimes the store can be slow but you can always find something to do."
good,"I had fun working there while it lasted, but of course there were things I didn't agreed in the work place, like for example, for any little detail they can fire you, like being tardy three time even if is five minutes, not meeting certain goals, not having enough hours in certain apartments and STILL hire even more people when knowing they can't afford, they say they're arent a competitive place but in reality is it, you may not have commission but you need to keep your ground because your numbers of sales, services or even interaction with customers counts for you to stay or not."
good,"fun place to work at as a first job, the benifits are amazing and the people are nice to work with, the pay is decent got three pay raised within the first year"
good,They care for and help their employees so they can improve and work in a comfortable work environment as well. They provide employees with information that can benefit their everyday lives.
good,"I feel I might have been a little spoiled. I had a great management team that really knew what they expected of you, and they knew how to relay those expectations to you.  We had mandatory trainings that usually involved sponsors (Microsoft, Sony, etc) that were actually a lot of fun to attend. The pay is decent (entry-level pays better than most retail stores, BUT they're losing their footing in that area) Overall I really, really enjoyed my time at Best Buy."
good,The entire experience overall was phenomenal from what is easily the best culture I've been apart of to learning how to sell more effectively. The management were very relatable and were very flexible when it came to any out of work issues.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I would normally be helping in making sure everything in the store looks good while being in the correct spot. If anyone needing anything checked or found I would be the person for the job. Everyone was also very friendly and would commonly hang out with co workers for board games and such after work.
good,"Best Buy is a solid company, that respects diversity in the workplace. Employees are treated with dignity and respect. They have places for individuals that just want a part time job, as well as those that wish to make a career with them."
good,"I believe a lot in best buy's mission, and selling customers solutions to make them happy is what drives me to be better. I think meeting people and having interactions with the customers is awesome but it leaves me asking myself if there's more opportunities for me outside of Best Buy."
good,If you're looking for a good place to start and build your career. Best Buy is perfect. You have the chance to grow and move up in the company if you work hard enough and show initiative.
good,"Management is great, not heavy handed. Tasks are easy. Very clean atmosphere. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for an easy part time - to full time position. They are paying $14.- $15. per hour for seasonal help."
good,"I specifically work in computers or Personal Computer and Home Office (PCHO). I honestly love working for this company, since it puts people at its priority. Although it is retail and the customers sometimes get to me, the good customer stories make it worth it at the end of the day."
good,"Un de mes premiers emplois qui a contribué à développer plusieurs compétences professionnelles."
good,"I've worked at Best Buy for the majority of one of my last semesters while in school. I wanted to work a part time job that I enjoyed while also paying well and giving me the hours I need. Best Buy hit all those marks and way more. I have fantastic job security, in part because the management seems well organized and it seems very much like a team."
good,The employee worked as one in order to help out customers. However in some occasions you would notice some employee are busy on their phones and this led to customers' dissatisfaction. However the best department was home theater who really helped out customers without any distractions.
good,We had a lot of fun working here. The employees were like a big family. We all worked hard to help each other grow in the company. I  would have stayed along with the company much longer if my location wasn't shut down.
good,Great work environment and friendly atmosphere. Advancements and promotions are based on work ethics and willingness to learn. I recommend best buy for opportunities such as personal and professional growth.
good,Best Buy is great company to work for they ware a very well run company. Has a great employee experience ensures that all daily goals are able to be reached. The Supervisors ensure that training is completed and all employees are trained and understand the company mission.
good,"You have to be willing to change procedures and add to your workday at a whim. You are in charge of your own advancement, don't expect a lot of help from leadership."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,good working environment and supportive management. Training provided to the new employee. Good salary and job timings. Easy task and able to be completed on time.
good,"A fun place to work,I learned alot about electronics,as well as the latest technology,managers are great and very supportive.Most enjoyable was holiday season,black fridays were awesome..."
good,"Working here for the holidays offered plenty of hours, schedule flexibility, and was very fast paced. Weekends were required but the discount was amazing."
good,"Great company to work for. Employees are the best part about the company. Team building events. Tuition reimbursement, bonus program, work life balance has gotten much better in the last year."
good,"It was ok when I worked there but you can't have Holidays off. That's pretty much it. But the overall working, pay, benefits  and everything was great."
good,"quick pacedMultiple titles including Best Buy Mobile Manager."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Great energy in the day to day workplace. Fun co-workers that are energized and determined to help customers needs. Great job for recent college graduates seeking career employment during the transition out of college.
good,"My market was great and I had a great district manager. Depending on market workload and pacing will vary. Some days you have 0 jobs, some days you have 8. Good time management is a must."
good,Good work environment. Focuses a little heavily on meeting sales goals instead of providing the best customer experience. If you like working with and selling electronics it would be a fantastic place to work at.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at BBY headquarters. The culture is amazing, very fast paced and values-oriented. There is not a lot of movement in middle management, so career advancement can be slow. Still, you work with very smart people and it was a good experience for me."
good,"I loved my job at Best Buy. Your team has a huge impact on what kind of day you'll have. Great discounts and incentives, and the health plan is great if you are a full-time employee. But unless you're a lead or above, don't expect this job to pay all the bills, especially if you have a family. Pay isn't so great hourly, but if you're willing you WORK HARD, advancement is always available throughout your district."
good,"A good work environment with a great discount and good pay. It is competitive, but you race against yourself more than other employees. Revenue and customer surveys will decide your yearly advancment. The management needs some work, but an overall good job to have."
good,Bon emploi pour les jeunes étudiants. Bonne adaptabilité au besoins des étudiants tout au long de l'année. Bon management.
good,"Good environment to learn and develop Selling skills, and become more confident."
good,"working at best buy was pretty cool and fun, until they begin to hire kids that start to involve each other with drama and gossip. Pay is low can't afford to live in San Diego with the pay. Manager promote who they like rather then who has the skillset."
good,"And my three years of experience with the Best Buy family. The co-workers have been fantastic, the management has been fantastic. But at the end of the day you can't make a career out of it because they won't let their Associates make enough money. At my particular store the pay range for the floor Associates can be anywhere from $11 to $16 an hour. But after asking around no one is being paid more than $13 an hour. Even the associates that have been here since the store has opened 13 years ago.  Don't get me wrong I love working at Best Buy but unless you make it into one of the 3 floor leadership positions it is impossible to support a family. Due to that fact I'm now looking for somewhere else to create a career."
good,Felt good going to work each day. Best Buy is a very dynamic company always changing. They are becoming more numbers focused than in the past but thats to be expected in the more competitive marketplace.
good,"It was a pleasure to work for the Geek Squad and learn many different aspects of not only the Install side but company side as well."
good,"Best Job I've had thus far, doesn't pay much but the work, the coworkers and the opportunities make it worth it. The management on the the other hand is uptight, self centered and a hassle to deal with. Got written for arriving 15 minutes late due to traffic, not an acceptable way to treat your top employees, life happens. Get four write ups and your done. Your going to be 15 minutes late every couple of months..."
good,Typical busy days. Enjoyed learning new processes and helping customers. Management was good but can improve on dealing with disruptive employees better. Very understanding. Job was great but co-workers were not. Overall culture could be better.
good,"Discounts and benefits for a seasonal position are pretty nice. You just need to be flexible with the hours given to you. Also, changes do happen so you will need to learn to adapt to changes, whether it’s change in product location or change in how things are done."
good,A typical day at Best Buy is fun and joyful. Learned a lot from the management team and fellow coworkers. A great first place to work in for my career path.
good,"Morning meetings and agendas, sales pitches, customer- to- product concern. Advancement is possible, but have to work hard, push oneself and excel competitively. Managers are usually groomed from within the business. Lots of customer attention and specific product recommendations. Great for college students or those looking for a career in Business/ Technology."
good,Best buy is a great place to work. A lot of really good people work there. I have tried working other places since and it just doesnt have the same atmosphere. Just wish there was more opportunity for advancement.
good,"Work experience was fast-paced. Customer support, and product knowledge is paramount.  Working in Magnolia was a learning experience.  Everyday new products being introduced, and you had to learn how to work each product so you could demonstrate it properly to perspective customers.  Co-worders were working as a team, and relationships continued out of work."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I was able to learn a lot of product knowledge while working as a sales associate at Best Buy. There were a lot of opportunities to make one on one connections with customers to really understand what their needs are and what their interests are. Hardest part of the job was trying keep up with sales numbers and credit card applications.
good,I love the interactions we have with customers and how we make life changing choices for them. we find what can help improve their everyday life and help bring them more into the now upcoming technology. It's a great field to learn new things and meet new people as well as get to know their needs and how it can improve their life.
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work. You are always busy, days seem to go by quick all the time. Management is always helpful, co workers are great to work with."
good,Best Buy treats employees very well and you have a lot of opportunity to advance if you want to. Weather that is in professional sales or in management.
good,"If you're looking to get your foot into the IT door, Geek Squad is for you. They give you the tools to more up in Geek Squad or the opportunity to seek other IT companies. Work/Life is great. If you have the right management. Need time off for something, they will gladly help you with it. With GS, it feels more like a family than a group of people you work with. Pay is OK, but like I said, you can get more by moving up or seeking other IT companies."
good,Best Buy was very fun and relaxed I had a great management team and awesome human resources . I actually miss the job quite much however I was offered a better opportunity.  This was by far one of the most funnest jobs I’ve ever had and work for Best Buy again if they moved to my area.
good,"If you are at a right store, sky is the limit. Loved working there when employees actually cared. Best Buy gives you the tools and offers much help but the location is what makes or breaks it. So location or environment makes a big difference."
good,Nice place to work. Low stress and fun. I was off the sales floor so it was more low key and just focusing on getting the products out and making the store look good. I liked my mangers for the most parts. I was mostly in charge of media and was to go to for anything media related.
good,"Best Buy was a great environment to work in. Every morning started off with a very motivating team member gathering. I learned how to work well with others, how to banter with customers, and how to sell."
good,best buy is a great place to work. managers are understanding and the work environment is joyous. the most enjoyable part of the job is definitely being around awesome coworkers
good,Being a geek squad agent allows you to not only work with people. but get a feel for working with computers in ways most people do not. This job gave me the experience I needed to move on from Geek Squad to my intended job field of computer security.
good,"To start your shift you would make sure you had all your tools ready to go to perform duties accurately. Also, check your goals for the day and the week to see what you need to do reach them. The workplace culture was fun and family oriented. It made working there enjoyable especially during down time. The hardest part of the job was that sometimes I could not help the customer."
good,All the employees I work with are nice and easy going. Whenever they needed assistance they were never rude. I would learn new technologies everyday I work there. I would recommend anyone to work at this BestBuy
good,"The typical workday goes by really fast and has a mix of different task based on the department that I am working in."
good,"Work at Best Buy is a fast paced environment with lots of opportunities for Advancement, If you need a set schedule not the place for you, Schedules change every week. You are tracked daily on sales or lack of, You are encouraged to push though the sale and up sale, Customer service is King and Profit is everything."
good,Lots of room for learning and self growth. Very personable managers if they have the time. Lots of young people both employed and in management. Very fun work place and always striving to be the best. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customer issues.Best part of the job is the people.
good,"Great working environment, amazing management and staff. Company mission drives all employees from top to bottom. Payed close attention to quality customer service"
good,"standard retail environment. great opportunity to learn the ins and outs of management- scheduling, shipping, receiving, training, Profit and Loss statement research."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I started at my local Best Buy when I was still in high school.  I chose to skip college because of what felt like the constant advancement I was achieving within my store.  Best Buy helped me grow in to store leadership, then offered me a corporate job at their office in Minnesota.  Once there, I still found myself advancing.  After 10 years, I owe every professional skill I have to Best Buy.  I only left because I received an offer that Best Buy was unable to match.  I definitely 'bled blue' and would love to return to work for Best Buy some day."
good,It was a great job with great coworkers and it taught me a lot about customer service and sales. It was also very useful because I learned about the products that I wanted to purchase.
good,"I loved the culture and the products.  Technology is so much fun, but the best part was the people.  It’s a team environment since they are not on commission, yet your department and store competes against other stores departments and against other stores as well."
good,"The management is great and understanding. For the most part everyone is on the same page. Beside's a few bad apples, we're all motivated to achieve the goals set for the day. Hardest part for most people is achieving the budget and attachment goals (example: sell 1 laptop bag with every 4 laptops). As long as your care about the client and you work in earnest, its really not a hard job at all. Morning meetings and working holidays isn't for everyone but at least they try to make it entertaining and provide breakfast."
good,The learning curve in the beginning is steep but after the first month on the floor I got the hang of it. Once you get comfortable with talking to customers the job is pretty easy. Management won't get on you as long as you are contacting customers and offering to help. I worked at best buy for two and a half years and it was by far my best part-time job. The discount is good and I would say the hours are pretty flexible too. The only downside is during the holiday season they might overwork you.
good,I wish I never lefted good work place ... grate environment! Loving people there ... great management... it’s a very punctual job have to be on time all the time
good,"Best Buy is a great company to work, the environment is good, but there are some things that make you selling experience tedious."
good,"Geek Squad is an amazing place to work, an amazing amount of culture and LIFE that is part of Geek Squad. Great coworkers and a broad range of Clients that you get to meet and work with from day to day basis."
good,Great for a starter job in sales. Best buy promotes from within and believes in building you up to be your best. They give you a lot of good benefits if your full time
good,Be  willing to help other departments meet there goals. As well as your own department goal. Best Buy is a team based company. So come on joine the team.
good,If you want to go work then play video games afterwards this is the place to be. Didn't have any issues working there. very easy going when compared to others.
good,"The work environment is great and fast paced, With lots to do at all tines. The back room allows someone to defiantly get the hang of the warehouse environment"
good,"Good culture, decent work life, hire from within.  Best buy culture (at least when I was there) was pretty good.  The starting pay is pretty lack luster though.   If money isn't an immediate issue I would reccomend applying to best buy as they have one of the best work cultures I've ever seen."
good,"Loved the whole team, both the store and my department. Average customer service work. The coworkers really make the job. Benefits are okay if you're part time, but it's better to be full time."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work especially for young hard working people. Good training for customer relations and to receive product knowledge beneficial for personal use and a stepping stone to future employment. If store management works to accommodate students with school schedules Best Buy is a great place to work. "
good,I only worked there for a couple months and it was a great experience I would come back because the customers and employees were awesome. I would tell a friend to work here.
good,"Best Buy creates a great work culture for their employees. They have amazing benefits, especially for their full time employees. On top of the benefits, this company has endless room for growth, you just have to be willing to put in the work."
good,"I would go into work and just go to the sales floor and approach customers and try to sell them items or help them. We had modules to do every now and then which helped with learning about new products and being well rounded on it to be able to sell it,"
good,It was a fun and productive place. I have learned a lot from Best Buy which have pushed me to be one of the best sales associate at my current job. A really nice place to work
good,A typical day at work was usually pretty busy. The staff was very friendly and helpful when I didn't know something. Everyone helped each other out no matter the department.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best buy has a very good culture and is a good place to start exploring furture career options later on in life. The atmosphere will get you ready to work harder and get promoted.
good,"Geek Squad is well known for its culture and how much it cares about its customers. It is a very fast paced job, and most customers are really nice. However, like any other retail stores you get all kinds of customers (clients as Geek Squad calls)."
good,Great place to work but not forever. if you are looking to advance in the company there will be several opportunities while you are employed at Best Buy
good,"typical day at work is helping customers making sure everything is clean and organized. I've learned a lot about technology, management is great at the store now. Workplace culture is great because of management team and co workers. Hardest part about job is dealing with issues out of your hands such as poor delivery. Most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy and satisfied with the products they leave with."
good,Such a fun place to work.  Surrounded by new technology.  Had a great time introducing new products to customers.  It was a very team oriented company.  Every morning before work there would be a bunch of cheering to get excited for the day.
good,"Best Buy provides all the tools for your personal growth and plenty of opportunities for career advancement. I learned how to run my own business and if I wanted to open up my own business, I feel that the mentoring I received along with all the tools they provided would set me up for success. Great company to work for!"
good,"I enjoyed working at Best Buy. Friendly Managers and Co-workers, fun environment, laid back atmosphere. Opportunity to grow with company. Always learning new things."
good,As a former employee of best buy I would say that working their were both a challenging and entertaining. i would recommend  the the next person to take the position.
good,"Being so into technology, Best buy provided me with the perfect setting for me to learn new things about new technology, teach me about customer service, sales, and how to deal with customers from day to day."
good,I learned a lot at this job. I started out as a line level employee and moved up the ranks. This job taught me a lot of discipline and respect. The most enjoyable part about this job was the employee's I worked with.
good,"This is a good job to start your career off in. It's kind of hard to move up or advance within the company because you can only do so when there is an opening. You could be the greatest salesman in the area, but if there isn't enough hours at your store for another full time employee, supervisor, lead, or manager, you're forced to look ato there stores. Days were pretty relaxed, the stress depends on which department you work in. Customer Service by far the easiest."
good,"Best Buy is/was a really good starting job. The employees are friendly and are ALWAYS willing to lend a helping hand. None of them ever bad mouthed, got angry or lost their temper with a customer. Although there has been some customers that lost their tempers with the employees and had to be escorted out. Best Buy has one of the best atmospheres Ive ever had working there. You walk in and you can feel the friendliness and hospitality in the air."
good,"If you work hard, opportunities will come and you will have to climb a store ladder but its worth your while if you can make it. Days can be stressful if you are not hitting your goals so you must be able to adapt to multiple surroundings"
good,The job is fun the employees are great to work with and there is always something to do I don’t really sit around and do nothing. Even when coustomers are there I can’t stop what I’m doing and help a coustomer out and then get back to work
good,"Fantastic managers and supervisors all around. Relaxed pace and comfortable environment. Pay is fair for the quality of work and amount of sales you accomplish. The only problem is the upper levels of management/supervisors are seemingly set in stone and there is no room for advancement unless someone quits or gets fired, no matter how great a job you do."
good,"Great discounts, work-school life, and job security! I would like to see an improvement within the job culture because it can be very bland depending what store you are working at."
good,"- Work life balance and flexible working hours :)"
good,"A great experience working and being part of the team, from having a collaborative and friendly team to excelling at our daily activities and sales goals for the day."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my work time at Best Buy. Great Co-Workers and great management. I only left for full time employment. A great work place. I would return if the opportunity arose.
good,"Working there was a good time and a typical work day was a full 8 hours, most of the time you will have to work weekends being big box retail, and management will always want you pushing more product and services out the door. If you are looking for a job that is secure in hours with great benefits this is a great place, however if you want to move up within the company it's a little hard to accomplish."
good,"Overall good place to work at. Opening just consisted of making sure everything was on and reviewing daily/weekly sales. Closing consisted of restocking everything on the floor for your department. Trainings are tedious but helpful. Management differs from place to place greatly and can make or break the job. The management I had for the most part was exceptional so it made the job a lot better. Co-workers really helped making the job easier and fun, but dealing with certain customers just like in any other retail job wasn't always the best."
good,"Best Buy is a great company to work for. I believe most of the employees work there because they all have the same shared interests in technology. Management and teamwork is different from store to store. Working for Best Buy can be as rewarding as you make it. Typically, if you are a hard worker and strive for greater things, you will be rewarded. Consistency to go above and beyond your job role is mandatory to move up in this company. There are endless opportunities to learn what you're capable of by working here."
good,"Tough requirement to meet, but there is a lot of support from managers to meet them. The hours are very flexible to it is a great job for  college student."
good,Best Buy is typically a great place to work. The employees are awesome and you gain friendship out of them too. The management genuinely cares for you and your advancement in the company or they help you outside the company as well. We always have fun while being the best.
good,"Fast paced environment, not too stressful, fun and exciting people to work with. Hardest part of the job is consitently exceeding financial and behavioral targets."
good,Good place to work if you need a low stress job with good benefits. Work schedules are very consistent. The pay is okay for the type of work you’ll be doing but most people work there while they finish school.
good,"It primarily consisted of helping customers with phones and helping them understand the plans. Also to help the customers pick out the right phone for them and there everyday needs. Further more to help them get accessories to compliment their phones such as; Ear buds, bluetooth speakers, car mounts, and etc."
good,Working at Best Buy can be fun at times. The work is good but pay is a bit on the low end for what the job requires. Much is asked for but only so much can be provided do to the location of the store.
good,I enjoyed going into work. I enjoyed what I did and the people I met. Management was always there to help if I had any questions and they were always supportive.
good,the whole job is like an entry level security job.  watching cameras and checking receipts.  occasionally logging in stolen products that other employees find throughout the store
good,There was definitely some stressful days mainly during the companies peak season but overall I loved working there. Loved my department and my direct supervisor was awesome.
good,"Basically you'd start off by writing down all your goals for the day, you'd zone around you department & assist any customers in need of help. Everyone has their own department that that they are in 7 so when you're helping customers in other departments is when you really learn about other electronics & such. I think the hardest part about the job was trying to push the credit cards we're required to push,for the simple fact that most people don't want it. Some of the things I enjoy the most is being able to find a solution for a frustrated customer & help resolver the issue. I think the biggest issue had to be management just because sometimes they weren't on the same page with each other & it would cause confusion."
good,An overall great place to work at if you're a student. Work-life balance is great and managers genuinely care about your well-being. Wish the pay was better.
good,"Typical work day: "
good,"In my two years at best buy, i started out as just a seasonal computer sales employee. I then got hired on as part time because I was in college. They are very reasonable with scheduling around my school schedule and as long as you work hard, it is very easy to move up into any position."
good,At times it was rather buy and we had our slow days which became our clean up days. I learned that when working at a job where alot of things may seem unfair you dont complain you cease the moment and continue to do great at what you are there to do and stay in your lane and where ever life takes you you have to roll with the punches because everything is not for everybody. At time management could have done better but over all they played there role. Work place culture was an amazing experience between celebrities and the different personalities that came in and out of Best Buy was interesting. The hardest part of the job was taking a break. I loved to work even if it meamt clocking in early or leaving late or working through lunch. The most enjoyable part was getting rewarded for the hard work and great customer service that i did.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Having worked at BBY Geek Squad from 2005 until 2015, I have a lot of experience at several of the New England stores. Building life long friendships, great co-working relationships, mostly great leadership and management, and a fast paced fun work environment. I truly miss working here, and am even thinking of applying part time to get in a few days a week at my local store."
good,"Not every day was too slow or too busy. I never knew what it was like working, but I caught on quickly how to properly manage everything inside and outside the job. The managers were always very helpful when I had questions. I loved working with every coworker that I had."
good,"Fantastic place, work hard and the company will treat you well. However, if you stop caring or begin to slack off, you will notice a change towards you."
good,"Good place to gain sales experience. This is a fast paced, competitive environment. It is a great place to begin learning sales. Before this job, I had no sales experience. In just a few months, I my sales skills improved greatly. The only downside is they don't teach product knowledge enough, so there were many times where I didn't know much about the products I was told to sell."
good,"reforcé mi conocimiento de entradas y salidas de inventario ,además de aprender sobre la seguridad del mismo"
good,I worked at Best Buy while I was still in high school back in 2014. This was my first job and honestly one of the best. We did monthly activity challenges where once I won an iPad for selling the most credit cards.
good,"This is a great company to work with. The mornings can be a bit slow, but the store opens at 10 so at least you don't have to wake up extremely early. Working in customer service can be a bit stressful but that's true just about anywhere. The store leaders are amazing and always stand by their employees, if customers are rude and offensive our management will not tolerate it. Best Buy definitely makes you feel part of a family."
good,"Working in inventory leaves you on your own to develop problem solving skills, prioritizing tasks quickly, and working under pressure. The company enforces punctuality, but embraces phone usage for business needs which is progressive."
good,Best Buy is great company to work for. I learned to work and help all kinds of customers needs. You will be on top of technology which is the hard part of it. However best buy makes it fairly easy to do so with monthly training you can take at your own pace. The most enjoyable part of it is being able to provide excellent customer service by offering a complete solution to your customers needs.
good,"I enjoyed working at Bestbuy.  The environment was fun, the staff were great to work with.  The benefits for full time staff was very good.  The discounts were great.  I found it challenging not to spend all my salary buying items."
good,I was busy with school at that time and had to find a job where I could work temporarily and have flexible hours. It was primarily a seasonal job that lasted for as long as I needed it to.
good,Great job for young person whether or not they want a career or just some money on the side. Job is good for team building and getting experience in customer service and electronics which is experience you can apply pretty much anywhere.
good,great place for teamwork & they allow you to grow. All managers were available to answer questions. Problem solving is a big plus & you have to work fast paces as well
good,"Lots of fun to work for. Great interactions with customers, talking about new tech and getting excited about it with customers. Was able to move up and get raises multiple times throughout career and could have kept climbing the ladder if I stayed at my location. Management is goal oriented but fun and tries to keep employees involved."
good,"A regular day at work would be me saleing atleast 500$ worth of merchandise`i woud take my lunch around mid shift walking around meeting, greetings, and helping people"
good,"If you're looking to talk about technology and assist people in their  needs, Best Buy is for you. Unlimited options to learn and multiple ways to advance."
good,BestBuy is a great place start out and gain sales and life experience to where you can continue to work your way up through the ranks or that you can take those skills with into your future
good,. I loved working there simply because the pay was good for the amount of work its very relaxed. great people other than the current gm at the tyler store not very friendly with employees.
good,"-  A typical day here was steady"
good,it's a good place for people that want to start an IT career. But have no job experience. the every day job will teach you everything you need to be able to find a better position on the future.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,You have to be on top of your game but as long as you are working you can fun and develop connections with customers and other co-workers. Also its cool to learn about all the new technologies coming out.
good,everyone always with communication over the walkie and the team getting to reach their team goals that is set for them. sometimes it is slow but then we clean and if it busy we try to help everyone as much as we can.
good,"There is a sense of team unity and family, everyone supports each other so the job can flow seamlessly. There is an opportunity to learn a lot through e learnings though most materials are tailored to other departments."
good,Best thing about Best Buy for me is they made it really easy to work there with my school schedule. Managers were always very accommodating and only asked as much from me as time would allow. Very easy place to work while in college.
good,"Good company to work for, the managers are nice and the culture of the company is great also. They always encourage you to be part of the team and stuff. It is nice, but when they are paying you $12/hour and no commission you don't really feel like you are worth something. But that's just the nature of the business. Retail is dying and they will be only a few players left in the coming years."
good,Most days are quite relaxed but quite goal oriented with a focus on driving results. You will learn very quickly how to problem solve for customers so that you don't waste their valuable time. Management can be quite unpredictable but as a whole they are caring about their employees. Almost everyone in the store is in an extremely friendly basis and only a few people ever rub anyone the wrong way. The hardest part of the job is making sure you deliver a quality solution to the customer even if they may be agitated. The greatest pleasure is seeing return customers who ask for you specifically so that you can meet their needs once again.
good,"Great company overall. You will learn a lot and you have the opportunity to play with technology."
good,"Perfect for those looking for an opening into the field of IT. You get hands on experience with multiple devices from IOS to Windows 10, 8.1, 8, 7, and Vista."
good,I was doing part time work and thought it was great for the time being there. Overall a great place to work. I really liked the discount I got but really felt like I should get paid more.
good,"Working with the public but in an environment focused on growth. I have learned a lot about technology and how to function in a team. Very competitive, have to stay on top if you are to advance or keep getting hours. Very rewarding job when recognition is given and when you meet people's needs, almost everyone respects Best Buy employee's informed opinions."
good,"Was responsible for inventory, unloading truck products. Setting up product displays, and vendor displays, while also pricing products and making sales adds. Assisting customers, sales, and warranty replacements."
good,Working in sales was great! You learned a lot about the current technology everyday and was always helping in the customer service department. Also constantly meeting new people.
good,Co workers were great and got along perfectly. The management cares about the employees and customer. The work environment is great and helped with sales as well.
good,"Great place to work, but just as any other sales place depends on the local staff and managers. My location was also pretty slow, but we are on the lower end of store sizes."
good,working in inventory was actually very nice and smooth. management worked great were very understanding and co-workers were laid back and extremely nice.
good,"Great place to work. Fun crew and great employee discounts. Job is full of opportunity. Stocking, customer service, geek squad, comp-car tech, and home theater to headphones."
good,Working with Customers on a day to day basis is something you get accustomed to. I learn how to maintain proper work ethnics and provide them the best Options for their services. What I enjoy the most about working their is the customer satisfaction. Knowing that I was able to help them brings be great joy. What I can say is most difficult about this job is some cases where its not as simple as setting up new phone lines. Management is well structured and they encourage us to provide the best experiences for our customers.
good,"Stocked shelves, moved displays, built new displays, unloaded trucks and helped customers with TV's and appliances to their cars. Changed prices on items as sale papers changed"
good,"Enjoyed working and learning Logistics.  Best Buy was fast pace which in turn kept me always thinking a step ahead.  The opportunities I received at Best Buy were huge assets to my career.  The hardest part of my job was ""Peak Season"".  I was on 2nd shift with 3  young children, single parent and worked 6 days a week with  very long hours to guarantee products were packaged and loaded on trucks for delivery to customers.  Once ""Peak Season"" (October - March) was over, I was able to return to ""Day Shift"".  The start of day we held safety meeting,and daily work load meeting.  Daily I figured my staffing of my department based on units of product ordered.  We worked using ""Lean Initiative Production"".  It was important to prevent as much waste as possible.  Management, for the most part was great.  I learned so much from other supervisors along with upper management.  Keeping my department on task was a daily activity.  Learning to work with people with different outlooks on life helped in understanding individuals and their purpose for working."
good,Ultimately not a bad place to work. It is very much dependent on the co workers you have as in any job. If you enjoy speaking with individuals and like electronics you will like the job
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I enjoyed working at best buy. You always meet new people and there is always plenty of things to learn about, they have decent advancement opportunities. The only downside is it is really hard to go full time there and you have to stand on your feet all day."
good,Best Buy  had a very fun culture which included contest for the employees and fun promotional events. There was also a very generous discount program for employees.
good,"Fast paced but very helpful to people, and i love to help out when i can! i learned things about compliance that my knowledge was numb to at first. My management there was awesome i really enjoyed my manger and the time i was there because i was constantly involved with people."
good,"Good entry-level sales job to gain experience in sales and customer service. Employees must greet all customers and help them to find the correct products for them, and try to upsell on each purchase."
good,"Best Buy offers incredible amounts of benefits, even for part-time employees. Management is good, pay is decent and the people you work with tend to be pretty outgoing and social. The only downside in my opinion is a not very flexible schedule that would fit with my school schedule."
good,"I don't have many issues, every job has there ups and down but overall Best Buy is a pretty good company to work for. Will never regret it. My aunt and uncle works for the company and my father was a recent General Manger of one the their stand alone Mobile stores."
good,Working at best buy was great there was always opportunity for advancement. There is training in any department that gave you the opportunity to move around the store to gain knowledge of the company as a whole versus just your department. Only part that I did not like about working there was the inconsistent hours and some management having a preference of employees I believe all employees should be treated and disciplined equally.
good,"I absolutely love working here, the amount of on the job training is absolutely fantastic. The only thing I would say is a downside is that raises are minimal. The average work day, there's always things to do. Discounts are fantastic, benefits are amazing, and the hours are flexible. Probably the best management team I have dealt with in my experience"
good,I love this company and would not leave it if i didn't have to. If i could transfer i would. I wish the company was better at helping with transfers. other then that i love the company and think its awesome and would recommended it to everyone.
good,la descripción de mi puesto fue principalmente reparación de los equipos pero también consistía en la administración de la base de datos de los clientes así como llamarles para ofrecerles descuentos y mantenerlos al tanto de los tiempos de servicio de sus equipos
good,I enjoyed working here. Working in merchandising you deal less with people and more with the look of the store. If you work in sales you have to learn how to help customers with their needs. Depending on the store the management can be really well driven and the coworkers can feel like family.
good,Loved my time there. Management was very nice and cool. Very relaxed yet quiet fast paced. Didn't get as much hours as I would've liked though. Had to move out of state.
good,Great place not to many issues. Sometimes favoritism happens but normally as long as you perform nobody cares too much what you do. Great with working with people schedule once you get in
good,Its a good job but raises come every year if anything. culture at best buy is great! best managers ever and best co workers ever. pay is ehh... but the discounts you get are outrageous! great place to work
good,Working there was fun and enjoyable and had great benefits as long as you kept your numbers up and really enjoyed up selling to people. But they never asked you to do anything that wasn't agreeable.
good,"Was hired seasonally and became a full employee after the season ended.  Interesting Job, Started in the camera department and moved to computers later on."
good,"Best Buy est une excellente expérience, que ce soit sur le plan évolutif ou social "
good,Offers great work life balance and culture.  Very hard to advance and or be promoted if you are corporate employee.  I have learned that you need to own your career and don't rely on others.
good,I left this job because after we got lots of seasonal workers for the holiday season. Some of them were offered to stay on longer. Best Buy likes to have lots of part time employees to avoid giving benefits. Getting full-time is very difficult.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"My days here were consistent of assisting customers find their perfect in home theater system.  I learned a lot about the ins and outs of perfect cables, sound systems and how to properly work those things.  Management was a blast to work for and I liked everyone i worked with.  The hardest part of the job I would say is the goal for the day, sometimes it'd be incredibly simple to hit, especially for working a night shift. But if you got stuck with a morning shift, it was almost impossible to hit the goal if you worked in specific departments.  I enjoyed the experience with them."
good,"Great people and benefits. The work environment is great. It's a great career for indivuaks looking for stability and a start. The staff is awesome, and so are the discounts"
good,"While the pay wasn't great, almost everything else was. Management listened, supervisors were reasonable with time off. You are worked as if you are commissioned, which can be stressful at times, but follow your training and keep good communication with your supervisors and it can be a fun and interesting job."
good,Best buy was a great and fun company to work for!! management was nice and understood if there was an emergency or sickness with in the family. over all great place for employment
good,"Can be relaxed if there are low amounts of Clients' devices checked in, but normally it is fast pace with the amount of work that has to be done. Great environment though."
good,"I have noticed reviews vary by store. I also know people in other stores that have totally different experiences. Thankfully my store I consider it to be one of the better ones or at least above average. Management for the most part is good. Good work environment, decently fun and great for a part time college student like myself."
good,"Basic retail job with a technological bent; knowing about consumer electronics (PC, Mac, smartphones, TVs, appliances, etc.) helps; management was organized and pushed all staff to always try harder"
good,"If I told you it was easy, I'd be lying.  However, if you are looking for a challenge and ways to grow, Best Buy IS that company.  My role was in management, and (to date) its the best job I've had.  But like any other occupation, you only get out what you put in."
good,Every day was different. Dealing with customers personally was a delight. Management was great they worked with me on everything. I developed my skills as a worker while being there.
good,Currently work in a Virginia store.  Management at my store are very supportive and working part time has given me a great work/life balance.  Pay is also above average.  Overall I love working here!
good,"Received and correctly processed both written and verbal instructions, prints and work orders."
good,Best Buy is a great company to work for and has a lot to offer to their employees. The environment is fast paced and not for everyone. But nonetheless it is a great place to work and learn a lot regarding business development as well improve your communication skills.
good,Geeksquad is a very friendly place to work. Management is fair and all the tools are easily accessible. Times can get very demanding though and the pay does not make up for that. Raises are nearly impossible and moving up in the company is very painful.
good,A great place to learn and grow your knowledge of a retail/consumer level business accumen. Flexible scheduling. Management that encourages family-style leadership however a strict reprimand system which enforces productivity and growth.
good,Outstanding benefits and management. It was hard dealing with so many angry and demanding customers. The training was very in depth and helpful. Overall I would recommend.
good,empresa que da lo mejor se si parque tenga un equilibrio entre clientes empleados.
good,"The ins and outs of my work at Best Buy was learning about the computers, assisting customers with their purchase and meeting the monthly quota of sales."
good,"Quality employer with great long term vision. One of the last remaining retail giants, and easily the best of them to work at (except maybe Costco). You will never get rich in sales with Best Buy, but if you are envisioning a management track, this is a great place to make a fair buck if you're willing to work hard."
good,"Every day there is a routine and guide on how to plan your shift. I was working at one if not the busiest precinct in the DFW metroplex. I am very fortunate to have a very understanding and fair manager, it is not the case for other precincts nor other departments in the store. The culture is like no other and you are held to a higher degree of responsibility with the perks of a well-respected position. The hardest part is having to push for sales when it may not be necessary. I have been doing sales for years and this is a little different since I can offer a lot of help with a sale, however I am more for helping the people than making a quick buck. The most enjoyable thing is my coworkers and the environment of my precinct. From what I have seen we have a good mix of being laid back and chill with getting work done and doing very well."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Being a CA (consultation agent) and then becoming an ARA (Advanced Repair Agent) you learn that you need to be precise with what the client is saying and what they mean. Ensure that you write down exactly what the customer says, and what you find when looking at the computer/tablet/ etc. That way, we can focus in, and ensure that their unit is in working order according to the customer. "
good,Awesome company for advancement. I was hired for sales and quickly moved up the ladder to Department Head and then to Senior Installation Tech for Car Audio/Security.
good,its literally everything in your job description and more. its fulfilling at the end of the day if you are working with a good team and in a good department.
good,"Company is amazing. They teach you how to properly sell and teach you about the products in the store. Give great discounts to employees. Only good hours for full time employees, part time get very minimal hours."
good,"Honestly it was great in the beginning. As I past a year of working there, the mangers (two actually) started treating me differently and why I left.."
good,Worked here for almost three years and two different stores during that time. Both stores were different in their own way but both had great culture and an awesome environment to work in.
good,Good place to work at a lot of nice friendly people caring the management is really good and the culture is a great. the enjoyable part would be being able to help people.
good,"In my six years of experience being with the company, I worked with around five different general managers, and six different assistant managers. With this being so, I have seen a lot of different personalities with management, employees, and even customers. My experiences there helped me grow as a leader, and sales person. Being there taught me the importance of making people happy."
good,Best Buy allowed me to work with a diverse team of co-workers.  The management was great for the most part.  I enjoyed mulitalking and interacting with customers.  I ran a cash register as well as helping on the sales floor in the media department.
good,i have worked here for 3 years. People are great but the management is no where close to the best i have had. Could use better people in those areas. Pay is getting better though.
good,Great place with great management. The people here really do make a difference in the work environment.I really enjoyed working with people who make the place welcoming.

good,I started working for Best Buy when I was 16 years old and have just graduated college and I am still employed by them. Best Buy has been a great place of employment for nearly 7 years and would recommend it to a large variety of people.
good,"Flexible schedule if time off is needed for personal matters. Very one is treated fairly and with great deal of respect."
good,They train you very well at your job and the pay you for your training as well. Great experience ! You get to talk to customers and explain what is the best choice and we are allowed to help them find the best choice and what is needed to make them happy.
good,"When you work with Geek Squad, you are put into the culture. You become part of the family. Always there to help each other, and friendly until you leave."
good,"Overall, Best Buy was a good place to work at. Managers were pretty supportive and knew what they were doing. Motivated employees to meet sales goals effectively."
good,"The job is what you'd expect it to be, you don't get paid the best, but it's fun work for anyone into tech. It makes a great second job as the managers are pretty flexible with scheduling. You only work as much as you can. Good atmosphere and I met a lot of good friends working there."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.

good,The management for Best Buy is very well trained and professional. They find a way to make your job work for you with the right encouragement and with the right frame of mind. Overall the work environment is great to those who are looking to work at Best Buy.
good,"I enjoyed working here in high school because  it worked with my school schedule and they paid great for the time being. All my co-workers were nice and the job was very easy the only thing i wasn't a fan of was the managers. The mangers had these delusional goals that everyone walking through the door wanted a credit card and insurance and they you had to sell it to them, and they would constantly stand over your shoulder to make sure that you did so. Quite irritating."
good,Typical days are just ringing out customers at the register as a cashier. As my fist job it taught me a lot about customer interaction and general workplace culture.
good,"Best Buy is a great company to work for. "
good,"I worked here for about 2 years, if you stay on top of what you have to do it will be easily noticed considering that there are a lot of lazy people at times."
good,"Every day I would go in and had to meet a required revenue per hour for the day, as well as a branded payment per month requirement. I would walk around my area and talk to people about different products and convince them to buy as well as the protection on it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,Best Buy is a fun place to work the discount is crazy good they are very understanding when it comes down to scheduling issues they also have after work events to bring employees closer together
good,tiene todas las cosas que busca un estudiante para superarte horarios flexibles de hecho es una empresa que si recomiendo tiene su beneficios son flexibles
good,"I've been with Best Buy since 2004. I have made close friends, lasting relationships with customers, and have learned a great deal about retail and people management. I have gone from occasional seasonal to multiple supervisor and lead positions. Which brings me to my only negative rating: the advancement area. As a company they had eliminated every position I've ever held. Minus the one I currently hold."
good,I love technology and being able to help people on a daily basis as well as meeting new people and my job allows me to do just that. The people that I work with are like family and being able to work with great people as well as be around what interests me is an awesome thing to have in a job.
good,"Great group of people to work with and great management personnel.  Stern, but also allow for anyone to pitch in ideas to make improvements.  Helped me to stay on my toes in the area of technology, which is always good when it comes to a field that changes everyday."
good,"the hardest pasrt about working with best buy are the hours"
good,"Really love working for Best Buy, the management at my store could be a lot better. Co workers are awesome and really some nice people. I honestly love the actual work. I work in the administration office so I am in charge or scheduling interviews and hiring also counting all the money as well. I really love it and it pays really well."
good,We look to give legendary service to each client that comes to the store. Work as one to achieve a goal and have our clients continue to shop at Best Buy and refer us to their fellow friend.
good,I have really enjoyed my time at Best Buy. I love being surrounded by technology and things I enjoy. Sometimes the company doesn't do a great job at allowing young associated to move up because of age
good,"A typical work day was pretty uniform actually, you get your order and you go through the warehouse creating the order organizing the merchandise on the skids. Then you drop your orders off at the designated bay/port, we also had to some product which would need to be organized since it was picked up in bulk and then moved to the correct bays. A big thing I learned at Best Buy was whether you do your job correctly and efficiently effects everyone in the warehouse so you going slow or making mistakes had an impact everyone in the warehouse and even the stores themselves, so working in a team was a big deal. the workplace was a great environment everyone was friendly you worked with many different people in the warehouse, there was always work but there were days where there was tons of work so you did need to be very fast pace at times. What I liked most about the job was that everyone worked together and communicated."
good,"Si entras desde la posición de Medio tiempo ganas miserablemente $1,350mx por 5hr 30m de trabajo."
good,"I currently assist customers with their products, and any questions they may have. Our management is great and very helpful. If I have any questions, they always assist me, and make sure everything si going smoothly. The most challenging aspect about my job is assisting multiple customers at the same time, with different needs."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The people you work with is biggest reason people stay pay is ok, but management can be kinda hectic at times, the way it rolls down can sometimes seem like their interested in their own gain or bonuses. Competition among associates seem like the best way to motivate employees."
good,It is a great place to work especially if you like electronics and the newest gadgets. The leadership is ok too. Overall a good place to work but expect to work.
good,"When I first started working at Best Buy, I felt so at home. You got a huge smile on your face when your walked through those doors. You begin to come close to your co-workers and managers. You're a big family that looks out for each other and when you leave, they have company get togethers."
good,"Emploi très stimulant."
good,"I've learned great customer service skills and sales skills, improving my skills progressively as I work there. A typical day will be restocking shelfs with units, putting some devices on demo displays, consulting customers with products and recommending services that will benefit them. As well as cleaning the tills and display areas when the store is closing. The management is fantastic, as they listen to my recommendations and concerns I might have. The hardest part of the job is when there isn't much customer traffic through the store and meeting the sales goals we want to reach.

good,"Best Buy is pretty good depending on your position, and location. I was comfortable at mines and enjoyed helping customers."
good,I typically like my job it was diffrent bein gon the other side of selling verses buying something.

The management was top of the line if we had an issue they took care of it before it developed into an issue.

good,"Fun place to work at because being around technology. I learned how to meet sales quotas, how to sell with a purpose and how to close a deal. The management was hands-on they would be working as hard as their sales staff that drove morale up in the store. Workplace culture was very upbeat, fun and ever-changing. The hardest part was having a slow-peak in business. The most enjoyable was being around technology, learning about new products coming into market and building relationships with clients/associates."
good,"Management was great at coaching people with bad sales, and if you could not improve they would move you instead of firing you."
good,"As a team leader it is my job to make sure my department is running the necessary skill set in order to drive the business.

I have 3 going on 4 years of customer service, and over well a year and a half working in sales. I always make sales goals and offer the solutions for my customers as well.

good,"I did not work with this company very long, but when I was there, the management was very good. They taught you how to sell very quickly, the pay was fairly nice along with opportunities for commission."

good,"the job itself was pretty average for retail, but my coworkers really brought out the best in best buy. There was such a feeling of solidarity throughout the group, I have made lifetime friendships that I will forever treasure. Working customer service is tough, but rewarding. The managers here are amazing, very relatable and approachable. Even the upper management are very down to earth and really value each and every employee. Part time hours are very random though, often times my schedule bounced around between morning and evening shifts several times per week. Days off were never consistent. All in all, despite the stressors and frustrations, this job was the best I've ever had and I loved every moment of it."

good,"Geek Squad has been a huge asset to my family. They have worked with my schedule between a second job and school so that I was able to maintain a full-time job, a part-time job, and go to school full-time. Typically, out 20% of the day is spent helping customers with the usual IT issues. Occasionally, someone will walk in with a more extensive problem, but usually my time is spent teaching customers about basic computer skills. The other time is spent certifying returns so that they can be repaired or resold."
good,Best Buy was a fun work experience. The job is deeply rooted in interpersonal skills and how well you can deliver on customer expectations. The people are always welcoming and everytime I have worked for this company I have immediately felt like part of their collective family. If you are looking in retail I don't think there is much better ttan this company!
good,A great and fun place to work. The atmosphere is uppity and the people there are great. Your shift feels like it goes fast since there's always a job to be done.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Une journée de travail chez Best Buy s'était entrer dans un lieu de travaille ou que les employers étaient très accueillants .Une bonne esprit d'équipe .Le travaille que j'avais a accomplir était facile mais je trouvais qu'il y avait beaucoup de pression sur les ventes . Chez Best Buy il a pas de commissions donc je n'appréciais pas la pression sur les ventes . Malgré la pression j'aimais bien aller travailler . Les conditions de travaille était formidables , vraiment une belle atmosphere . C'est un bon travaille !"
good,The job was fantastic and management was amazing. My only issue was being forced to resign due to not having a car to attend a sales training seminar after being there for 5 months.
good,best buy has a fun work place environment. the employee discount is one of the best I have seen. I was only a part time associate but you get the same benefits as a full time associate.
good,"this company cares about its employees. retail is tough, retail is even tougher if you work for a bad company. Best Buy makes the job fun and teaches you important skills that you will use in future work"
good,"This job is not IT, this job is sales, and if you run into someone who is knowledgeable in IT than consider yourself lucky. Everything I learned at this job was either self taught or from one other person who is no longer with the company. Great work environment, friendly people, good compensation for full timers and you get promoted easily if you show competence, but it is an issue once you hit management, you hit a wall unless you really try to negotiate your way into corporate, which doesn't happen often."
good,"nice,friendly work environment.all the co workers are really nice and helpful. what i really liked about this job is no dress code and the environment is very chill."
good,A typical day could consist of  setting planograms moving / building gondolas  wiring and rewiring of electronic fixtures  with my team of people . I learned a lot of troubleshooting  skills here along with the continued demands in a semi leadership role  all of my co-workers would agree that  I try my best to gain a connection to all of them due to our line of work and the closeness it requires because our job  requires  us to travel 85% of the year . My hardest day on the job is were we had to set up a full sales department with little to no instruction and supervision  . the most enjoyable aspect of my  job is the learning curve that is introduced with every new project that me and my team take on  also the travel to a new territory  is a plus .
good,A typical day at work involved a an equal amount of physical labor and customer service. Team work was essential and developing good interpersonal skills was key to success both with  customers and fellow employees. Met a lot of interesting people in different phases of their lives and learned much from them. Management was the key difference between a store that ran well and one that struggled. Hardest part of the job was the time demands especially during the holidays. Best part of the job was the benefits that even part timers are eligible for. Better than a lot of places at a similar pay level.
good,"GeekSquad NL is een leuk bedrijf waar je veel kan leren, ook de werksfeer is erg goed en gezellig."
good,"Typically, it's a consistent normal day at work, where we are put at stations. So in the front would be cashiers, customer service and MCSA. All co-workers get a long."
good,Have a good time here lots of perks to this job. scheduling can be rough at times. Overall though a good company especially compared to all the others out there when you go looking.
good,Really enjoyed working for this company.  They have multiple benefits to help you succeed. And its an overall fun enviroment.
good,"Enjoyed the culture and my teammates"
good,Fun and educational place to work at. Co-workers were great fun people to work with. Also very educational with technology and programs. There had been a lot of changes as well as a closed store with three years.
good,"Non commission shop that is run like a commission shop. If you work in a department that has light traffic, then you have to move around and try to sell product you are not even trained to get personal numbers, even if your department has low numbers because of low traffic, you will not. Does not always work"
good,"There's always something to do and learn, management is very encouraging about development and growth. My co-workers are friendly and always helpful. I love working with the people."
good,Great place for a working college student.  Very flexible with scheduling and work with students a great deal on benefits.
good,"Overall, the company has great culture! It's always fun to be at work and sell the latest technology. The pay is very fair and the benefits are great! 401k w/match, health, vision, dental."
good,Learned how to sell the proper way also found out that I love working with other people. The hardest part of my job is dealing with other employees who they do not think I know anything about the products.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy Canada cares about its employees and makes it painfully aware that the interests of its employees are the primary concern for the company. Through benefits and opportunities for advancement within the company, Best Buy offers a constructive atmosphere to generate a prosperous career. The work atmosphere itself is great, especially with like-minded individuals as coworkers and colleagues. The only downside to the company that I find lately is that the work environment itself is not associated with my career interests, and that I must expand outside the company to seek the type of experience that will assist me later in my professional career."
good,"Great Part-Time Job, great management, great team work. Also great part time for holiday time. Good management training, gear to help with training."
good,"Typical days had their laid back moments and very busy and stressful moments, I learned customer service skills extensively. Working at Bestbuy improved my public speaking abilities and overall people skills by far. I also learned how to negotiate well with people and how to make an angry customer leave happy. Management was usually always friendly and very helpful, they provided extensive training with feedback to let you how you're progressing. Bestbuy tends to hire positive, outgoing and friendly people so the overall work environment is very positive. The Hardest part about working at Bestbuy would be Christmas season and boxing day, the Stores extremely busy and stock runs out fast which people are not happy about, but when you're good at finding alternative solutions it makes things much easier, though busy and sometimes difficult it can be fun in a challenging way. The best part about working at Bestbuy was always being up-to-date with the latest in entertainment technology."
good,"it is a great Company, Just sometimes, the management requires you to do much more than expected, nothing is ever sufficient for them."
good,"Most enjoyable part og my day would be engaging with customers and learning who people are. There is always someone new, and there is always new knowledge to gain from people such as their background, their work ethic, and their overall life experiences when selling different products. This include both employees and customers. The challenging part would be the associate to customer ratio. There is always a huge gap in the number of associates available on the floor to assist customers, with the number of customers that walk into the store."
good,Enjoyed working for this company. Started part time and worked my way through the ranks after college. Networking is key in this company. Your hard work will pay off in advancement. Benefits are good and management pay is good.
good,I go into work non stop moving for 8 hours. Lifting and moving product.I learned you need communication to be successful.The mangers try there best to make everyone happy.The hardest part of the job is to please the GM. I enjoy doing the pianos.
good,Fun place to work. Great place to learn workplace skills and someone starting out in the work force. Teaches you lots of skills that you need in life and need in the workforce.
good,"Managing and repair about 40 repair tickets a day, from simple task like installing a antivirus software to troubleshooting hardware problems setting up email, virus removal, repairing damage operating system and recovery deleted files from hard drives. Keeping a good communication with your team is key for success, has well with client giving updates and having a clear idea of there expectation to deliver results and client satisfaction."
good,"Its a good place to work. I've met a lot of great people and everyone likes working there for the most part. "
good,"I worked for Best Buy in Guelph from July 2015 to the end of April 2016. I had an overall very positive experience with the company. I learned how to develop my sales skills and learned to work in a competitive based retail environment. I had excellent people to work with and I have no complaints about my co-workers. My managers were excellent as well and always cared about employees and made sure they had a voice. "
good,I work with some very interesting and different people. I get along with everyone at work and me and some co workers have even became close friends. Everyday at work is a positive experience because I have to constantly solve customers issues with their cameras and other devices.
good,"They teach employees from the ground up and help every step of the way. With Training programs available 24/7, its a drama free, its fun helping customers."
good,"Worked with Geek Squad, The culture of Best Buy is very fun and upbeat. "
good,Great company great culture. pay was decent. love their training. they send you away and they pay for everything which is the best part.
good,"Your day was laid out for you before you got there."
good,One of the better places to work as far as big Corporations go. I loved the culture and environment. Excellent amenities. Excellent benefits. Lots of advancement opportunities.
good,"A great place to work with new challenges every day.  The people are great and we build a strong family and team culture.  Tremendous opportunities to build from, and great coaching and feedback from all levels."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work it makes you want to get up and get right to work. "
good,"great job"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy has been a fantastic place to work. Great discount, fun work environment and friendly co workers. I have worked incredibly hard to make myself valuable to the company, which seems to provide me with unique and amazing opportunities. Unfortunately, I have been promised advancement for some time now and I have yet to see any change. Although considering what is provided to me, its hard to complain. Its an awesome job and stepping stone to bigger and better things, but I have a hard time seeing a career being made."
good,"This is one of my favorite jobs to date, but there is not a lot of room to move beyond super, ultra part-time hours. Outside of that My co-workers are awesome, my management team is supportive and interactive, and the job itself is customer focused and easy to go in and out of every day."
good,"Best buy is a great place to work, mainly because of the environment you are working in. The people who work their are great and easy to get along with and the sales floor offers the ability to increase your customer service as well as communication skills as there are constant opportunities to talk with the general public as well as your cooworkers. Management is great as well, they are friendly, and motivational offering up their knowledge and experience on a daily basis to help their staff succeed in monthly goals as well as other goals the individual may have."
good,"- The job environment can be stressful at times depending on the customers you deal with. some can be very understanding of how our system works some don't care what you have to say and demand service right there and now and expect everything they came in for to be done the same day."
good,"Every day I made sure customers were able to find what they were looking for, and my management respected me for it. At the time, I was unable to get the hours I was looking for simply due to the economy, but it was a good culture with good people and pretty standard pay. I would definitely recommend this job to someone who's looking for developing people skills as well as general tech knowledge (which is becoming more and more valuable each day."
good,"Working at Best Buy is not my ultimate career goal but it is a very great place of employment. As someone interested personally in TV, computer, and gaming technology, I am in good company with an employee base passionate about the type of products sold."
good,"Talking to people helping overcome objhectives, high traffic stress/ tesion between corworkers, but over all a fun work environment to always see new stuff"
good,"Working at Geek Squad requires patience, communication, special attention to detail, and willingness to go above and beyond. The role of a Geek Squad Agent is to fix something that is broken.. This can require calming a client who is upset, communicating with the client the appropriate solution to his or her issue, and the executing that solution to fix and diagnose a broken unit."
good,"Only Looking elsewhere due to Lack of Work Hours"
good,I enjoyed working for best buy and i learned a lot about how to multitask and handle a physical and cerebral work day. I am not skilled in warehouse and sales work.
good,"A day at Best Buy means finding the next person to help. We must engage in meaningful conversation to determine how complete our solutions are and how best to mesh with his or her lifestyle. I have learned a great deal about computers and how to interact with different personalities. I believe our management team has been fair and supportive, making sure staff partakes in constant training and productivity tracking. The hardest part of the job would be keeping up with all of our guests when store traffic is at high volumes, but having a tight-knit, reliable team makes it easier to leverage all of our resources. The most enjoyable part would be assessing what solutions are needed and ushering our guests through their purchases, ensuring their comfort and confidence!"
good,A typical day would be me opening the store & talking to my fellow employees about shrink & loss prevention. The managers would also have a morning meeting & go over our goals. My co-workers were very nice & welcoming everyday. There wasn't really a hard part to my job because I am very good at multi-tasking. The most enjoyable part would be seeing the customers everyday & having them remember me & my great customer service.
good,"Probably my favorite place to work, due to me actively enjoying the tech industry and working in it. The management was great at first, but during the holiday season it obviously got a little worse, but you can't really complain about that. Overall great company, and if given the chance I'd love to work there again, as I was on a Seasonal Contract."
good,"overall was good work experience but management was a little ruff and contradicted each other, it was you average retail positions"
good,"Love interacting with the ,many different customers and employees on a daily basis.  The management is super amazing and very great to get along with."
good,"There is no typical day at BestBuy. You are constantly kept on your toes as you try to meet daily, weekly and monthly goals. Sometimes this is easy, and other times it can be a struggle to get through the day, but that is normal for a retail environment."
good,"A typical day at work will be coming in to look at goals set for the day in terms of revenue needed to hit for the store, checking emails to see what needs to be done, and being able to coach our employees to better themselves as salesmen. I've learned from working at Best Buy, that being able to adapt quickly and efficiently is how you can be a successor in today's workforce. With how technology and society accept changed and adaptation to happen so frequently, an individual must be able to do so as well. The Management team has had it's pros and cons over the years as team members have been replaced. They try to make the work place as enjoyable as possible while striving to be the best we can be. The hardest part about the job was having employees come sell in departments that they were not familiar with,but to solve this solution, I tried to have them cross trained during slow times during the week so they would feel more comfortable to help out during the busy weekends or holiday season. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing customers leave happy and having my coworkers have full confidence in what they are selling to the customers."
good,"A typical day at work is giving out excellent customer service, helping multiple people at one and diagnosing issues and concerns customer have about products. Ive leave a lot from best buy, the most important thing i learned was always show your best face to a customer. Always have a big smile on your face and be as friendly and helpful as you can be. also be VERY knowledgable about the products your selling. Every co-worker I've had at BestBuy has been very friendly and helpful, they will always look out for you the best they can.The hardest part of the job would be maintaining a 100% positive customer satisfaction. Majority of customers are quiet friendly, but they will be a few customers that will come in with a negative attitude and try to take it out on the sales person, which makes it difficult to keep a positive attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relaxed environment. You can always have a regular conversation with a co-worker, as long as there are no customers that need assistance, and hard work is always acknowledged and rewarded."
good,"The job is fun, and I work with a great team! My leaders are great, my hours are flexible and there is plenty of advancement available if you put forth the effort. The only downside is the sales floor is very numbers driven. It's basically like a commission based environment, without the commission. The pay isn't great either, but thats why you'd want to advance. The higher up you go, the better you get compensated for your work. GMs and supervisors are well-paid."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I took customer orders over the phone and did customer pick ups. I also assisted with returns/exchanges. I was the phone operator as well.
good,I did computer work for best buy on the geek squad I learned alot there are lots of products at best buy. I am very impressed by the starting pay it was nice
good,"company was decent enough to work for, management in store was lacking though. Way to much turn around and not enough focus on developing the current employee base they had."
good,"College students, and/or stay at home mom's dream job! Great discounts, fun place to work. Pay is not enough to survive on for a family....."
good,"typical day starts with getting your check in check out sheet to keep track of all sales for the day. Then proceed to contact customers and ask ""What brings you in today""  then engaging in small talk to break down the wall to get to know the customers wants and needs. Then of coarse asking for the sale."
good,"I love working at Best Buy, the environment, benefits, and coworkers are what make it a great place to work. I have worked hard and moved up within the company. Management is helping me get to where I would like to go."
good,"The mobile department lots of fun to work in. Lots to learn but its fast paced work. They pay better than all other retail stores in the York area, especially if you have any retail experience. They have a great mission statement, and for the most part they do a wonderful job sticking to it. Definitely need a good handle on computers and how they work to be successful in this company. They push for numbers but as long as they see consistency or improvement, they are fairly happy."
good,"Not a bad place to work, you get a decent discount on a lot of stuff. Standard customer service/sales gig, there are good days and bad days. Could pay more, but the benefits aren't bad if you're full time."
good,"I am always excited to go to work the atmosphere and my management team is the greatest , they help you and also coach you and there is always room for advancement"
good,"My coworkers are very knowledgeable. I have learned a lot from them and from on the job. A typical day is helping clients solve their IT problems, and working on lots of computers, but I do not like the way Geek Squad is going now. It seems more about making money and less about helping people."
good,Amazing work place and supportive management. It's all about getting stats and results but we still manage to stay strong. We will keep growing as a company and do our best to reach the top. Being number one in the district feels amazing!
good,Fast Paced work environment. A commitment to greatness and i felt it molded me to be better wherever i go in the future.You had to assist customers and provide A class services.
good,"Working at Geek Squad was an amazing opportunity for me to work with an interesting and fun work culture. The idea of always being on your feet and having the ability to tackle hundreds of different personality types and issues always seemed to have me on the edge and begging for more. "
good,Absolutely love working for this company. Tons of opportunity for growth. Management that is committed to a positive employee experience. High expectations ensuring you work alongside motivated people who are committed to doing quality work.
good,"Even though the pay is not the most I have made, this was by far my favorite job.  I truly enjoyed providing the customers with a solution and educating them on products. I never saw myself as a sales person, I was providing a service, giving the customers the knowledge they needed in order to make an informed decision.  Knowing the product and NOT bs'ing your way through keeps customers happy and coming back.  "
good,"I enjoyed my time at Best-Buy - Very worker friendly company . I did many tasks -picking orders , replenishment loading trailers , cleanliness and training new associates, Great people and management"
good,"Its a great place to learn and get familiar with the latest products,for me I have lots of fun with the people I work with, Would recommend to anyone looking to learn how to sell and use specific selling practices."
good,Best Buy is a great place to learn how to improve in the retail business world. Best Buy spends a tremendous amount of money and time to train every employee of every level in order to improve the customer and employee experience.
good,"Excelente lugar para laborar, companeros con una gran disposicion para ayudar, personal administrativo realmete accesible"
good,I enjoy working with the staff and customers. I enjoy helping people learning new tech. I am proud of the staff I have developed and helped promote. Things are always changing in the business.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I loved this job, management was great, and hours were great. I loved helping people decide on which computer they wanted, not to mention helping Geek Squad with diagnostic overflow. The only thing I didn't like was having to sell warranties. These warranties are actually quite good, and I would recommend them, especially if you're accident prone. The discount at the time was also phenomenal."
good,Great place to work.  Lots of advancement opportunities while working with a great team.  People are very friendly.  I enjoy working here; however my commute is taking up too much of my time.
good,"Working at Best Buy is a very rewarding job in many senses. I love working with people, my coworkers are incredible, and the management is outstanding. The company's Renew Blue initiative is really exciting and it can be seen and felt throughout the company as positive changes are constantly being made and employees are always active in creating an environment conducive to having fun while being the best. The environment in my specific store is what keeps me coming back to work each day. I love the people I work with and we treat each other like family. The only downside to my job is the hourly wage that my managers are able to pay me. I earn significantly less than I would at another job with my same duties, yet I do not see this as a fault in my management or specific store but in what the company is able to offer its employees."
good,"growth opportunity"
good,"Working at Best Buy had a fun, eccentric environment to be around. Being able to experiment and explore technology that is constantly evolving. A typical day at work is to customers with their needs, wants and desires so they can have a pleasurable, fun-filled time searching for products they want or just simply browsing around. The co-workers are the best part of working there, they eager you on to do better and they always have your back when its help pitching a sale for a team effort or simply closing down the department for the night. Most enjoyable part of the job is selling when the store is jam packed, gets you pumped and my mind and body just do its own thing, moving without even thinking, adapting to the fast pace environment and the time just flies by so quickly."
good,very friendly learned selling skills talking to people all day showing them the latest and greatest i loved the company it just didnt have a great work and life balance for me
good,"Always a fun environment, with a great team and amazing management. It was a job where you never stopped learning and everyday you meet new and interesting people. I learned many things about electronics, specifically video and audio equipment."
good,I really enjoyed working at best buy. My store had great managers that were supporting and not overly strict. This allowed for a fuun relaxed work place.
good,"Super fun culture and atmosphere. Awesome benefits! Pay is not very competitive in comparison to industry average. They tend to hire from within, but moving up is difficult."
good,"My typical day at work starts out with diagnosis of computers followed by troubleshooting for any obvious issues using proprietary GS software. After that I would normally install, repair, and order computer parts for various name brand laptops, desktops, or audio equipment namely Beats headphones. Before finishing installing and repairs on any devices I would clean and prep the device to be sent to Best Buy stores for re-inspection and document all work. Lunch was normally at 2pm for my PC team. I would occasionally watch people play foosball, a nice plus. Afterwards if the audio department or any of my other agents needed assistance with their parts I would assist them or continue working on my own repairs until the day is over. I was very flexible in which department they needed help in."
good,A typical day starts within Best buy includes jumping right into work which detail in communicating with customers to find the right and best product for that consumer. I learned many ways to deal with customers and my product knowledge increased to a point way selling $2000 Mac-book's came at ease with increased up selling of different products such as Microsoft word or even protection plans. Co-workers would always work together to get the best experience for the customer because we are on a no commission bases. The hardest part was honestly was not being able to close a sale in the beginning but as my experience grew the easier it got to finalize the sale.
good,"A typical day consist of returning, exchanging, placing customer orders, checking out customers, and solving customers order issues and much more. I've learned to communicate and find solutions for my customers. My managers do their best to assist employees and come up with new ways to recognize hard work. My co-workers are very pleasant and we all work as a team to get the job done. The hardest part of my job is getting customers to apply for a Best Buy Credit Card since most customers don't want a credit card. Overall the best part is meeting diverse new people everyday and coming up with solutions that best fits their needs."
good,"I was hired as a seasonal employee. I knew that near the end of my 3 month contract they were going to ask a few of the seasonal employees to become regular a regular employee.  I was one of those asked to stay.  Not only did I work in appliances but I worked in several divisions of the store. I also would help in the cashier area.  When they were busy in cashier area I would volunteer to help check out customers.  "
good,"The typical day consisted of stocking the shelfs, getting the pre orders ready, and talking with management about goals and plans for the day. The hardest part of the day was when there was a influx of customers or an issue came up that took longer than expected, but got resolved. I have learned to interact with customers and how to deal with different types of individuals."
good,"Really productive workplace with onsite dry cleaning, daycare, bank, and 5-star dining."
good,Typical day includes mainly interacting with customers from various backgrounds.This work places helps you manage and improve your customer service skills .
good,"great company to work for, great leadership and opportunities.  awesome headquarters, feels like a family no matter how large they grow.  I would recommend working for Best Buy!"
good,"Best Buy is a unique workplace that can be a breath of fresh air to some. In my department (Merchandising) we are always busy but the environment is laid back compared to other retail stores. This laid back, almost familial feel that Best Buy gives its employees helps them to enjoy work and work even harder than at other jobs."
good,"I worked seasonal at Best Buy. I liked it because there was always something new to learn. I learned different comparisons between laptops and how to activate phones. My coworkers were really cool and really made you feel welcome and appreciated. The management was usually pretty good and fair, except when they would change the schedule on me. The hardest part of the job was selling enough product. I was almost always in the Mobile Department which is the hardest department to sell a lot of product in. The most enjoyable part was setting up new phone accounts and activating phones on current accounts. I really liked seeing my Geek Squad Protection numbers at the end of every week."
good,"working at best buy is a great way to have a great time with minmal stress if your good at sales you make friends pretty quick and they are very patient if you have problems."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Mobile department was pretty great to work in. I didn't like that mobile department was also responsible for the tablet department, especially because I didn't receive proper training in tablets and didn't know too much about them."
good,For the most part Best buy was a solid company to work for. I acquired lots of skills from working here such data entry and the ability to sell items.
good,Good sales job to get your feet wet. Work with you on schedule. Help company give a great customer experience. Good management.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of unloading merchandise from the trucks, checking-in, verifying, and stocking inventory, pricing new items, organizing, constructing, and placing merchandise displays. I was also responsible for special orders, delivery orders, and merchandise returns associated with warehouse inconsistencies. I learned how to check and verify inventory with hand-held scanners, how to prepare large-scale inventory reports for corporate use, how to read, understand, and implement store and corporate policies and procedures, and how to complete tasks in accordance with OSHA guidelines.The management team members were competent and always willing to work along side their employees. The hardest part of this job was learning the most effective and efficient way to load the trucks that were making multiple deliveries to homes and to the warehouses. The most enjoyable part of this job was the opportunity to continue learning new things and the increased responsibilities that went along with it."
good,A typical day at work i would have to get customers to apply for a best buy credit card. I would have to stop major returns to the best of my ability. My co-workers are fun and supportive whenever help is needed.
good,"Best Buy is a great company to work for especially for a first job. They have good benefits and great people to work with. I have worked at two different best buy's in two different cities, and both have been really good to me. I would recommend Best Buy to anyone!"
good,My days start and end with troubleshooting technological issues of all devices that Best Buy sells. My team is great and we always have fun while being the best. The hardest part of my job is always being singled covered during the week and still meeting the needs of every customer and the business needs. The most enjoyable part about my job is having clients count on me to resolve there issues in a timely and professional manner.
good,I thought I would be at Best Buy temporarily. I am still here 5 and a half years later and still enjoy working here. I love my managers and fellow employees. I also love that the staff is not paid on commission so what we recommend is truly what we like and not based on vendor/Best Buy kickback.
good,Fun culture that has recently moved toward a more number focused work environment that can sometimes be difficult to work with other employees.  Employees become so number driven that they forget critical business functions such as cleaning and stocking.
good,"I come in at seven in the morning, I do my stock counting and make sure everything is counted accurately. When done, I process them in our Retek Sale System so we know our inventory is correct. If we are over or short, then I will do research and then team up with our management to figure out where our product is or why we have so much of this product. My coworkers and I work as a team together. I feel like I can count on them to get our daily tasks done. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing we get the job done at the end of the day and I know I will make a customer happy when they know they found we have what they want at our store and they come in to buy it and leave with a satisfied attitude."
good,Working for Geek squad has enabled me to provide customers with a world class experience and services. Ive gained knowledge on the ability to use and troubleshoot new technology and also gained leadership skills. My management team and co workers work excellent as a team and are more than willing to help each other. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people from all over the world.
good,My job as a bilingual sales associate consisted of translating for customers very often. With that I mainly juggled quite a few customers at one time. I worked in the computer department but also specialized in the tv and entertainment department. My job was to help customers find what they were looking for and if they weren't exactly sure of what it was they were in there for than I asked probing questions to come up with a perfect solution and product for them.
good,"Amazing environment filled with enthusiastic managers who are always there to assist and guide you. Adequate training provided to elevate confidence and help you excel in your department. Personally, I learned more about computer hardware and software and enjoyed exceeding managers expectations by selling nearly $750/hour. The coworkers are friendly and are always there to assist you."
good,Co-workers are great and easy to get along with. Good team atmosphere. Managers are professional and personable. I've received some real world experience in the technology field.
good,"Best Buy has given me many opportunities and has allowed me to grow as a professional. Every retail job will have it's faults, but I always focus on the positives."
good,"This is a fun place to work at, i love the people i work with, i plan to continue to advance my knowledge in technology and it was thanks to this company that i have started my career in technology."
good,Amazing company to work for as a student or even wanted to move up in! There are a lot of different opportunities working at best buy and I would say best buy teaches you have to really become a sales men!
good,"It's a really great company, but for long term I wouldn't recommend it. It's an average pay retail job with hardly any incentive to doing good. You can work hard or not at all and get paid as much as the next guy."
good,All good. Employees make experience even more enjoyable and fun. Each day is a new experience. Good place to work. I would recommend working for this company
good,The best part of this job are the challenges which you face on daily basis; interacting with the customers and satisfying their needs. But at the same time its fun as the working environment is very lively with no undue restrictions. Also the management of my store is extremely supportive in every aspect.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Great group of coworkers, great tools to get work done and a system that is east to follow and work with."
good,"I really liked my job at Best Buy. It was a fun place to work and we had a great culture at our store. Our management was less than stellar however, and I ended up moving to another employer. This is the job where I discovered my passion for merchandising and transition management. I also learned many different skills on this job and they enabled me to pursue doing what I loved."
good,"best buy is an amazing place to work, meeting new people everyday, learning about new tech was really a blessing."
good,Great place to be for the most part a typical work day depends on the MOS that you have.  Fellow Marines become lifelong friends hardest part of the job is deployment. Most enjoyable part is the people you work with.
good,"In a warehouse setting, I lead a group of part-time and full-time employees. I make sure all the products are properly shipped, received, and processed (according to store and manufacture warranty policies). I fix and resolve any inventory issues and also deal with customer issues dealing with faulty products and/or other issues relating to installs or other services offered by Best Buy. I also have experience on the sales floor selling to customers (both private and businesses). I also have experience in running the  Asset Protection department that dealt with internal and external theft/damages/loss of property. Through Best Buy, I have completed 125+ trainings, many of which directly correspond to the job I am applying for. I can send a list of these trainings if requested. Some include: Supervisor Leadership P2E, Shipping/Receiving 101, Heat and Illness Prevention, Electronic Bill of Landing 101 2014, Physical Inventory Scanning/Auditing, and Electrical Safety FY14."
good,"Avoid job if you are not driven to advance, as it can be very repetitive if you are not constantly learning. If you are genuinely trying to move forward and learn more, there is a good opportunity for advancement between stores and positions."
good,"on an average day i speak to over 40 customers learning there problems and developing solutions that will benefit the company and the customer weather its showing them a computer for school or making an appointment for geek squad to come to there house to fix there router and printer i learn something new about computers due to the new ones we get in. the management is very comical and serious at the same time, they make sure that work is done while setting up games geared towards performance which boost moral."
good,Great Mgmt. Excellent team members fun place to work. Learned alot the company education program. Great bonuses.
good,my typical day at work is selling the latest and greatest product best buy has to offer. Learning a lot of different languages each and every day cause we deal wit a lot of international customers. Management is very big on our ''no customers go unserved '' policy. my co-workers are very enjoyable to be around. The hardest part of my job is probably trying to understand what the customers is saying. the most enjoyable part of my job is seeing and knowing that i did a good job with helping the customer especially when k see a smile on their face.
good,Work place used to a fun and enjoyable but as managers started to get replaced by restructuring in the company become more strict and wasn't as enjoyable on a daily basis.
good,"great working experience! fast pace, and learning experience."
good,Good place to work. I worked here for two years so far. Best Buy has always been good to me. No complaints about the job. I love all of my co-workers we get along great. The pay could be better but that's the only bad thing I can say about the company.
good,I would sit at a desk by the customer service counter and answer the phone my entire shift. I'd make sales over the phone and the customers would come pick it up at the store. When the phone wasn't ringing then I would walk around the store and help the customers shopping. I always liked learning about the new products that were coming out and testing them out. The management was great.
good,"What i learned in my previous employment positions was communicating with customers, one on one or in groups. Educating ourselves on the products that we sell, as well as educating customers on the products. I found that the people i worked with were great to get along with, everyone was very welcoming. "
good,"While working as Loss Prevention , you were involved in every department and got to know the different aspects of the whole store and its Operations. From Sales to Warehouse you had to work with everyone to achieve one common goal of having a successful tore with outstanding Customer Service. At times, the Vision of some of the managers would not be realistic when it came to performance of the store because of low staffing at times. A lot of room for advancement withing the company. A lot of different positions all over the country were available."
good,"Ive had a good experience at Best Buy, fun atmosphere, production oriented, work with outgoing, like-minded people"
good,"You can get all sorts of awesome stuff working at Best Buy. My friend won a pair of Beats, went to training in Dallas, gets cheap phone plans and free spyware for our computer thanks to Best Buy. Not to mention the tuition reimbursement. But one thing I have an issue with is that they will pay you less than everybody else if you have a disability. But since you are not allowed to talk about your salary, you can't bring up the discrimination to anyone. And no matter how long you've worked there, they'll get rid of you in a second if you don't have great numbers and someone is willing to do your job for a cheaper price. Definitely go for a job in Computers or Mobile. Lots of perks!"
good,"- Typical day at work would involve solving technical troubles with a variety of devices with a different and varied customer base."
good,Since the first day I moved to Best Buy it has been amazing.  Everyone there loves there job and the culture there is amazing. i have never been at a job where everyone really cares about the culture.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Muy buen ambiente de trabajo, los gerentes son muy accesibles, saben idear planes estratégicos ante cualquier situación, el personal de trabajo es muy unido gracias a las diferentes dinámicas que se realizar durante el periodo de trabajo."
good,"A typical day would consist of providing customers with help, making sure there was enough products on the showrooms/displays, using cash registers and offer every customer a credit card. "
good,"A typical day at work would include drilling all aspects of my stores performance, wins and opportunities. Would partner with my assistant managers and leaders and validate that they are executing their goals and commitments. Focus was always creating an amazing employee and customer experience which contributed to a favorable P&L"
good,Working at Best Buy was an experience in itself. When i started working for Best Buy i was but 17 years of age. I was limited to the amount of hours i could produce and i was also limited to the tasks that i was given. I enjoyed the work experience and the hardest part was just bearing with the fact that i was the youngest person on the job.
good,"Daily reports to send out, data to collect and send out to managers. I learned a lot about Excel especially when using it daily.  Having a staff and store managers to help daily makes no two days the same. There are always deadlines and changes to meet, which were all met 100% of the time. Meetings set up and carried out with no issues. I had some great co workers. Always there is I needed them.  I was there to cover and help them also.  Every once in a while it got a little rough with the last minute changing of plans, itineraries, but it all comes together in the end.  I enjoy helping people, assisting where needed, being behind the scene putting things together. There are also the customers that call that I helped and were very appreciative that I was there to assist them."
good,Loved working together as a team. Enjoyed the challenge of learning new products and training to expand my knowledge all while helping customers find exactly what they came there for.
good,"Positive persona, happy people, Great co-workers, organized, great training and leadership"
good,"I was responsible for the scheduling, payroll, sales in the store, and running the operations of the store without issue."
good,Great place to start and end your career. The ability to move through the ranks is endless and if you focus and buckle down you can make great money while working for an amazing company.
good,Best Buy is a really fun company to work for. Hard work is rewarded. Customers expect the best.
good,Best Buy has been a great company. I have been there for almost 4 years now and I have learned so much through my colleagues and management. We are connected to the mall so we were pretty busy at times and the holidays were no joke. Overall there was never really any hard part of the job besides retaining so much information you are given on a daily basis. I had great co workers whom which have become some of my closest friends and there are all great sales associates. I am only looking for a higher step in my career and pursuing other opportunities. I will take everything that I have learned through best buy and implement it in my career.
good,Best Buy is a great place to learn how to build your leadership skills and take it to the next level. BestBuy has by far one of the best training programs I have ever seen. My focus was to ensure my sales team took the necessary online trainings which I would follow up with a role-play to ensure each team member understood the new product or service Best Buy offered. The hardest part of the job was Geek Squad services which we provide in-home services which required extensive job codes which we would sell consultations to impact the customers dream system and have our sales team enter the home to create a full solution for the customer. The best part of my job every day was coaching and developing young people every day around selling skills techniques I’ve learn the past 15 years of my career.
good,Great company to work for i have accomplished a great amount of success within the year being there. Warehouse and logistics process performed on a daily.
good,"Best Buy was a great place to work. I would have gladly worked their full or part-time, but I was let go once the holidays were over because my employment was only seasonal. The management at Best Buy was wonderful. All the managers are very knowledgeable and helpful. The co-workers in my department were very easy to work with. They showed me the ropes when I got there and never seemed annoyed to answer my questions. The people you work with here are like a close family. Everyone is fun and helpful. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to talk about video games to the customers and be able to help them find the product that best suited them."
good,Best Buy is a great place to stay on top of the latest devices that make life more enjoyable. This job fosters the ability to develop employees to be able to do their best daily in identifying and fulfilling the needs of our customers.
good,Best Buy taught me how to sell appliances and a career I love.  Fun work environment.
good,This place is great as far as people you work with and even management is not to bad. Some of the problems with it would be that you really don't move up in the company and getting a raise or extra hours is almost impossible.
good,I have learned more in Management training at Best Buy than anywhere else. Every where from business acumen to logistics and overall coaching a sales team in being top performers throughout the company
good,I truly found my strengths working at Best Buy. I was given an opportunity to grow in my field and discover what I can bring to any organization in communications.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I learned how to sale and to close a sale and get better at sales the hardest part of the job was selling computers.
good,Great work environment.Great coworkers.Hardest part of the job would be actually learning how to set up sellular phones with plans. With some practice it becomes very easy.
good,"Everyday we must reach a set quota for repaired computers and diagnosed computers. I've learned quite a lot about multiple PC brands, and their common issues; from HP,Acer, Asus, Dell and Apple. Management seems to just layout the monthly plans of what the company expects from us this month, but sometimes the communication is poor. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the demanded turn time for every unit. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to manage your own break time throughout the day."
good,I enjoy working for this company the time that I have.  The only thing I have not liked that much about the company is the level of envancement.
good,"I really enjoyed working with Best Buy, I was a Computer Sales Consultant. The job is very easy if you know your stuff."
good,"A typical day of work at Best Buy involves a lot of great  interactions with customers.  As a consultant, I'm always teaching something new to customers and also learning things as well.  Overall, Best Buy is a great place to work due to customers, friendly co-workers, and the management."
good,I really can't say anything to bad about this company. They have taken good care of me over the years. If and when you find the right store with the right people in it. It is the best place to work. Compensation can better that's all I can really say.
good,"Inventoried, set merchandise and daily price changes. How to set up a store, pricing system, and working with customers on a daily basis. Management worked with employees and very concerned that the employees were content.  Great atmosphere amongst co-workers.  Hardest part of the job was disagreeable and irrational customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping open a new store."
good,"I am expected to: "
good,Best buy is pretty laid back if you've ever done retail. Black friday wasn't even too shabby. :)
good,great place if you love tech and gadgets. co workers are friendly and fun. hours are good and great if your not a morning person lol
good,"Most get hired in by a company never hire you full time"
good,"i loved to work here, it was a good environment and the people were fun to work with. only thing was that hours can be low when you need them the most."
good,"I worked with many good people with good sportsmanship and laid back. I learned how to use the software soft thinks to refurb computers, laptops, and tvs. The hardest part about the job was figuring out what brand of computer used what settings."
good,"Anyone who applies for this company and gets the job, be prepared to be constantly tested on your computer and electronic knowledge. The first thing you do as an employee is take many e-learnings, or online lessons to test your knowledge on everything in your designated department. After that, you are the one that people rely on for the best knowledge about what they are about to buy. Good luck!"
good,"The culture of GSC is unlike anywhere that I have ever worked.  I enjoy coming in everyday to my work family of 1,200 people and being able to laugh and enjoy our time while working.  The company values are learn from challange and change, unleash the power of the people, show respect , humility and intergrity and have fun while being the best."
good,"When working in the store the employees feel like family. You come in everyday and fight in the trenches together. It is a very numbers driven environment. I come in everyday with a smile eager to help customers. I started in computers, went to geek squad, then to appliances and now Magnolia which is premium home theater. The company really encourages growth and opportunity for advancement. One of the few companies you can go far in with out a degree which makes the competition hard. The company mainly promotes from within, so everyone starts on the ground floor. There are daily, weekly and monthly goals set my managers and you are held accountable on a weekly basis for your performance. Either your tracked on margin or revenue and your attach rate of different columns. Managers don't want you to be pushy and just thoroughly explain the benefits about certain accessories so the customer can see more of a reason to buy extra thing, where as the supervisors get in trouble if you don;t meet your criteria and could care less how you do it. It's a fun place to work and you meet a lot of interesting customers. It's amazing coming to work thinking how much 1 transaction will change your customers life style for the next 4 years at least."
good,"Assist customers with questions on new products, find the right product for the customer. Handle register transactions as well as pre-orders. I enjoyed the amount of knowledge I learned in the short period of time I was employed there."
good,"A typical day at best buy is to interact with clients, make them feel welcomed. Look at overall business as a supervisor to run it effectively. Also I have to motivate my team and help them develop skills to execute. The best part of my day is helping my teams to succeed. The toughest part of my job if I was unable to help a client."
good,Lots of fun and a great work environment. Co workers were the best as well as the benefits.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I've learned a lot from many people in my 10 years with Best Buy.  Every day was a new challenge.
good,"There are three different shifts open, mid, and close. You will help costumers find a new computer or tablet. You will also help find cables and printers. You will offer services to the costumer to help their products work. The hardest part of the job is understanding what when wrong for the costumer product, so you can get them in something that won’t do that."
good,"Learned new technologies."
good,"In Geek Squad you must posses self motivation. My day begins by ensuring all shipping, receiving, report managed and finishing touches on all almost completed computers are finished before store opens. Throughout the day I contact all clients via telephone and keep them up to date on their repair status, work on computer repairs, assist in checking in computers and client issues. I believe working for the Geek Squad has enhanced my multitasking and trouble shooting abilities. "
good,Best Buy is a great place to work.  There are a lot of opportunities for advancement if you are looking to move into management.  There are flexible hours and good benefits for all employees.
good,A Best Buy the main goal was to have the customer leave the store happy and with the complete solution.  We made sure we built rapport with the customers by displaying great customer service.  Management was great and they made training and working for best buy fun.  The co workers were all friendly and team players.  The hardest part about the job was trying to have total product knowledge.  The most enjoyable part to working for best buy was building relationships with the customers.
good,"I personally loved it, the training, the people, all of it. It was great until I had to transfer because my current ride wasn't working out so well and no one seemed to want to car-pool. So I put in for a transfer, went through all the loops and in the end...nada."
good,Chill and easy job. I've outgrown most retail jobs. But I really enjoyed working at best buy during my short time there.
good,"During High School, I was fortunate to work here as a Computer Technician. I repaired computers as well as helped customers find what they needed. I was giving special access to management computers so that I can perform management duties including refunds and credit card related duties."
good,Come into work and check inventory and open up store. what i learned was working with a team and inventory. management worked very well with employers and customers. Co-workers was helpful when needed and worked hard. Hardest part was restocking of items once store close. the most enjoyable part was the benefits of best buy.
good,cool first time job that provides hadns on experience and in depth training on customer serivice and electronics.
good,The management is very positive and very uplifting. If you need to talk to someone they will almost instantly make time for you. They want to make sure you are having the best work experience.
good,"BestBuy is a relaxed work environment, and a fun place to work, management is not too harsh on employees and they just want you to succeed at the job at hand. Co-workers are friendly and fun to work with."
good,Great people to work for. Awesome items to choice from anything from cds to blue ray dvd players. hdtv etc.
good,I learned teamwork and getting recognize when you do something good for your department and the company.
good,"At Bestbuy, a typical day, can be anything from processing orders over the phones, for customers. To diffusing angry customers over the phone or in person. I said, that this job is ever changing, because working in a technology store, technology is ever changing. It's challenging, in the best way, because your always having to learn about the newest, latest, and greatest technology. And I love that. My co-workers are the best thing about Bestbuy. We are a unified team. We hold each other accountable, and teach other different tasks every day. The most difficult thing about my job, is our systems. Our systems can be slow, and take time to do simple returns. In which, customers become frustrated. Over all, I have enjoyed my time at Bestbuy immensely.  "
good,"A typical day would consist of me getting to work and rushing to get the things done that the person on the night shift forgot. I would get everything up and ready before the store would open. Some days the registers were slow, if this happened I would clean up the work area. It was never done. I organized the front lanes to be a well organized and full department. When customer came to the registers I would give A+ service making each customer smile and get to know everyone of them. I would also train or explain other employees on how to use the register and different selling skills. Sometimes I would work as an MCSA, Multi-Channel Sales Associate, and answer the phones. I can usually sell anything over the phone. "
good,"I took the responsibility of identifying new process, finding out gaps in existing process, arranging  training for new process development and implementation.."
good,A typical day at work for me is doing safety inspections as well as audits and watching the CCTV cameras for theft. I learned how to be a better employee as well as a leader of others. The hardest part of the job is when something goes wrong and everyone looks at you to fix it. The most enjoyable part of the job is the extracurricular things we participate in as a company. 
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Coaching and development of sales staff."
good,"Great people, amazing culture and focus on work/life balance."
good,I loved working there until they changed the way they run their business. They pretty much want you to pressure the customer into buying. They think everyone that comes in to Best Buy is going to buy. 
good,I do returns and exchanges at work. I also check people in for services or offer services to those who ask. You are challenged every day that you work. I do come across unpleasant customers who are not satisfied by any reasons and I have to find solutions to ensure the customer leaves the store happy. I work with great people who are supportive and very outgoing to be around. I repair minor technology issues that can be repaired in store. I learn more things about technology every day that I work.
good,"The atmosphere here is great. Best Buy treats their employees and customers with respect, fairness and a fun attitude. They recognize good work, and they are tactful and good with correcting errors.  The only downside I saw here was that during certain time periods, they do not have the floor traffic to continuously have all their employees on schedule with the proper amount of hours. And, an hour lunch break instead of a 30-minute lunch break would be nice, although not necessary."
good,"A typical day involves opening the store and making sure everything is ready for the new day. Making sure the communication binder is up-to-date and goals are assigned to all staff on shift. Typically, you stand at the front of the store and get people to come in. Once customers are in the store it's your job to make sure they find the right phone and plan for their needs. You achieve this by asking qualifying lifestyle questions and actively listening to, and summarizing for them what they want. Then you find the appropriate plan, phone, and term for the customer so they leave happy. The happier they are the more they will buy from you. Accessories, extended service plans are easy to add-on with the right rapport."
good,You may never get rich working at best buy but as far as retailers go the are a great place to work.  They keep you up to date on all the latest technology to keep their employees informed on what they are selling. 
good,"Meet customer needs"
good,The company attempts to extend the same atmosphere in its stores as it does in the corporate enviornment.
good,"I really enjoyed working here even though my shifts were small; I felt that I was really welcomed in the company and 'part of the family' of Blue. I learned a lot about different electronics and was trained in different parts of the store - they were great about getting an employee to know more than just one area. The hardest part about the job would have to be constantly moving, but that was more of a physical hardship than anything. Once I was there long enough, however, I got over that. The best part would be the advancement and the recognition. Yearly raises weren't heard of at my other jobs so it was nice to be reviewed and get a raise for my hardwork."
good,Fun job. Great work environment. alot of room to advance into higher positions
good,Good pay helping customers with technology needs fixing computers assisting customers in finding the products they need.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Best Buy, and I'd gladly work there again."
good,The company becomes part of your family. I enjoy everyone I work with. Some employees that I work with will work a little harder then the others but besides that I everyone works hard. The company has taught be how to be a good inventory associate.
good,"Great company, have to work smart instead of harder. No customer goes unserved; no employee goes untrained."
good,"It was better than my old Jobs. The Managers were flexible, the hours were okay. The amount of work for your pay is a bit low, but work is work. Overall a decent company."
good,Its a great place to work at for someone looking for their first job. You would receive a so many different experience and knowledge. The company focus is always been towards educating their employees. The hardest part about the job is dealing with different types of customers but an employee with patients could adjusts.
good,"A shift at Best Buy as a customer service associate is quite entertaining. Mostly i would stand behind the counter and customers would approach me for making returns or just general inquiries about products. The sales staff at Best Buy did an excellent job in assisting customer usually before they would even get to me. This would free me up to do more admin tasks such as filing paperwork processing bank deposits and making sure the counters looked clean, organized and presentable. Management did a great job at making sure we had the supplies and tools we needed to perform our tasks. They usually were able to fill up orders immediately for supplies the store needed. Management also did a fantastic job at keeping all the employees up to date on any events or situations that would arise. The hardest part about working at Best Buy was getting to work from my house. Honestly there is hard about working at Best Buy because there was nothing they did everything to make working there easy on top of being very flexible with there hours and accommodating full-time students. This coupled with the most enjoying part of my job which was talking to customers and solving there problems, filling there needs was one of the most satisfying things about working at Best Buy."
good,Best Buy in Westwood was a great place to have fun while doing your work. Talking with other co-workers was not a big issue as long as the department was clean and all nearby customers were acknowledged. I've learned to organize the warehouse and how to problem solve issues when my Supervisor was off.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,BestBuy is great company to work for with a few exceptions. Its really hard to advance at the store level and in corporate. All stores aren't on the same page which can create a frustrating experience for the customer. Other than that the discount is nice and what you learn is awesome.
good,A typical day at Best Buy was a fun and new experience with the co-workers or the managers. I learned many new types of technology at Best Buy. Almost everyday was fun and exciting to go to since everyone was so friendly. I say mostly because there are days that do bring you done for awhile. The hardest part of the job for me was trying to stop thefts from happening since I couldn't always see what was happening but knew that there were people trying to steal thanks to the head sets we wore at Best Buy. The most enjoyable part of Best Buy had to be talking and helping customers since there was a high range of customers that would come in.
good,"Obviously a few bad apples, as with any job, but overall I really enjoyed my time with the company. Challenging work that varies every day. Some issues with district level management - but easily overcome by good store management. Lots of movement and turnover, but it's difficult to break into management without prior experience."
good,"Supervisor of 10 employees, staffing, pay roll, Heavy lifting, fast paced professional atmosphere, at the cutting edge of the forever evolving electronic marketplace, sales and delivery."
good,"i ABSOLUTELY loved working for Best Buy! The management was amazing. They are very relate-able and great to their employees. The co workers are great as well. Of course you have some grumpy co workers but there are so many other amazing ones you just brush them off. Training is easy, takes about 2 or 3 days. Nothing bad to say about this place. Loved it !"
good,"Of all the companies I've worked for, Best Buy was probably my favorite. Having worked there twice (once right out of High School and another time between school transfers), it was an atmosphere where I truly felt appreciated as an employee. Given the adequate pay-rate and their attention to not only the customers' needs but also those of their employees, I was thankful to have been a part of the company for as long as I was. My typical day at work consisted primarily of customer service and sales within their Media department. Being placed primarily in their gaming department, I often enjoyed talking with parents and their children about the educational opportunities that often lie hidden within much of the video games played today. Though the hardest part for me was working in less-than familiar territory within Best Buy's Media Department ( i.e. selling pop music and rap albums), my co-workers and managers were quick to help me solve any problems that might arise and even quicker to help when needed."
good,"It was always great knowing that you have a fun team standing behind you and encouraging you to better yourself in your field. Management at Best Buy was great and always wanted to make sure you were where you wanted to be, as far as careers go."
good,Best Buy is an excellent place to work to take your mind off the roiling academics that make up the college environment. A typical day in this position involved the straightforward task of identifying desires and expectations and attempting to meet the same. It also involved the less clear cut managing of customer expectations as most customers were not willing to pay the full price for what they wanted.
good,"On my work days I am constantly busy with customer service, counting money, using our hiring system, UNICRU, conducting new employee training, fixing problems that occur with customer orders, and supervising a group of about 15 people to create high morale at work and push them to reach their personal goals and the goals of the company. I've learned discipline, patience, and really who I am. The management team here along with our fantastic group of employees have really molded me into the person I am today. They are the reason I come to work everyday and push myself to keep moving forward. The hardest part about the job is probably the holiday time. We get really busy during November-January but it is rewarding in the end once we've put in all of our hard work. The best part about the job is the really great customer interactions that take place, and the people that I supervise. Without their hard work I would not be in the place that I am now."
good,"I had a great experience at Best Buy. Luckily, I was surrounded by great people, who had the right attitude to make a successful store. Management in your location is key here, as I know other locations which were not as well run."
good,"Working at Best Buy is fun and a great job, however, when compared with companies that are similar in size and type, Best Buy is slow to give raises and management is very skewed at some levels. While everyone has a common goal and good intentions, sometimes they go about carrying out their plans in the wrong way. The fellow employees at the Best Buy I work at are wonderful, there have been very few that I don't like. This company has great taste in people and what they look for, even if they can't quite keep them happy."
good,Great sales customer service experience.
good,Unload trucks and replenish shelves. Co- workers were very helpful
good,great management team easy going no stress fun place to work
good,I have had a very good experience so far working in sales at Best Buy. All of my coworkers and management work together as a team. What I like the most is that I am consistently learning about all types of technology as new products are released. Working here has yielded an impressive amount of technical knowledge. The most difficult part of the job would have to be keeping up with very fast paced days around the holiday season.
good,"This was a fantastic place to work while I was in college. They have relatively flexible hours, easy to follow rules and regulations, and they reimburse some/most of your tuition. Most customers are cool but some can be a drag."
good,I would say this was a good employer it was so long ago I worked there I have no comment though.
good,"I loved everything about working at Best Buy. My managers were great and very helpful on anything I wasn't too clear about. It was my second time being employed as a cashier, but my training was easy going and simple. I enjoyed interacting with the customers on the floor of the store and at the front lanes. My co-workers were fun to work with--the time went by fast working with them. The hardest part of the job was sometimes the scheduling, but the most enjoyable part was talking to and helping different people everyday."
good,Know the scope of work and do the job. Have great communication skills with customers in their homes. Be humble and show humility and be 100% respectful to customers and your peers. The hardest part of the job is when I see a customer have a breakdown with computers or technology because it is too much techno mumbo jumbo for them so I simplify it for them as much as possible and then the results are the most enjoyable part of the job which is a BIG smile on their face before I leave and they just give me a lot of praise.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Once you clock on for a shift you are constantly moving. I've learned with this position how to multitask efficiently without compromising the customer experience. The management team is great, I only wish we could have more of them on the floor at a time. The hardest part of the job is trying to please everyone, however there is always a solution to be found. The most enjoyable part of the job is my coworkers. The employees at Best Buy are like a huge family, anyone will help you if they can."
good,"Working at best buy has been a great experience I enjoy working with the people I work with , the employees are great and the mangers are also we all joke around and get along very well we know when its time work and when theres time to have fun.I also enjoy helping customers,but at customer service you also get angry customers but you learn to deal with it as you gain more experience dealing with all type of situations. The hardest part of my job is not be able to find a solution for a customer because we want to help everyone.Working at customer service we mainly do returns exchanges and deal with customer issues that's what we do only a daily basis."
good,I always had fun working at best buy everyday I loved to come to work. The employee's are nice and most of the customers. the hardest part is when new games and systems come out. Other then that everyday was a learning experience
good,Best Buy is only what you make of it! Just have to learn through challenges and change.
good,"As a recent graduate of the University at Buffalo, I understand that finding a solid career is nearly impossible at this point in time. Therefore, on my search for that career, I chose to work part time at Best Buy in Home Theatre sales."
good,Working for this company was truly a fun and update experience when it came to clocking in to actually being trained to sell a product and being a certified seller for that exact product. Co workers were very friendly and easily related to you in part of your department.
good,"An average day at best buy included a high level of phone technology knowledge and friendly customer service. Best Buy taught me to have patience with every type of individual while being able to teach customers things they never knew about the new age of telephone technology. Being able to create a relationship with a customer while selling to them was the balance we had to maintain. My co-workers at this job soon became a second family, and we were able to work in a synchronized helpful way. I learned more information that I could take away and share with everyone than I had ever learned in my life. It was amazing to know what one little piece of technology could do and how it could change peoples lives. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people everyday and introducing them to a different way of living through technology, being able to ""wow"" someone by using the knowledge I gained working with individuals who were highly trained in phone technology gave me a great sense of self satisfaction."
good,"I enjoy working at Best Buy, I work hard because I care and because I am motivated, I love the people I work with, they are fun and it makes it a fun place to work."
good,"Come in do your shift and go home. The store manager is amazing but the ones beneath him are evil and wicked. Some of the co-workers were laid back. I had a few that would get under my skin. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a certain red head that would fall under the wicked category! Overall, the store brought in a lot of athletes, it was upbeat, with fun extras for the employees."
good,"Like any retail job your day to day is based mostly on customer traffic. On high traffic days work flows smoothly and almost seemlessly, however on slower days time is often filled with department cleaning and a brief over view of training."
good,"Best Buy is all about team work. We work hard, joke hard and at the end of the day the job gets done."
good,great training for different department. Managers are well knowledge in their specific departments.
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work. Part timers don't get paid so great and have no benefits, but full timers have great benefits like 401k, company stock, health, etc. Customers are constantly coming in and out of the store with peak hours. It's a fast paced environment and you meet a lot of great people. They have an extensive training program so every 2-4 weeks you are continuing to learn more. They treat their employees great, pizza, cook-outs, ice cream, and even bonuses for meeting revenue goals. They do a lot for the community and each store kind of becomes a family. The employee retention rate is extremely high."
good,"This company sets policies that allow growth within the company. Unfortunately, the hour requirements do not work around school schedules for full time employees."
good,"Very compressive when doing schedules, employee oriented company, I learn a lot during the last 4 years, thanks to them now i am more confident when doing sales and making sure the customer goes with all they need. Management was good, the hardest part of the job was inventory times. The most enjoyable part of my job was to work with my coworkers and be able to be myself in what im good at."
good,"I have worked at Best Buy for almost 9 years. This is a great company to work for, and I can tell you that Best Buy truly cares about the employee and customer experience. The values Best Buy has are great, and they encourage employees to live the values. I learned everything about business results, business acumen, labor analysis, store operating model, revenue forecasts and results, people skills, customer service skills, management, leadership, inspiring a team, teamwork, training and encouraging others, development, and what hard work and work ethic really means. Being around the latest and greatest in technology is always a fun way to start your day. New releases of new gadgets were a are a very exciting part of the job. The hardest part of my job in management at Best Buy, is the long hours I work, and working every weekend and on holidays. In retail, you work when the business needs you, which requires that employees are there during those times. I have met people through networking and co-workers that will remain in my life forever as friends. I have much to be thankful for with Best Buy."
good,Great store to work for. Managers are fun and the employees are always willing to help.
good,"This is the best job I've ever had. Beteween the great work environment and the constant training and development by Management, it was a pleasure to work there and I have and would further recommend anyone to take advantage of any chance to be part of that team, despite what some say about the company in the media."
good,worked with customers and provided information about products
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.

good,Best Buy was a great work environment that allowed you to have fun and work hard. If you enjoy selling in a team driven environment then Best Buy is going to be a good company for you.
good,Best Buy gave me the opportunity to grow within the company and always gave me options to try new things. If you work diligently and do your job you’ll find it isn’t hard. It did take me a long time to advance just because of the constantly changing job structures.
good,it's a great place to learn and grow. you will become knowledgeable and have expertise for life. paid holidays and room for growth. you have to push credit cards but if you can sale you can excel
good,"Overall was a great place, learned alot of management skills and great work environment. Great opportunity for growth and development. Working with the latest technology was fun."
good,"Best Buy provides a good opportunity to gain sales and customer service experience. I learned a great deal about retail and the products sold by Best Buy in my time working there. Management will of course vary from store to store, but I had a good experience with management. There is an expectation to hit sales goals and this is still a retail position at the end of the day, but it is an enjoyable retail experience."
good,Full of energy and fast paced. Always enough staff and everyone is working in areas where their strongest suits can be practiced. Sometimes too over the top.
good,En general buena empresa aunque podrían mejorar algunos aspectos respecto a los conocimientos de los supervisores en todas las áreas y no solo en su área de especialización
good,It was good to work for and worked with schedules well. I just need something that pays better and offers vacation. Once the new owners took over they almost are trying push the full timers out to bring in all part time.
good,Best Buy was a great workplace with an even better culture and benefits. The atmosphere was comfortable and selling products felt rewarding. The managers and staff were all great.
good,Take care of employees and involves itself into the community. The growth is there if you're willing to work for it and put in the time it take to learn.
good,"Fantastic place to work. Daily work is fun and pays well. Hours are on the lower-end as a part time employee. Definitely worth it during the holiday season,"
good,"Tienen una buena cultura laboral, disfrute mucho mi trabajo en Best Buy"
good,"Working at Bestbuy taught me so much, from being more open to being knowledgeable about products. My social skills gotten better due to being a shy person, but Best Buy opens its doors to individuals making everyone  feel welcome and appreciated and I loved that the most."
good,"Typical day: Really competitive during the slow periods but really exciting and thrilling during the holidays and busy periods."
good,"I enjoy this job. I work well at reception. My managers are extremely nice and genuinely care about the employees. Holidays are slowing down, so my hours have been a little off. Other than that, I would love to continue working there."
good,Good management trickles down the satisfaction of the employees. The team that manages the store I worked for do a great job in emphasizing the importance of working together to achieve a common goal all while improving employees as individuals.
good,"Enjoyed the people and the diversity. Had a good cafeteria and game room for breaks."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy was a great company to work for, they had a great culture and I got to learn a lot. The e-learning and trainings are great and through that I got my main interest to focus on networking as I fell in love with the new technology around connected devices."
good,"Once you get the hang of working at best buy, it quickly becomes easy and fun. everyone there is extremely considerate and will help you gain the knowledge needed to succeed with this company"
good,"I've held my position at BestBuy longer than any other job and there's a real reason for that. My coworkers here are like a family and they offer plenty of benefits, even for part timers, I just wish the part time benefits were a bit more substantial."
good,"Great place to work, come in everyone is friendly and helpful. Management to hands on and easy to approach about any issues or concerns. Not hard to catch on and learn how they like to do things."
good,It's a great opportunity to learn and communicate with your customers needs and wants. Great for learning or putting your foot in the door for future sale reps
good,"One of the highest paid positions within a Best Buy location without being in MGT. It's pretty easy if you are consistent and persistent, and capable of building a team of advocates within your store.  You should be personable and come from a background of customer service and/or sales to really excel in this role, or otherwise be GREAT at making friends and getting people excited about things."
good,"making sales "
good,Not available and I am currently working there.  I do not wish to disclose this while I am working for the company.  There is no option to skip this step.
good,"Overall Best Buy is an amazing company. Managers want to help you be successful regardless of where you end up working in life. However, company makes it too difficult to fire managers who have been in their role for too long and not doing anything to progress the brand nor employees."
good,"I recently starting working there and I think that Best Buy has a very fun working environment. The coworkers are very friendly and the management is helpful too. It is a suitable job for college and university students if worked part-time. Moreover, I am learning the art of selling which will be very useful in life in general. The con of working at Best Buy is that it will get very hard during Black Friday and on the Christmas season as you will have to deal with multiple customers at once on the floor. Overall, it's not a hard job when you are not dealing with too many customers."
good,Most of the time the hours at work are flexible and you are able to choose when you want to take lunch. You are also able to dictate how your day goes and you can choose what the work environment feels like for you.
good,"Great place to work as you also gain useful knowledge. surrounded by fellow employees who help build you up, not tear you down. i only worked seasonal last year but would the chance to work there full time."
good,Working at Best Buy is great if looking for a retail position. This is where customer service meets tech - a great learning experience for sure! Working here built a great foundation for me to build my career on.
good,"A typical day at Best Buy mobile was doing account look ups for customers and making sure all of our clients were happy with phone plans/ upgrades and wireless carriers that were selected."
good,If you’re tech savvy you’ll love it !!! The discounts are amazing and I never had a problem with management. They are flexible with you schedule for the most part which is always a plus.
good,"Pretty nice atmosphere, management is great. Had a decent time working there. I don't want to write anymore so I'm just writing this as there's a minimum on letters for a review, really indeed?"
good,I started at Best Buy at 16. I just now left at 18. It has greatly improved my sales skills as well as my customer engagement skills. Great place for building experience!
good,"I enjoyed my season with Best Buy. Nothing more or less, really. It was a great opportunity to learn a lot of new things alongside a very interesting senior technician."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Typical day included conculting customer needs on a variety of different products and services. This could range anywhere from televisions to cloud computing. The best part is that you aren't married to a particular section as you can cross train in different deparments via elearnings. This allows for creating a more informed and more complete sales employee.
good,My typical day at work consisted mainly of helping customers choose the right computers and tools for the lifestyle while also respecting their price limits.
good,This is a great company that is keeping up as a brick and mortar in a world of amazon. You need to have comfortable shoes and be friendly with people. You will always be learning.
good,I loved working for Best Buy. Working retail is never easy but working here was as good as retail got. I started in October 2011 and left to advance in my career field in 2017. Management varied but overall I loved my team and environment. Discount is awesome and the 401k plan was great.
good,Very fun to work at with a lot of energy flowing. Always the greatest technology with energetic managers. Managers are very relatable and help you to achieve your goals.
good,Great place to be yourself and still be accepted not expected to conform. Encouraged to grow and develop at your own pace. Great benefits to fit all different needs. Bonus structure is very attractive and obtainable
good,"The work there is great. Dealing with the customers is the best reason to work there. Pay is competitive and depends a lot on your prior experience in that field. Benefits within the company are outstanding. Management needs improvement and can be the hardest part of the job to deal with, but the workplace culture is very team-oriented and makes up for that shortcoming."
good,The leadership staff is great to work with. Day to day is pretty easy. Can be very fast-paced depending on the department you work in. The store opens fairly early and closes pretty early too so work/life balance is great no matter the shift you chose.
good,"Working at Best Buy has been a great growing experience as for as ability to work is a busy environment but help clients quickly and with accuracy. Being able to grow my people skills, team collaboration skills, and project management skills through our different programs, services, and volunteer events with our community."
good,I always had some sort of fun with my coworkers at work. Always made sure to provide the best customer service while teaching the customer about the product.
good,"Depending on your store it might be difficult to advance your position as there are more roles for part time than full time. The managers I have however are great, and generally strive to make a better work environment and help us along the way."
good,"I enjoyed working here. The environment was quiet. ""Veteran"" associates were great at giving advice or helping with questions from employees or customers. Store layout was good. Point of sale systems were fairly simple to learn and use."
good,The company where everything is built on the mind. But whether it will be comfortable for you to work there it depends on who will be your team leader
good,"It was great to be the Hero..."
good,"Coworkers, Incentives, and benefits are amazing at Best Buy, bit after working there for 3 years, you get burned out due to pushy management breathing down your neck about hitting sales targets."
good,"Provide personalized service and exceptional expertise for customers. "
good,"Best buy was definitely one of my favorite places to work. The work atmospheres was great and was definitely a nice relaxing place to be.  "
good,"Best Buy is a great after high school place to work, with a good life/work balance and many opportunities to advance in the company. Well structured and management is great. The work environment is also great."
good,This is a fun and flexible place to work with a great diverse work culture. plenty of opportunity for advancement. Great employee discount and a wonderful management staff.
good,"Has an excellent company culture around advancement and ethics. Staff is passionate, benefits are solid, and compensation is better than most other retail outlets. However, there is virtually no leadership training so advancement is entirely dependent on your managers, and thus is a constantly moving goal post. If you work hard toward a promotion and your supervisor gets promoted before you, you are likely to be passed over for someone with a ""better idea"", leading to a great deal of turnover."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"A typical day at work includes engaging with customers, resolving customer escalations, coaching and training employees, running numbers and setting goals for the customer service team, opening and closing duties, handling large amounts of cash, communicating with other departments and leaders. I've learned how to be a more effective coach and leader, the value of being persistent with coaching, and really take pride in seeing my lower performers be coached into top performers. The Best Buy workplace culture is very effective in cultivating communication between departments; teamwork and support for each other eliminates the negative competitive aspect I've seen in other sales situations. The hardest part about my position at Best Buy is that advancement opportunities are few and far between due to the fact that superiors enjoy their positions so much that open leadership positions don't come up very often. The most enjoyable part of this job and any sales or customer service job is the chance to make customer connections that I can follow up with and turn into real and trusting relationships that are both meaningful and lucrative. My current management team is very supportive and helpful for my development, if not as proactive as I would sometimes like. Overall, Best Buy has been a wonderful company to work for with excellent benefits and an extremely caring leadership team."
good,Best Buy is a good work place to start out and get the support to grow. But once you have grown you will most likely need to move on due to either lack of career advancements or pay. I had a great time and couldn't be where I am now without them.
good,The coworkers that i have are very nice and fun to would with. The management that i have are willing to help you if you need anything. Plus in the break rooms there's a PS4 and a Xbox
good,Great place to get to know the culture behind bestbuy\s geek squad. A great place to get to know clients and help them understand technology and products.
good,Good work environment with the right management. Always room to grow but requires a very flexible schedule. Benefits for full time employees are pretty good.
good,Best Buy is a decent place to work. Good benefits and work schedule. Career development for most. Multiple locations and positions to choose from.  Full time and part time shifts start as early at 7am.
good,People there were very nice and were always willing to give a helping hand. A big plus in working for Best Buy is the flexibility in the work schedule.
good,The environment is fast paced but the job can be really fun and you learn a lot. It is not commission but you do have sales targets to meet. Management is great and helpful.
good,I had a lot of fun being apart of the home theater Installation team. Typical day was hanging t.v's. What made the job so rewarding was the multiple personalities I get to see each day. My customers really made my day especially after they see the world fearful job you've done. Some days where better than others but a staying positive really pushes you through.
good,"Long shifts, but team was amazing. They were the only reason I worked there as long as i did. Boxing days and big sales days were tough. Hard to start a family with the hours in retail."
good,"Typically the day starts off good,high energy with everyone ready to get the day over with if you wanted to say that. Managers are rude 50%-60% of the time and often have a power struggle between one another. Often I would find myself going to other managers who were more 'enjoyable' to converse with. Overall it's a good place to work at if you enjoy being surrounded by electronics."
good,"I have been working at Best Buy part-time (Less than a year)"
good,"I liked working at Best Buy. I started as a seasonal employee, but gained respect and the trust of the managers and was hired as a part-time employee. I was there about eight months and it was great. Very relaxed, sometimes busy, but organized. Management is iffy. When I told them I had to leave and put my two weeks notice in, they got mad at me and are avoiding me. Discount is great too. They give you working hours based on your performance and goals for the store. If you do not make the goal, you work about 10-11 hours a week."
good,Best Buy is great at working with students. They are flexible and understanding and are willing to help you out as long as you have the desire to work there.
good,"Sell product, pitch protection plans ,total tech support. the worst was dealing with all the delivery issues. Some managers were really good others not so much."
good,"Best Buy at millenia is a great place to work, but it is a plus to know Spanish or Portuguese as most of the customers are internationals. You'll even see some celebrities from time to time."
good,Like any place it had good and bad employees/managers but overall it was pretty nice. It was a seasonal position so I didn't really have the opportunity to advance. Nice environment and in a nice area.
good,"Management is mostly fair and workers are very positive, good to be around. Great team building experience. Would recommend for anyone trying to start a career on sales."
good,"For me the job itself was amazing, made great friends and it was the stepping stone to get my life and career to other heights and for that I am grateful"
good,Awesome place to work at if you are a student. It is not a place for a parent or someone with dependents. Management is great and the discounts are 20% over cost.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"As far as retail stores go this is a good company to work for. Sales associates are paid full wages and not on commission, with the focus on sales being to take care of the customers so that they will come back. This leads to a much lower level of stress compared to other sales jobs that are commission based. Benefits are available to part-time employees as well as full-time. Great opportunities for advancement."
good,I learned how to work the register for the first time and experience how brutal Black Friday can be during the season. The workplace culture was great and so were many of the customers.
good,The managers were very helpful and would work with you on attaining your goals. A typical day would consist of trying to reach a specific goal of sales to help ensure the store was reaching the overall day's goal of sales. Always ensuring customers were satisfied and never paid more for what they needed.
good,I truly enjoy working part-time at Best Buy.  The atmosphere is pretty chill and it gives me a different perspective than my full-time position as a programmer in a cubical all day.  A chance to interact more with people from all walks of life.
good,Great team of people that always put customers first Managers are understanding and always willing to help whenever you need. Everyone is helpful and friendly
good,"J ai la chance en travaillant dans le département de Ventes Multi-canaux et de pouvoir toucher à tout, Je vend ce que le client à réservé en ligne donc chaque vente est différente."
good,"My management team was good, I enjoyed showing up to work when I could, and the only thing I didn't like was the down time at times between checkouts."
good,i was working on the biggest location in new york which allowed me to work with the great sales mans in the country. Many other retailers recognize the skills you gain from this establishment.
good,"I'll keep this pretty simple, Best Buy is a great place to work the only downfall is the lack of hours for part time employees. Was guaranteed at least 20 hours a week and haven't gotten that since Christmas holiday ended. So if you can get into a full time position then its a great place to be!"
good,Loved working here. I owe all of my leadership development and knowledge to Best Buy. It truly was a company that cared for it's employees and their growth and development
good,"I worked at multiple best buys and overall it is a fantastic company to work for. However, just like any job, management can make or break your experience. The first two stores I worked at were great and it was retail at its finest. My third store was going through a revamp phase and the store manager was constantly calling people out to the point of embarrassment in front of 50 to 60 employees at a time. To avoid this, question your interviewer to get to know more about your management team."
good,"Each day was relaxed. As long as you were doing your job the management team wouldn't bother you. You were still able to have fun while working. There are a lot of E-Learnings to do, but they are easy and quick. They gave you a chance to do something else besides what you do everyday."
good,"Starting out, most of your time is spent out front at the Geek Squad counter either checking customers in and checking their devices back out, or testing returned items for open-box resale. But, as long as an incoming device isn't being sent into the back, you will still get the chance to help people solve some of their problems. Other, more experienced coworkers can have valuable insight, and I personally was able to learn many little things to help with troubleshooting devices in the future, particularly with Windows 10, which was much newer at the time I was employed there. Geek Squad and Customer Service shared the same counter-space at my store, and it made for a fun way of mixing two different types of employees together. Pressure for sales goals can be the biggest turn-off here, when you just want to help people. But, at Geek Squad, at least, they were just kind of there, but not rigidly enforced. I always put honesty above up-selling, so if I could provide a more cost-effective alternative for the client, I would. I would say Geek Squad work is far more preferable to Call Center or Help Desks for people looking to take their first steps into IT. I only left my store because of unfortunately timed relocation."
good,"My experience with Best Buy was for the most part exceptional. The hourly wage was comfortable, and the MCSA position was a good fit for myself. Management was always professional, while keeping it fun!"
good,"Best buy was overall a fun place to work. Pretty relaxed most days. Needed to meet your sales goals given to you by the store manager."
good,"It was a standard work place environment, the management was very understanding, but were also firm. Each lead supervisor was really helpful in training new members of the organization."
good,got a chance to meet and have relationships with a lot of different people and hold ties with customers. overall nice experience and was always rewarded for a job well done
good,The management I experienced at best buy is the best I have ever had. They were very enjoyable to be around while offering great opportunity and rewarding hard work. When dealing with personal medical issues management could not have been more supportive in working towards helping me achieve health in work and my life outside of work.
good,Best Buy is a wonderful company! Very solid values that are enforced in every department and facet within the company. I've seen many people be promoted from within the organization to other departments.
good,"The job is great, work with amazing people and have great opportunities to learn about technology in today's age. However with the job being a retail job, there are lots of customers that can be upsetting or belittle you. There's tons of flexibility in the job so you wont have to pick between the job and school or your social life. There will always be a way to find something that works out for both you and your team with scheduling."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Loved working at Geek Squad!!! Miss it. I wish we got more raises was only downside . I’d go back today if I could. Every day was different. Working with very cool people
good,"This is a job, not a career for someone who has a family. Only gives you a 401k, not a retirement. Management was great, being able to see your ideas come to life, networking, traveling, and bonuses."
good,"This was my first job as a non active duty member of the Air Force. It was fun, and hard work, but overall I had no complaints. Of course you can't control customer behavior, but the team is built on respect, diversity, and all reaching a common goal. I enjoyed my time working there."
good,l'environnement de travail est agréable et les personne
good,"Always felt welcomed with open arms"
good,"I have worked with Bestbuy for over a year and It had its ups and downs just like any company. All in All, i enjoyed my time spent with the company and would recommend it to anyone searching for job with a flexible schedule and management that is willing to train."
good,Best Buy is an amazing company to work for. Depending on the management team you are working for the environment is great! The community work they do is amazing to be a part of.
good,"when i started they were merging repair technician jobs with installer at no increased compensation."
good,Management was great. Some favoritism but overall fair treatment. Easy going should you not be able to make it to work as well. They always tried to help you catch up on any missed hours.
good,There are ways to advance and the management will allow if you show no flight risk. A lot of skills training and vetting for the positions at hand to make sure that you fit.
good,I worked at best Buy warehouse at Langley. I had 5 different positions in 1 year. The culture is really good and all managers/team-leads are well trained and very respectful.  There is a big chance for advancement  within the company. Very good employee discounts.
good,"It is a fun place to work. All employees like to joke around with each other, you need a sense of humor and patience. Everybody gets along well for the most part. Management is really cooperative with your schedule as well."
good,"If you love people and while promoting technology, this is a job for you. The only thing that I had a problem with BestBuy was the management. Most of the managers were fair and very understanding with their employee matters. Then there were some managers who were horrible. The scheduling for their employees was very impulsive to where they would change the next day and they would not even tell you ahead of time."
good,Best Buy offers a lot of different ways to train and prepare you for future jobs in business. Working full time gives a huge insight into the company with the meetings they have every month.
good,"Overall, my experience at Best Buy was a good one as I worked under different managers, supervisors, and in several different positions throughout my career with the company. I learned many skills in the fields of Sales, Customer Service, Technology, etc. The only problems I had with the company was poor management and they were unwilling to work with you in regards to a schedule (school, second jobs, etc). As stated above, I would give the company an overall rating of 4/5. I left the company due to a better opportunity."
good,"Every day was typically fun. I never felt tired to be there really. I cannot speak for anyone else, but I always spoke highly of my Best Buy team. I was working part time, but there were full time opportunities."
good,"- greeted by managers and coworkers "
good,"Overall my time at Best Buy was great. It is a fun place to work and gives employees the opportunity to grow professionally. One of the biggest things I learned while working there is how to network. You meet a plethora of different people who come into the store everyday, each with their own personality and different issues. Best Buy has taught me how to be a young professional and personable."
good,Helps build sales a customer service skills. They teach you to listen to customers to align them with the right products and services. they should pay there employees some type of commission.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,to be honest it wasnt the worst place i worked the people are nice and the wor was easy and th management was most of the time awesome a few people were meh tho but hey what u gunna do.
good,Best Buy is one of the better jobs I have ever had. The company actually cares about its employees and they have several programs to help you grow in the company and in life. The benefits are awesome too.
good,I was able to harvest talent and develop leaders for the organization. The ability to train personnel and watch them progress professionally and personally while they in turn were also contributing to the further success of the organization was very rewarding.
good,it was ok working there great team members not to busy. care about your needs. very political instead of how hard you actually work to be better. and to move up especially if you are a female
good,"friendly coworkers and nice supervisors, customers are very friendly and usually knows what they want. It's not usually a high paced job, on a regular day you might help about 5-10 people in my department; home theater"
good,"I really enjoyed it. I wish the store was hiring for long term positions at the time, but all of those positions were full. I would recommend the job to anyone that likes working with people and electronics."
good,"I worked at Best Buy for four years while going to school and it taught me a lot of things that I used in my career now.  It helped me build confidence in sales, and also teach me how to interact with various types of people.  I owe a lot of my career success to Best Buy.  The pay wasn't the greatest, but when looking back, I have great memories of working there."
good,"The people made the difference at the store I worked for. They were all very supportive and fun to be around with. "
good,Once your in and met everyone its more like a family then a job. Everyone gets along with everyone vice versa. It was one of my favorite jobs i've had and will highly recommend it
good,"Best Buy provides a wealth of knowledge, as well as insight in the workings around the retail culture. Moving up through the leadership team helps ensure a strong sense of leadership wherever you bring that."
good,"Best place to get entry-level experience especially for customer service. Workplace is great, co-workers is friendly. Discount is awesome. They need to get a qualified/certified employee to work on the computers. They also need to provide current employees training and certification for their career advancement."
good,Going to work was almost like a party every day with good people. Only annoying thing is the training session that is periodic and must be done but you can take your time while you do it so as to complete it satisfactorily.
good,"I learned a lot about talking to new people everyday"
good,"Best buy as a company is a very good company to work for. It is very competitive and if your goal isn't to be the best salesman in the building, I'd look for another job. It is a very fun and high paced environment and is filled with energy."
good,Best Buy culture has always created a strong sense of belonging for many people.  Coworkers are usually friendly and willing to help.   Management will work with your concerns and people are always willing to teach you more about their specialized field of technology.
good,"A typical day at work would usually consist of greeting costumers, directing them in the location of certain products, spending time with each costumer and making sure they are satisfied with everything. My coworkers were always very friendly and more then happy to help if i had any questions."
good,I enjoyed where i worked and the people I worked with. It was fast paced but relaxing all in one. I did my job accordingly but was let go because of seasonal reasons.
good,"Best Buy can be great everything is great BUT it can get so stressful when you don’t meet your rev goals. You have to sell certain dollar amount by each hour depending on what department you work on. Not based on commission but recognition. Sucks how it still feels like competition when we all are working for the same company. Individual sales tracked.  Besides that, great paid time off, discounts, pay and hours."
good,"Best Buy, as a company, is amazing. They aren't super demanding and give you every tool necessary to succeed. The only flaw can be found in an in-store level. The job is only as good as your bosses. My bosses changed a few times within a year. With inexperienced and incompetent management, the current work environment is stressful, demeaning, and oppressive. People quit bosses, not jobs. Before new management, the store was cohesive, inviting, and fun. We succeeded in our goals, and enjoyed the environment. Your experience with Best Buy will simply be based on what store you go to. Love the company, just can't stand my management."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Your expirience with Best Buy will be heavily based on the store you work on and your management, but in about 2 years of working for the company I really enjoyed my expirence. The Company is working to evolve and works to be a fun place to work. Pay is below average, however, but good management and coworkers help make up the balance."
good,"Productive and intriguing work environment. Learned great multitasking skills and time management skills. Great experience of selling electronics, helped with product knowledge."
good,"The store I work at is pretty great. But not all Best Buy are the same, they are set by rankings. A higher ranking Best Buy will have more opportunities than a lower ranking best buy (such as mine). Revenue band 1 stores are the lowest, your raise wont be much and if you thinking of advancing from a position you might have to look for anothee Best Buy, also if you’re part-time and want to become full-time the only way that can happen if a fulltimer in your department leaves. A Revenue band 3-6 are bigger Best Buy with greater opportunities and better pay. Working in the warehouse is great, you dont deal with customers as often and most of the time you have free time. Just know what your priorities are first and once thats done you have a lot of free time until your shift is over."
good,"As a Microsoft Expert my day-to-day job was to ensure that the Microsoft Store within Best Buy was clean and fully stocked at all times, I was also directly responsible for ensuring that all Computer Sales Consultants were always up-to-date on any promotions running on Microsoft products and services, as well as training them on how to use and how to sell Microsoft products and services. Overall it was a great role within the company, and opened up a lot of opportunity for growth and personal development. I had multiple opportunities to travel and visit multiple Microsoft centers and locations to learn more and work closer to Microsoft teams to help shape the future of their products and services. The biggest struggle I faced at my location was Best Buy management; They expect nothing but 110% from you at all times, and even when you consistently show high sales volume and continuous growth year-after-year they tell you that you are never doing enough. They did a great job at making you feel replaceable, and that you were just a number."
good,"I enjoyed working with my peers. Never a dull moment within the building. All my peers, including managers, were very nice to me and each other as well. Felt like a family. Working in the video game department was great. I learned a lot from the other departments. It was like going to school and being taught many things."
good,Typical day at work is working with clients and project managers to design custom solution. I have learned about how to manage my time and how to work with others towards common goals. The management team is excellent and always has my back on the projects I am working on. The culture is largely one of comradery with some healthy competition. The hardest part is never really being off or having weekends to spend with friends and family. The most enjoyable parts of the job are closing the sale and seeing the excitement in a client's face when their project is completed.
good,"plenty of opportunity to advance,ongoing updated training,upper management engaged with all tier levels with staff some favoritism shown to certain employees quite apparent to the entire work force,one team one dream ,really means something there,loved working with my coworkers and the public,breaks were sometimes hard to get so some body aches would come into play-minor issue, the break room is awesome couches large tv appliances and they provided food snacks drinks for entire store quite often"
good,The job mostly depend on fixing and restarting computers and devices. The co-workers are fun and enjoyable to be around and they  teach and answer questions properly and help out which is very helpful for new employees.
good,"I liked this company. But in this company everything there is very dependent on who will be your team leader. Since the first minutes spent in the company you feel a strict order in everything. The company does not throw money for employees: all for money in the cafeteria, even coffee and tea. Salaries are very average. Frequent dismissals."
good,"Even though I'm quite new here, I've enjoyed my time with other team members. There is always something to do, and other team members are always willing to teach you new things."
good,"Best Buy is a very flexible company with admirable company values and morals. To be able to be apart of their exemplary work environment is the most enjoyable part of the job. Aside from having a fun work environment, I have also acquired numerous skills and life lessons the past 3 1/2 years at this workplace, including teamwork and as well as individual work. I learned that a friendly, but yet competitive work environment optimizes work. I also learned the importance of setting goals and finding ways to improve even if the goals are met. The significance of constant evaluation of previous work process and discovering new methods to achieve higher success. The only downside I would have to give about Best Buy is the lack of company advancement."
good,"I really liked working at Best Buy. The co-workers and management were all very friendly. The only thing is for a tech store the technology available to employees is very lacking. The computers that run the registers are very old and often crash. I lost large sales multiple times just because the computer crashed or there was an issue with the central server. Very frustrating. Also, having to explain to a customer that Best Buy's shipping takes far longer than Amazon, etc. often lost sales."
good,"it was great to go in and work, you get to interact with your co workers a lot and also help customers. there isn't any pressure to hit sales as they are non commission, the only problem is when it is slow in the store it can get really boring."
good,"I deal with upset clients as a part of my job. I enjoy the challenge of making upset clients into happy clients. The 401k, health insurance and other benefits are great. However, the hourly pay is below what an entry level IT employee would receive in a non-retail environment."
good,Best buy taught me what it's like to have fun while getting the job done. The 936 store was the best and taught me the importance of providing great customer service
good,"It was an overall good experience. They took the time to help me perfect my sales skills. Management was very patient and they were understanding and corrected the problem, not just address the incidents."
good,Its fun to be around the new technology. Great learning environment and good management. Hardest part of the job is dealing with holiday traffic and rude customers but most interactions are good.
good,training is fun and people are fun to work with. great management and training. employee development is key which always makes for a great work environment
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Management was very good and fair.  Employees are given the tools to do their job and aren't hounded constantly if they hold up their end.  Management actively tries to engage employees in constructive and fun ways.  Pay scale is very similar to unions, very hard to reward exceptional work financially.  Some room for growth but largely has to be right place, right time, some promotions long overdue."
good,"Provided personalized service and product expertise to customers"
good,"This Best Buy job was the best job I have had so far to date. From the management team all the way down to Asset Protection, everyone in the store worked together to ensure the success of sales throughout the day."
good,"Best Buy was great, fun place to work. I enjoyed the fast paced environment. All the other employees were easy to work with. Being a part of Best Buy felt like being part of a family"
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work. The work culture is great and benefits are amazing. Also, the amount of training and one on one leadership meetings are a plus."
good,"We would set the ad, unload, sensor and push product to the floor,do all signage. clean, dust, vacum, wire maintenance. Guest assistance, search for missing product and report it's issue. Also build and set all displays."
good,the staff were as welcoming as family. They helped me learn what the companies culture was about and helped me maintain the companies culture through teamwork.
good,I worked in Geek Squad as a repair tech. It's a solid intro to It for those looking to get into the industry but is lacking in some areas. You're exposed to industry tools and are encouraged to move up in the company.
good,staff was like a second family best buy and geek squad have a great culture part time employees are sometimes hard to deal with it was hard to have to cover their shifts and have a personal life at home
good,"Excellent team engagement and growth opportunities; "
good,Really great starter job! Very flexible with your schedule when you're below a supervisory level. Management can vary between locations. The overall culture is ideal and I really enjoyed my 10 yeas there!
good,Working with customers to help them with their electronics and help them find electronics to help fit their family's need was a lot of fun. I enjoyed learning about computer systems and working with a team.
good,"Best Buy has a system that tracks your sales thoroughly. This is good because it encourages you and lets you know what you can improve on. Sometimes, they are not great at giving an exact representation of your performance."
good,"It's honestly unfortunate that this was more of a temporary position as far as most of the staff go. It was a company that admittedly did care more about salesmen than the support team, however, a business will inevitably be that way. Overall a great experience and people and memories I will likely treasure moving forward."
good,Great place to learn and work. The day is scout was awesome when I worked there. They gave benefits to both full and part time employees. Really good balance between my work and life. Only reason I left was that they shut my store down and laid me off.
good,As a sales associate there is competitive pay. With time your coworkers will become like family and the management appears to care about your career and personal interests.
good,"-Fast paced environment that encompasses all aspects of running a small-scale business"
good,"I enjoy working at my current job, but I would really enjoy getting more hand on work with my current degree which is network administration/cyber-security."
good,"I worked for another dept store before Best Buy, so my experience for training was not too difficult. I am also a quick learner so training was simple and a lot quicker than others. I became one of their top cashiers and was requested by customers. I was also trained in customer service to work with exchanges and returns, Sometimes I had to deal with very bad customers but was able to make them happy before leaving the store. I also had to answer telephones directing people to whom they needed to talk to. I liked working here very much and was liked very much by employees and customers. I would probably still be there but wanted to get back to manufacturing. I still shop in the same store and always get asked to come back, but I like manufacturing and quality control, plus Monday through Friday work weeks, with some Saturdays when needed."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Discount is great but used to be better.. I love to be around Technology and this job provided me to see new tech on a daily basis. I loved the team culture but i had to leave based on the pay.
good,I managed several different stores for the company. I learned a lot about Leadership from my experiences with this company. They have a great training program and teach a lot of leadership skills. The pace is very fast .
good,the day started off clocking in and dealing with merchandise and dealing with customer.
good,I enjoyed the strong management team and fun atmosphere of Best Buy. I enjoyed that they are team motivated and eager to see new employees flourish and succeed.
good,"A typical day for Sales Support at Best Buy is kind of slow in the morning. From 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. the focus is on Morning paperwork and preparing returns and services to be shipped out.  At 9 a.m. is when we start receiving orders for pick-up, delivery or ship to home."
good,Best buy is such a great place to work and to learn new technologies. I enjoy speaking with customer most as it helps them with their daily needs. The hardest part may be has to do with getting familiarize with technology in a short period of time.
good,"One of the best jobs that I have had. Constantly learning on the job for product knowledge and selling skills however, management picks favorites very quickly and you can be set aside from everyone else even when you are a hardworker"
good,"Good place nice people nice discounts"
good,"Coworkers are what make this job. Very friendly and a sense of camaraderie was prominent. Manager was very caring, although cross-department managers often gave tasks that conflicted with my work."
good,"Best Buy is a great place with a friendly work environment, as well as great perks/benefits. It has great training as well as potential to move up in the retail world."
good,A shift in customer service at Best Buy typically consisted of doing return/exchanges of products from customers. Creating orders of products for customers if the product we had wasn't in stock. Closing out online orders when customers would come in to pick up their items they ordered online. And overall assisting customers who needed any kind of help.
good,"Great staff, management, organizational structure. There are plenty of opportunities to advance yourself within the company. Great benefits, hours are standard,"
good,"It was fun, temporary work. I sold Canon printers. I earned commissions and interacted with customers. I gave demos. Pay was $15/hr from BDS Marketing."
good,"Fast days lots of new faces in and out of door, lots of numbers and metrics to keep up with. Non commission based so management needs to make sure you are doing what you need to do."
good,Great development if you work with your leaders on it. Inside and outside training available. Really care about their employees. Some of the best benefits in the industry from healthcare to financial advisors to family planning. Corporate is very hands on in developing the company in a great way based on customer service.
good,"I enjoyed my job, and the people I worked with. We all had each others back like a family. We would have fun while being the best.  The culture that best by has is one that I agree with and follow.  The management team at my location is definitely  hands down the best I have ever worked for. They truly cared about their employees."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Extremely fun place to work, as well as supportive. We were like a family, we were always there for each other. We gave each other advice and tips to help grow with the company."
good,Your day consists of morning meatings so don't be late.  Sales floor duties all day long.  There was a break for lunch and a second small 10/15 min in the after noon.   Night duties consist of stocking shelves and unloading trucks for the warehouse.  What I learned here was the sales process and verbage for good customer interaction via all of the vendors training classes.
good,I was a part time employee so I had plenty of balance between life and work. My hours started to go up as time went on with me working there at the job.
good,"Managers are great, co workers are mostly younger. Very willing to help each other. Employees tend to cycle in and out. Ive met some good friends working there but they have left."
good,"BB sincerely puts the employee first.  From Corporate level down to the field, HR has a seat at the table; employee experience is a factor for all business decisions.  Celebrates employees for who they are and how they work best.  Open door policy and practice. Can trust upper management all the way to the top."
good,"I enjoyed working at Best Buy, I never really felt like I was working. I had a decent pay rate and I also got really good hours. They were very flexible with my schedule and worked me in the hours they knew we're most manageable for me. Also loved my Co-workers, the nicest, smartest and most enjoyable people I've ever worked with."
good,Love the managment great place to work for had it ups and downs but employees are taken Care of great pace to work at great Incentive's and being able to have fun
good,"Overall the company is headed in a great direction under the guidance of its current CEO and the work environment is better than that of your average retail store."
good,"Probably one of the best jobs that i EVER had , i loved the people that i worked with and they made having the job fun. I loved learning about all the new technology that was coming out"
good,no real issues besides some management issues. discounts were great. I really enjoyed working there because of all the discounts but the pay wasn't the best either.
good,Best Buy for the most part has been one of my most enjoyable working experiences. I love the fast paced environment and I also tremendously appreciate the way that everyone took a hand in making sure that my training process was a smooth and very informational process to make sure I was able and ready to fit right into the flow of the things once I was on my own.
good,"Working in a field that does delivery and installation, there are occasionally slow days. However, I received overtime pay quite often while working at Best Buy. There is a high demand for appliance delivery so I was never hurting for hours."
good,I had a lot of growth with bestbuy. I was a Car Audio installer for 8 years. Worked my way up to be a District Champion that oversaw 16 other stores with 2-3 techs per store. My job was to train them the correct ways of installing and customer service.
good,"I loved working here. The pay wasn't a livable wage, but what it lacked in pay, Best Buy makes up for in the job culture. Work was fun, and I felt appreciated, even when I felt my performance wasn't good enough. I had always looked forward to the next day I'd be able to work."
good,"It was a fun job, discounts were good but customers can be rude and stressful but once you learn to deal with it then you’ll be ok, my manager was really good and cool with us"
good,"I love Best Buy, my first job and I have had so  many opportunities within my store. Going into leadership was hard work but rewarding to get acknowledged for that hard work by both customers and your peers is an amazing feeling. The most stressful part is obviously the holidays and ""retail life""/schedule. The best part is definitely the benefits and the flexibility that can sometimes be the retail life especially with school."
good,"Very friendly, yet competitive work environment. Team puts customer first. Very in depth training to ensure that you will not be put into a situation with a customer or a sale that you cannot handle due to lack of training or product knowledge. Consistent feedback and coaching."
good,"Day to day you work in a commission like environment that doesn't pay commission. You have many challenges throughout the day that sometime require creative solutions which I thoroughly enjoy. I've learned to manage my time and raise to the issues that clients have with their experiences. I've learned how to deliver world class customer service to earn the loyalty of people who come into the store. There is workplace drama - as Best Buy is usually filled with college aged workers, but it shouldn't affect the people who make a point to stay out of it. The work environment and management can be very great and included in the most enjoyable parts of the job. Hardest part is probably the expectations of commission-based performance but not commission-based pay."
good,Enjoyable place to work because majority of your co workers love working there and are all so informed and trained in their specific field. On the other hand customers can be unpredictable meaning you'll have days where customers our very friendly other days they might not be you just have to deal with it.
good,"People were nice enough, managers are pretty understanding. If you like fast paced environments you can really thrive.Overall an amazing place to work."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Management closely tracks associates performances which means if you're in a busy market there's not really in down time. You pretty much go form customer to customer the entire shift.
good,"Working at best buy made me realize that working with people are amazing. They make sure your good and make sure your good to work. If i needed a shift taken on a late notice then they would be able to take it. The managers, they make sure you are at your best and make sure your good while working."
good,On a Typical day we lived by have fun while being the best. Hands down one of the best jobs i worked at the enjoyable part of the job was seeing how happy we made clients when they came in to pick up there product. The hardest part of the job was always around the holidays. I've learned how to be a people person how to conduct a professional conversation and how to work under a fast pace
good,"Working at the Best Buy in Harvey, LA, was a great experience, although it was shortlived due to employee greed and drama. No, we sales associates don't work on commision, but in a sense we do. Our sales are tracked and must meet sales goals to maintain productivity and store goals. This is very good in practice but for a large superstore with multiple employees, it's terrible. I've had multiple cases where my fellow employees stole sales by replacing employee numbers on the official transaction, to the point that losing multiple multi-thousand dollar sales drove me near the bottom of the ""scoreboard"" and my hours took a tole. My managers did nothing about it, as well to any other employees who ever suffered. My supervisor even used my few hours without my knowledge. The company is fantastic but Best Buy in Harvey was one of my least enjoyable employments."
good,Best Buy offers great compensation for employees and great benefits. Managers and coworkers are very friendly. Great opportunity for advancement if you're looking for a career. I feel very comfortable working here.
good,I was always up to date with the newest tech. Everyone was very friendly and we were all a team. management was very nice to us and gave us fun incentives.
good,Very easy going; get to meet new people everyday and assist them with products that they may not understand or have issues with using. Multiple employees around so if you may know know something specific or you may need more recommendation then there are enough people to help.
good,"BestBuy- Accenture is hub of Retail Industry specialists."
good,"Best Buy holds a lot of advancement opportunities, but it requires a lot of dedication and time. You have to maintain a positive attitude, even in the face of extremely unpleasant customers, which you encounter often."
good,best buy overall has made my working experience the best yet. it Ha taught me many things like communicating and connecting with others and also how to work as a team
good,"I worked in Best Buy Mobile! Very fun, high energy department! Many opportunities to move up within the company. I learned about the ins & outs of cell phone companies within the first two weeks of working there."
good,"Accommodation,interacting with others,Flexible schedule,friendly staff,great discount,enters,corrects and verifies data on the computer,processes delivery distribution center paperwork."
good,Working at Best buy helped me move forward in a lot of ways as far as how the retail industry works in all aspects. Great for entry level positions with potential to advance with dedication.
good,"Completely absurd availability requirements for full-time employees.  It's like they designed it to keep single parents from working there.  Other than that, it's a fantastic place to work.  If they paid more and were more flexible with scheduling, I probably would never leave."
good,"Geek Squad culture is pervasive throughout the company, and is intentionally cheesy - but also friendly, and conducive to building strong teams.  As CEO, Hubert Joly focused on Geek Squad as a pillar of Best Buy and as a result, created many strong career prospects."
good,"Associates are great to talk to and plenty of electronics and gadgets to learn from. For a promotion to move up, employees will need to stay for years within the same building or move to a different location. While pay is low at the lowest position, it's a great job that can be enjoyed."
good,"A great environment; however, as a product process specialist. This position was not uplifting when having to stand at the front receptionist the majority of the day. However, merchandising items kept me busy which allowed me to communicate with customers; which taught me how to communicate with customers."
good,Have fun while being the best the company is always currently changing. We strive to be the best. The training is only continuing and getting better. The pay could improve at least in my area.
good,I have worked at Best Buy for 3+ years now and it has been a pretty great place to learn and grow. It is a company that cares about training its associates as well as allowing them to grow from within their store or many others.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"great company to work if your looking for a job. Do not need many much experience and most of the time you learn as you go. Many of the current associates teach you along the way, so you do not feel like you do not know anything. It is constantly growing along with technology."
good,"Great entry-level job, however, scarce chances to advance within company.  Prospects for positions may be jeopardized by changing of leadership that cannot speak to the character or things one can bring to-the-table."
good,"The people are awesome, the managers are awesome, and the work is easy. All of my co workers were friendly as soon as i arrive. They all look out for each other. I really felt apart of the team."
good,"A typical day for me start usually started yesterday as I like to prepare my day ahead and also I always have a plan for the week so I can keep track of my work and get the balance at the end of the week."
good,"This company has always been my favorite. I loved the job and I hope to find another fitting position again with this company. When I worked for Best Buy, I loved the work environment (I mean, who doesn't love working around new, advanced technology?) the employees and management were amazing people that I enjoyed getting to know, I came to work every day always earlier than my normal shift and would try to stay late as much as I could. I was always multi tasking and learning new things along with it. I wish I didn't have to move from this location because it was overall amazing. I love shopping and working with Best Buy."
good,"Best Buy has been my home for the last 6 years, they have taken care of me by not only encouraging me to go back to school and get my degree but also working with the busy college students schedule."
good,"I have been working here for half of my high school life. For a high school student, its a great place to work. they have great flexible hours. I worked in the computers department and could easily balance school and work."
good,"Great workplace culture, management is very helpful and willing to work with associates. Not very stressful or tedious job, it is a great place to connect with others."
good,"Overall what you would expect for working at Bestbuy, the only thing I didn't like was that we are required to force credit cards on people..unethical when it comes to your job relying on people taking a credit card. As a business Finance graduate, it's sad to see people getting suckered into credit cards for things they don't really need."
good,"Best Buy has done very well for me this past year, I've never been happier with any job in my life. All the people are great, customers and employees alike. The employees/management there is excellent when it comes to helping new employees and teaching really viable skills. The only part of the job that I found to be a little bothersome was the scheduling. If you go for part time, or even full time in some cases, they will cut your hours; in my case, hours were cut greatly and it was an inconsistent living. I need something more to support myself for the future. Overall it's a great place to work, maybe your experience going into it might be different from mine, but I have no hard feelings about it."
good,"I thorougly enjoyed working for Best Buy. I would not trade that experience for the world. The relationships that I made, not only with the associates but also with my customers is irreplaceable."
good,"Outside of the management issues, great job. Perfect job for a student. Great opportunity for advancement. Great work/life balance. Very Understanding and great benefits."
good,Best buy is a great place to work for it take time getting used to but all in all it makes up for years a learning and teaches you new things everyday.
good,"Plenty of opportunities to advance and learn new skills. It is definitely a corporate entity and it will show in training and reviews, but it is one of the better corporations to work for if you do not have a lot of experience."
good,"help assist with ringing products up for customer, also stocking new products that came in and set up new gaming systems. "
good,"Coming into work and getting ready was an exciting time. Helping people with any of their needs and learning on the way about the latest technological advancements. At the same time the experience gained from customer service and becoming confident and comfortable when in difficult or simple customer interactions. Sales and up selling was taught and now branded into my business logic used withing the everyday environment. In the end, what I took away from Best Buy was scarce and mostly unavailable for a teenager, the business guidelines and business experience will follow through for my entire business work ethic and skill."
good,"You learn a lot about corporate led retail locations, about dealing with customers and how to transact with other employees and customers. Merchandising and inventory are important aspects of the business and are positions that you really will learn a lot about. Management was spotty at times but overall encouraging and supportive."
good,Great place to work.  Wish I would have not left when my department closed down.  I took a severance and left because there was not an opportunity for me to make the money I was making.  I would go back but I do not want to repair computers and that is what they have in my range of pay.  The pressure is great there with computer repair.  This is why I do not want to apply for this.
good,"Best Buy has been awesome for me, they are flexible with the schedule and it got me all through college. I think some stores are better then others so there are some big changes depending on where you are but over all its a great company to work for. The benefits for full timers is very good and the discount on products varies but it nice. The pay is not the best buy again it depends on the store and how well they are doing. Over all you will meet some cool people but you will have a lot of work, especially in the operations side. Be ready to deal with customers in any position you hold there."
good,I enjoyed being part of the leadership and working with customer and employees everyday in a very welcoming and entertaining atmosphere. It also looks great on a resume

good,"As long as you get along with the majority of your department and management, you will find yourself looking forward to clocking in every day. Best Buy provides you with the right tools and training to consult with customers and their needs."
good,"Great place to work if you enjoy a fast paced, performance rewarded company. Typically promotes from within. Great compensation once you reach management level. The senior management is very employee centric based. I felt they generally care for their employees"
good,cool place to work where people are really genuine. Ability to experience technology when it comes out is a plus. Busy during the holidays regardless of the day of the week.
good,"Staff are always friendly, everybody is willing to help or work with you on projects. Yet management can be disorganized at times. the job is definitely the hardest during certain seasons ."
good,Best Buy is a good place to start when it comes to electronics and sales. They have a variety of training modules to familiarize you with products along with hands on experience. Being knowledgeable of products is beneficial to customers and sales such as show casing the latest vide games platform.
good,The only reason I am leaving the company is due to the closure of my location. I have been with Best Buy for 13 years and it has been an outstanding workplace.
good,"Good environment to be in, management is also pretty good. They work with you on scheduling and discount to employees pretty good."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work, with fantastic training programs and lots of opportunity for advancement."
good,"Best Buy provides a great place to start a career, to learn and grow. They cultivate a culture that is accepting and inclusive. I would recommend that anyone interested in Technology or Sales would benefit from working there."
good,Good Training with Geek Squads M.R.I. which is a live Operating System. This specific center is setting the standards for the district.
good,working in best buy has taught me a lot. I have grown in customer service and in technology knowledge. It is a fun place to work at and if you work hard you will get everything you want from the company.
good,"If this location wouldn't have closed I would have never left. The team was like a family, had a great relationship with all the management team. They were completely willing to back the employee especially when dealing with difficult customers."
good,"Assisted clients with tech support and troubleshooting."
good,"I learned how to deal with customers, there are different types of customers and I learned to deal with most of them. My co-workers made things easier for me I was able to adjust more comfortably because of them. The hardest part of the job is getting someone to buy something because most would just say I'm just looking."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,learning new things in the tech world pretty much every day. great benefits and great team to work with. I have learned a lot from this place which i did't think i would've.
good,"My main job was to help people buy computers. We're not on commission so it's not only about upset lung people to make money. I'm there to make sure that whoever I help gets everything they need with their purchase. Other than helping people, it's mainly just general upkeep of the sales floor, making sure tags are correct, stocking products, cleaning that kind of stuff. Management is helpful. You do have daily goals to hit and they will help you if you aren't hitting them. They do a lot of coaching a and training to help make sure you are doing well and know your products. My coworker are great, they are friendly and helpful if I have questions. It might be my store, but we all have a good relationship, workers and managers."
good,Best Buy is a very cool place to have a job. From learning Best buys merchandising strategies to learning inventory it has been exciting. My coworkers are always willing to help when I'm unsure about anything.The best part was learning to do many different things in multiple departments. The hardest part was seeing good coworkers go on to other jobs. Management is very flexible with schedules and try their best to make it work with personal life. Typical day at work is working on new products and doing regular inventory and truck work.
good,"i enjoyed working at best buy, and they gave great discounts and benefits. the training  was very detailed and hands on . The pay could have been a little better but it's still pretty decent."
good,"Home Theater in our store is towards the rear of the store.  A typical day is arriving to work, saying hello to about 5 or 6 people (sometimes many more,) and getting a couple high fives or fist bumps as well.  Lots of smiles, too. I continue to learn a lot about retail in general.  Just because I'm home theater doesn't mean I don't go into other departments.  Our store is committed to working as a team so if appliances or computers or other departments need help, we all help as best we can.  Our management team is outstanding.  They're incredible with knowledge on all the products and services and are willing to teach and guide us who are less knowledgeable at the drop of a hat.  I could say the same about my co-workers as well.  We have a very talented and friendly/helpful bunch of 'Blue Shirts.'  The hardest part of the job for me keeping up with how fast technology changes these days.  But, that's what leads me to really thank everyone I work there with for being willing to help each other out as needed."
good,As my very first sales job started at Best Buy. I had an amazing experience meeting new people everyday as well as the other people working be side me.
good,"When you work for Best Buy, you will learn a little bit about everything that they sell. The company is very family oriented and cares about anything going on in your life"
good,"I loved working for this company, the managers were great, the stores systems were easy to use and everything was just incredibly professional."
good,"I enjoyed working at 'Best Buy Fisheries' as it helped me become a more confident individual, my customer service skills were improved drastically; I acquired skills that I didn't have before being employed by 'Best Buy Fisheries' such as cash handling, as a result of this, I felt more comfortable in the workplace. "
good,"I love working at Best Buy. It is a great job to wake up too and go make sales. in my case i love customer satisfaction and selling product. so, bestbuy was the place for me. I have made some really great friends in my time here. This is still my current job and i still love it!"
good,"Regida por valores , te hace crecer en todos los ambitos, recibiendo contante retroalimentacion por parte de tus suoervisores y gerentes"
good,Great compensation and salaries for retail. Management and corporate were very helpful and proactive about workers perusing advancement opportunity. There are awesome accommodations and great environment to enjoy the work day.
good,"A typical day at work would involve interacting with customers and providing assistance in determining what product would be best for the customer.  It was a great environment to learn about new products and how to best work with other people of different age groups and knowledge level. Management had a clear goal on how to best assist you in learning how to better yourself and move forward in the company. Co-workers were the best part of the job because the people you worked with often had similar interest as you in your field.  There wasn't necessarily a hard part of the job, it was more of needing to have a strong desire to learn about new technology that is constantly being produced. The most enjoyable part of the job to me was being able to learn about new technology on a regular basis and being able to interact with new people every day."
good,"This is a great place to work minus a few locations, management is somewhat rude in some places, but others they are great"
good,Best Buy was a great experience to me. I learned a lot and developed my teamwork skills. The management helped me through this process by continuous group projects. My co-workers and I got a long very well and together we completed tasks effectively and efficiently.
good,My team was like a family. Hours were always guaranteed. Help was always provided. Room to move up. Benefits are great especially for students. My supervisors and manager always made me feel welcomed and gave constructive criticism.
good,"I'd go to work and handle a full register and install sales operations. I'd assist customers to purchase their products and making sure that they found everything they were looking for. When necessary, I'd handle several customers at once and answered questions about the merchandise. I'd also assist customers with special orders. The management was very organized and precise. My coworkers would always work together in giving each customer the best shopping experience. The hardest part of the job would be selling specific products. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in teams with my coworkers and getting the job done right."
good,"Soriana es una empresa excelente, solo que si esta totalmente enfocada al ambiente laboral, en lo personal descuide un poco mi vida personal por enfocarme a mi trabajo, sin embargo cuenta con buen ambiente de trabajo, corporativo siempre apoya para lograr los objetivos de tienda, aprendí a negociar con compras, a realizar estudios de competencia, evaluar precios, ventas, y establecer estrategias para lograr las metas."
good,"Allows problem solving when issues arrive, but is also a fun environment to work in while being productive. A good opportunity to build and better selling skills."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy is an excellent place to work for any level of experience. There is plenty of room for growth and development, as well as plethora opportunities for advancement within the company."
good,"A typical day at work would start as fast as it ended. There was never a dull moment. While working there I learned new skills i.e. picking product, replenishing product, and general warehouse skills. The hardest part of the job was getting use to the daily physical aspects of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the environment."
good,"Over the 5 years I have been with Best Buy I worked my way from a entry level Geek Squad position to a corporate level field technician. For me, this is one of the marks of a good company. One that recognizes determination and hard work, and encourages growth, both individually and professionally."
good,"I was hired as a Seasonal Part Time Customer Service Associate from October 2015-January 2016. I had a fun time working at Best Buy, did my part in volunteering for the Midnight launch of Halo 5 and helping out with the midnight shifts renovating our store for 3 weeks in November for the Holidays. Met some really cool people that I easily got along with. It was always busy everyday so it made the days go by quickly. My managers all seemed to be on the same sheet of music and ran the business exceptionally well. Like any other retail job, you had angry customers who would make the job a little more challenging...but you also had some really fun customers to interact with. I would recommend this job to anyone who is interested in a fast paced, fun environment."
good,It's a great place to work due to hiring above minimum wage. They hire within so there's lot of room for advancement. The benefits are better than some companies and they do a lot for the community to get the employees involved.
good,Best Buy is a really good company for anyone interested in working for retail and various aspects of the retail industry. once you are thorough with it just take the next step by moving on to different organizations. You never know when there is going to be a restructuring and closing of business.
good,i liked working at best buy the only reason i left was because i got a better opportunity to make more money. I would have loved to stay if they offered me a managerial position with more money. I would probably go back today if they offered me the same.
good,"ambiente laboral muy profesional y estable."
good,"Originally, I started as a Computer Sales Associate and took online training courses with belief that I was to shadow another associate during the day. I was never actually able to shadow anyone and instead was thrown head first into oceans of customers. It was pretty nerve racking and stressful, but the more I taught myself on how to interact with the customer and how to sale product i became more efficient. Otherwise the store itself and the community was amazing. One of the best experiences I've had at a job."
good,"The company has done nothing but motivate me to do and be better. It has a family feel, while also pushing for some healthy competition! Great place to develop and be developed as a person and a leader in any organization."
good,The work environment was very exciting due to the fact that there was constantly new technology coming out that we had to learn about.
good,"Best Buy, allowed me to extend my knowledge on electronics as well as provided me with great customer service experience training. I got the opportunity to work with great people as well as meet people. I loved the benefits of working for this company"
good,"Great, fun place to work.  Coworkers are great and very helpful. Managers work with you, and do everything they can to help you.  The company would often provide free lunches, or host company bowling parties or event outings.  We would have contests and raffles, winning prizes.  We would be recognized frequently for our hard work, and would win awards."
good,"Fast paced fun environment.  There are lot of career paths from sales, inventory to various areas in Management.  Perfect for those in school needing a part-time job with flexible hours, but also has full-time position for those desiring a long term career.  You can advance if you work hard."
good,This is a great place to work for. Everyone is truly happy to come to work everyday. The only downside is that they only staff a few people to full time employment. Most associates don't give up those positions.
good,Very employee centered. Fun environment and friendly people. Nice incentives. Good place with opportunities for development.
good,Great place to contract in a high-energy environment with a fun team. Hiring managers and HR Business Partners are also great to work with. Only wish they needed me for a longer duration!
good,"Very customer oriented, Best Buy likes to make sure that every single customer is engaged in a timely manner in case they are i need of anything that a sales associate may be able to assist them with. Also as well as stocking product on to shelves to make sure the customer can always see what it is that they are taking home and not just a display."
good,"""Having fun while being the best"""
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The atmosphere is amazing. You always around ""fun"", The only downside is the lack of pay. I love the job but it is not a job I would like to call a career"
good,"There was always work to be done, between customers and store duties. We were given 15-30 minute lunch breaks. I learned communication skill because we were always talking to people whether it was on the phone or with customers or with other employees. I learned how to work with various computer programs. We were required to memorize and explain multiple phone services and plans as well as the pros and cons to distinct cell phones. We had to know about as much product in the store as we could. I learned how to organize the store and make sure that it looked presentable. The hardest part of the job for me personally was the holidays because we had so many hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the environment that was there, it was just a fun place to be."
good,Best Buy has an atmosphere anyone can enjoy! Co-workers are a pleasure to work with and management is very well engaged with their employees.
good,"Great place to move up and learn about management. The company practices sound management practices, and has been around in a volatile industry for a long time. Retail electronics is a tough industry, but Best Buy continues to innovate to change with the times. Management and co-workers are great, I really enjoyed my time with Best Buy. Wouldn't change a thing (everyone wishes they got paid a little more)."
good,Un buen trabajo con beneficios y buen ambiente. Uno puede obtener promoción fácilmente y ganar aumentos.
good,IT's a great place to learn about new things. and with sales people like us it show you how much we know about our product. so you can get the best experience with the thing you want and for the best price.
good,"Learned amazing selling skills, business accumen, and about current technologies out there. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to develop my team into the best sales people on the planet and celebrate their progress. The schedule is not for everyone, though it is pretty flexible be prepared to work nights, weekends, and holidays."
good,"On a typical day I usually work directly with customers, and coach a team of salesmen. I also handle customer issues, such as complaints, and wrong orders. I learned how to be a better leader and how to manage a larger budget than I was accustom to. The hardest part of my job is inspiring people who don't really want to be there. I learned that if you genuinely learn about the individual, you could explain how the job can actually benefit them.The most enjoyable part of the job is the privilege to interact with so many people on a daily basis. I also love teaching others everything I know from a leader stand point, as well as a co-worker."
good,"Would love for the leadership to not be so uptight. After all, our motto is 'having fun while being the best', where's the fun?"
good,"Working at Best Buy as a Merchandiser is very task oriented.  Everyday there is a task to do, and while it seems repetitive, it's actually quite easy  My coworkers are fun to be around, and the management is helpful.  The computer based training is a waste of time in my opinion, and very uninteresting and dry."
good,"Best Buy is a company that pulled itself out of a downward trend by refocusing on its people and customers. They value their employees, and they value integrity and fairness in the workplace.  I enjoy working there, and I've made friends of coworkers that will remain after our employment with the company has ended."
good,Nice people to work for as well as the company jus wish their were more room for growth. You get to meet a lot of people and get to have fun doing it too.
good,A typical day at work was pretty fast paced. You have to remain productive in order to satisfy staff and customers. I learned a lot and the schedule was very flexible. Management was great but could be better communicators. Over all Best buy was great.
good,"This is my first and only job since graduating college and I couldn't be happier with where TQL has taken my career. To be blunt, the LAE position here is not one to be taken lightly. If you're willing to commit yourself to the job and put in the time and effort it requires then there really are no limits to your future (both in compensation and career advancement). TQL"
good,Like all retail jobs it can be stressful. This company was my first customer service experience. I didn't  learn what i wanted to learn from this company. But i did have a great management team and co-workers.
good,"I would come in at 9:00 and Best Buy workers would be listing to music, and having a good time before we opened our doors. I loved how fun they were and how smart they were."
good,"Typical day working at best buy is a fusion of repetitive activity with a twist of character interaction. The amount one interacts with on a daily basis in the store is very nice to see. Interacting from with people from around the world teaches you to be culturally sensitive and keep an open mind on how to interact with others. Management does an exceptional job at making employees feel as equals and the level of mutual respect is always present. However, co-workers on the other hand isn't as communal. There are employees who only look out for themselves and there are those who genuinely enjoy helping other who either don't understand or need assistance explaining something to a customer like myself. There is never any gain from a customer walking out of a store unsatisfied, and an employee feeling like a failure in the work area. The most difficult aspect of the job is the excessive need to make sure all goals as a team are being met. Since there's no real sense of unity in certain departments, it becomes difficult to work as a unit. The best aspect of the job is being surrounded by the few people who actually care for one another, the feeling of completely satisfying consumer desires, and being surrounded by technology and being able to completely simplify even the most complex features, details, and specifications to an person I can interact with."
good,I enjoyed my time working with Best Buy. I learned a ton a and got to meet new people. Management was sometimes behind and it was very one sided when it came to moving up in the company.
good,"A typical day at work would involve a plethora of clients with different technical problems. You would then be faced with the challenge to rapidly diagnose the problem and try to provide client with a ""quick fix"" while selling company brand support services. If attempt of quick fix does not go as planned, then you are faced with applying prior knowledge if IT along with company brand software to provide a fixed product for client. Management is very supportive, and if needed works directly with you. Coworkers are all supportive because you are surrounded by a team-based environment, and there is no hard part of the job if you follow protocol and know what you're doing. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you've provided the client with a newly restored product and seeing a smile on there face as you provide them with a farewell statement."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"nice place to work, "
good,"Loved working at Best Buy, everyone in the company had a passion for learning the business. Every day was something new that I learned, not a dull moment at work, I always had fun."
good,"Its an excellent work environment with great concept of team building. Every morning the whole staff will get together and have a team meeting also recognizing personal individual achievements with your peers. Every sales associate will have their departments Daily Task List (DTL) and you will responsible for specific jobs that day and in order to accomplish these task you must get your supervisor to initial the DTL providing that you have completed all the task you were assigned. Normally, I was the supervisor or even a senior in the department so I would be responsible to delegate jobs for the staff and sign off on it for them once they completed their DTL for the day. Management was great especially for individuals wanting a bigger role or more responsibility they were very helpful and supportive. Also working with your peers you gain a new appreciation for one another and your relationships usually progress from work peers to actual friendships. The hardest part would have to be the job security unfortunately, with the advancement of online shopping and whole companies expanding job positions are no longer secure and the company begins cutting job titles and taking positions away demoting individuals or even just letting them go. The most enjoyable part must be learning about all the new technological devices coming out receiving praise over your product knowledge from customers and the amazing employee discount which I truly miss."
good,"I enjoyed diagnosing and doing minor repairs on PCs, tablets, laptops, and cell phones. I made a lot of good friends working here, it really felt like a family."
good,Company always makes sure employees are knowledgeable as far as new products and services. I learned that communication is very important especially when trying to get and keep the team on the same page.
good,"this is a great place to work at."
good,A typical day at work included setting up all electronics before customers arrived and when they arrived provided them with the best customer service and assistance to ensure they left with the right items or were given all the help I could provide. My co-workers were always positive and willing to help in satisfying customers. The hardest part of working at best Buy was gaining the knowledge in the specifics of my department in order to provide the proper service and correct information. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the relaxed and friendly environment along with the store meetings that kept the entire business engaged in what we believed most important to bring success to the industry.
good,"TYPICAL DAY"
good,"It is a very fun place to work although sometimes it's too laid back.Some co-workers take advantage of that, but the GM will do every job top to bottom to make sure work gets done."
good,I would sell mainly media items such as game systems dvds cds stereos and all the accessories.  I learned more about the systems and stereos then I ever thought I would.  Most of the management was fun.  My co-workers are what I miss most about the job they were always fun.  The hardest part was dealing with the troublesome customers or when I caught kids stealing.  The most enjoyable part was the co-workers
good,great work environment a great place to improve verbal and technical skills
good,Best Buy enhanced my customer service skills and Geek Squad provided me with technological knowledge and skills.
good,Great place to work when in college but in high school you’re forced to work late hours so your school gpa goes down.
good,"Working in Best Buy can be a great experience for those trying to find flexibility in their life as well as school although winter holiday hours can be pretty bad even for part timers. Management is respectable and professional the majority of the time. It will be very busy most of the time and there will usually always be  a customer looking to buy something so working here is no walk in the park but every once in a while it can be pretty laid back if there aren't any customers and all your duties are complete for your department. Lunches are pretty standard, 30 min for every 6 hours, it is mandatory though which seems unfair to those who don't want to take break, i understand there is a law that says we're suppose to get a lunch but it doesn't mean we have to take it, but that is a legal issue that i'm not 100 percent sure about. The co-workers are easy to get along with and its very easy to start befriending a lot of the team. I learned a lot from working in Best Buy and i thank them for the experience and skills i learned from my time there."
good,"fun working environment."
good,I enjoyed my time at Best Buy.  I got a chance to learn about so many different things in the technology world and management was very approachable.  The employees were great to work with and easy to get along with as well.  The hardest part about the job was learning everything in the store because there are so many technological products out there and people expect to you know about them all as a Best Buy employee.  The most enjoyable part of my job was playing with all the cool gadgets to find cool and relatable benefits to appeal to the customer.
good,"I love working here! I only work 5-8 hour, but the employees and managers are awesome! I've learned a lot working here from multitasking multiple customers to finding them the right product! The hardest part of my job (for me) is getting Revenue per-hour. When I started I was close to hitting the goal, but it keeps getting lifted! I haven't gotten full-time, so another job is currently needed!"
good,Open To Discuss At An Interview. Its A Very Friendly environment.
good,very good company to work for and many opportunities for advancement
good,Good company to work for. Co-workers really help you out especially if management isn't very good. Good benefits and employee discount.
good,"great benefits"
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for this company. It had great management, a team driven work environment, and a productive atmosphere. I learned a lot about sales and working with a team towards a goal. The hardest part of my job would have been standing for 8 hours at a time, and selling without making any commission. Unfortunatly the store I was working at had a very large amount of hours cut towards the end of my time there, and that is why I left the company."
good,A typical day at Best Buy would consist of extreme training on the latest technology. I have learned that technology changes daily. My co-workers would help each other out where the other lacked. The hardest part of the position was to stay up to date on all products in your department. Management was excellent on customer issue resolution. The most enjoyable part was testing the latest technology.
good,Best Buy was a good place to work if your good at sales. If you are good at sales you will thrive at Best Buy and will likely advance in the company.
good,"To be a Sales Consultant at Best Buy you are required to take countless hours of training via ELearning's and traditional trainings. The typical work day consists of clocking in, assisting customers non stop and clocking out. Like any other job there are great people to work with and...those people. The job can be very fun at times but your Managers will annoy you nonstop. Your expected to meet a crazy goal of sales numbers (for me its $601 an hour) with no compensation. Its not fun making a company almost $100,000 a month and only be making far less than $1,000. Even when you meet your sales expections your managers still bug you about making numbers go higher. At a certain point you realize they only care about numbers and not the employee. The hardest part of the job is remaining patient when it comes to ignorant customer, know it all customers, and the total BS of Managers. The best part of the job is the discount.....just too bad you wont be making enough to buy anything of worth,"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of managing a highly motivated sales team to meet sales goals, gain new clients, keep up to date with past and current technology, and have fun while being the best. Ive learned a lot about my personal journey both personally and professionally over the past few years. Management was very supportive of my leadership style and was always willing to provide feedback. The hardest part of the job was often to paint a picture for a current client on why the latest and greatest devices were the thing to have and how they can seamlessly integrate with each other and overall make the persons life easier. It was hard at times because most people already have working devices that are not that old and there mindset is wait until the old one breaks. Overall the most enjoyable part was the atmosphere and the people i was was able to surround myself with as well as the clients I've been able to stay close with and now consider friends."
good,"My role is this company was to be myself, and take care of whom ever stepped into the building as if they were my family. I would utilize Best Buys promises to drive the best experience each individual wanted. I learned from many sources and was also relied on to assist and train new employees on the value of giving the best. I took it upon my self to maximize my success from what my peers showed me, so that I would always have a way to resolve the unknown. I have been against the wall with clients upset and or yelling, as a leader I took it upon myself to apologize for the issues that were created and generated return cliental with the Best Buy promises. I have had outstanding management walk me through "" A day in the life of a leader"", to better prepare me for unknowns that the company encounters. The best thing I learned is to not allow myself to become stressful for regardless of the hours, I was thought to control what I can. I used this life lesson to finish all that I started so each day will be anew opposed to playing catch up with my own work. I am blessed each day I enter the building for I ultimately enjoy helping family's, as well as making the work environment fun for my fellow peers."
good,"I have worked for this company for around six years and I love being apart of the Geek Squad culture. Geek Squad is not just a computer repair business, we are something much larger.

I got to do exactly what I love to do here, and that is work on computers, better myself, and give an awesome name for the company."

good,"The people were amazing best bunch of coworkers ever, management is very encouraging and supportive. The pay is good for someone working their way through school no much more."
good,"Best Buy is a place where you make friends quickly as well as have fun selling. Considering the amount of selling that is actually done, Best Buy is not on commission. The company offers impressive employee discounts and they are flexible with ones hours especially if working part time."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Worked the sales floor in the PC, Home and Office department. Had a chance to assist customers on software installation, networking connections and device setups."
good,I worked there for over 7 and a half years and  while it had its down times as far as moral and what have you goes. It was not a bad place to work. I was fortunate enough to sell things that I enjoyed. had a good work relationship with many coworkers and what have you.

good,"It was a very comfortable environment to work in, and everyone worked as a team! Very positive environment and great place for employment!"
good,Best buy is great place to work. Prior to working there you have to take an aptitude test not only to test your skills but your personality. That means you are going to love everyone you work with. The company offers a ton of training to help you in and out side of the store. Whether you are full time or part time  you have to options for health care and 401k benefits. Depending on that department or position you are in the typical day will differ. No matter what position you are in you will have to deal with customers and offer first class customer service. This is one of the few places where they will put the customer first 100% of the time. The employees that work there honestly want to help the customers and make sure they get the most of their time with a skilled professional when it comes to technology.
good,"Assigned work to repair. Went through a lot of managers for the service technicians. Enjoyed the work, and learning a lot about repair. Had to learn to work with some of the employees. Enjoyed most of the tech's and their willingness to share their knowledge."
good,"A typical day at work was never the same. I would train employess, write and deliver reviews, go over numbers, and other various tasks to complete my job. I learned how to manage a team of multiple people, just under twenty individuals, and be very time managed. My co-workers helped me gain knowledge and ensure that every step we took was the right one for us. The hardest part of my job was having a plan for the day and that being thrown out the window because of anything, but I didn't mind it at all. I enjoyed coming to work with new challenges and use my skills to help others."
good,"there are really no complaints from me about best buy. when i walk in the door after i got my blue shirt i knew exactaly what i needed to do even before i get there. the training period could go on for months if you're a slow learner, but if you can pick up what they teach you pretty quick, then your training time can cut short. the management really cares about you unlike anywhere else i've been. if there's a problem where they can help they can advide you how to fix and also check up on you to make sure its alright. you can almost say its like a parent/child relationship or big brother/sister relationship.i've learned how to manage my time and even picked up some aditional info about whats around me on a daily basis. i really enjoyed the company picnics,movie, and game nights they host. and the only thing that was hard to me was the holidays where business picks up dramatically. i recommend this place to anyone who can get the chops for working here."
good,"I really enjoyed working here it was very fun, however alot of your good hard work usually goes un-noticed. Alot of employees fight for promotions which makes the work environment sketchy at times. However overall hery good place to work."
good,Best buy has been a great place to work over the past 6 1/2 years.  I would not be looking for a change but the company is cutting jobs for the third time since I have been here so I no longer feel like I have job sercurity.
good,"Geek Squad is a great place to work and learn skills such as customer relations, administrative responsibilities and vendor relations. It is also a very secure company to work for and their benefits are absolutely amazing. The environment there is such that everyone gets along with each other and working there for as long as I have, they have become somewhat of a second family."
good,"Dealing with clients upfront; trouble shooting their home or business notebooks or station desktops. Always being outside of a store, setting up client’s devices such as TV, receiver, blu-ray player and other mobile devices such as iphone or ipad to their network. Running wire such as speaker, coax, CAT5 and HDMI cables. Also making the cabling at hand such as CAT5, speaker wire and coaxial cables. Setting up wireless printers and drivers to clients business or personal computer, and demonstrating the work that was performed at hand. "
good,"A typical work day  I activate phones and interact with customers all day.I learned how to help a customer find what they need.Management is great and communicates with their employees very well.At Best Buy we kind of have a family environment between the co workers.Hardest part of my job is explaining an elderly person how to use a smartphone, but this also what I love about my job. The best part of my job is showing people that the product i brought them will actually do what they want it to do and more. I also like Best Buy because they give me a product that i can believe in when I sell it"
good,"Had a great time working there, the team was very diverse and entertaining. The expectations were high so it made reaching goals challenging but obtainable."
good,"This is a fantastic job overall. A typical day consist of talking with multiple different people everyday and doing daily task around the store, such as keeping up with price tags. This job has taught me a lot about how to use my problem solving skills and most the time i'm on my own helping customers. I learned about new technology but I also learned how to read people and their body language better. My management team is extremely helpful, no matter if its accommodating a schedule or closing a sale. My co-workers are the most friendliest group of people I have ever had the pleasure of working with and always are hard working when it gets busy! The hardest part about my job honestly is when there is a bad customer, and by that I mean a customer who harasses you and gives you a hard time. However, on the flip side, the most enjoyable part is having a good conversation with a customer and dealing with all the pleasant people I come across."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best Buy is a very fun and upbeat place to work.  The training you receive will help you with your future career endeavours.
good,Best Buy is definitely a fast-paced and demanding job. While in the Mobile Department we have to read weekly notes describing sales for cellular providers and the prices of each individual phone for the week and what to expect if a customer asks about pricing. We help customers choose post-paid and pre-paid plans and devices for what best suits the customers needs and lifestyle. We do general technical support with information we have gathered whilst working and information given to us by cellular phone provider representatives. Management is excellent even if the manager is brand new at doing the job. The manager makes us much more efficient and organized. Co-workers are great and friendly. Could be more helpful when helping train new employees instead of complaining that they are taking hours away from them. Definitely can have better attitudes about job functions. The hardest part of the job is to make sure that customers have their phones and cell phone plans correct and giving them the personalized attention they require. The most enjoyable would be interacting with customers and providing the excellent customer service that the store and each employee personally puts out and always shows. The work environment that the management team puts off and we feed off of is absolutely perfect. It creates energy and positivity in the store and I applaud the management team for doing so. The general manager is an excellent store manager and he deserved his job that he has. The department managers are excellent and provide excellent management and supervisory skills among the entire
good,"In a typical day I would ring up customer purchases, handle cash and credit card transactions. I learned how to handle customer complaints to ensure their satisfaction so they may come back. I really enjoyed my co-workers. The most enjoyable part was satisfying the cuatomers."
good,"The day is usually filled with tasking including merchandising: making sure product is out, pricing it correctly, as well as cleaning. Sales are also implied due to the fact that customers come first. The people that I work with sometimes make the day easier, but sometimes more difficult. One of the things I try to do is to coach and train employees so the day runs smoother and so that they from now on know the information needed to exceed their personal goals."
good,"I typically spend my day ""behind the curtain"" repairing client's computers while keeping those clients informed throughout the repair process. I also answer incoming phone calls and manage shipping and receiving tasks for client repairs. The most enjoyable parts of my job include my team, the opportunity to solve computer problems and resolving tough client situations."
good,Great store to work for if you are into technology and love to work with people in a social environment.

good,"A day at work for me is providing excellent customer service skill, industry expertise and patience. Each day someone wants to purchase a new computer for what ever reason they have. It is my job to find out more about the end user in order to match them with a great computer they will get the most out of. My knowledge of Windows 8, Intel processors versus AMD processors, Apple versus Microsoft products, Memory, Hard drives, Home networks, Gaming, Hot spots, streaming and everything technoogy related that I have not mentioned, must be efficient. This opportunity keeps me informed on the latest and greatest technology at all times. Its like a Geek in heaven. Those are the reasons I love my job."

good,"Best Buy is a very friendly and support giving job in which,"
good,"My typical day at Best Buy would start with turning on the phones and running my morning reports. Then I start checking off what items we have available for pick up and which ones we are missing, while helping customers with store pick ups and answering the phones and answering the customer questions on the phone. If we are slow and customer service is busy I will step over and help with returns while answering phone calls and selling product over the phone. At the end of my shift I have to write a report of everything I have sold through out the day and compare that to the daily budget and send those numbers to my managers."
good,"Loved working for this company left to explore other things, however would go back to this company for sure. Pay very well for what the expected out of you and always tried to promote from within and help you progress professionally."

good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best Buy was my first job and as such I learned so much from it. They held their employees to a very high standard of customer service and professionalism. We were also required to have a lot of product knowledge and they took measures to ensure that we knew what we were talking about. This involved online learning quizzes and Saturday morning meetings. They focused on teaching us anything we needed to know to be better at our jobs. The managers were always critiquing and informing us on ways to improve and asking us how we think we could do better. It was a very positive experience and I am so glad that I got to work there and I wouldn't hesitate to do so again in the future
good,Great company that seemed to really care about their employees. The job was enjoyable almost everyday. My position allowed me to manage my own schedule. The management team was very involved and took me under their wings to make sure I had a solid career path. 
good,"A typical day at work begins with knowing our goals for the day. We make sure we know what is expected of us for the day and we begin not contacting customers but engaging in conversation with them to help understand what it is they need and want. I learned that the more questions you ask the easier it is to identify what they need, and when you find the perfect solution, the result is a happy customer and in return they become loyal and everyday customers. The environment at work is astonishing for a first job, my co-workers feel like family because we see each other everyday and my managers are like coaches. What makes me enjoy my day is when i can set up a customer with a device to make their everyday life more enjoyable, and they walk out with a smile on their face. My job is all around enjoyable and there is not much that makes it difficult for me to perform well. If there was something hard about my job, the hardest thing is to leave the building without a smile."
good,"My typical day consisted of asking customers if help or expertise was needed. I also inspected home audio equipment and theater systems. My day also included installing and learning new equipment."

good,"A typical day at Best Buy includes interacting one on one with customers and identifing their shopping needs and helping to fulfill them as best as we can."
good,"At Best Buy I would interact with customers regarding cellular devices and their corresponding plans.  I gleaned a good deal of information about business needs and how to activate phones through many different computer systems.  The management team and my co-workers were wonderful to work with, and were always willing to help out when needed.  The hardest part of this job, other than Black Friday, would be when the activation systems went down and we were not able to activate devices.  I most enjoyed when new devices would come out, and being able to learn new things about them and playing with them."
good,"A typical day at work involved building rapor with your customers to best address their needs, finding out what they need, and ringing them out. This job was by far one of my most enjoyable jobs I've ever had; it was always high energy and a great environment. "

good,"Working for Best Buy is a wonderful experence. it is a great job to work at and i enjoy working with the staff and mangers, as well as the customers.

good,typical retail store
good,Was in charge of the customer service desk. I answered phones and transferred to the correct department or I helped customers on the phone by answering their questions. I was in charge as Manager on Duty and was responsible for closing the store with the general manager. I learned to be an active listener when is came to customer service and enjoyed being independent in help the customer's with their needs.
good,Assist customers with sales and services. I learned how to manage people and prioritize daily activities on a day to day basis.

good,"Best Buy is a very loyal company to it's customers. The day-to-day interactions between customers and employers is exceptional. One great thing I love about being a part of this team is we live by the motto: ""No Customer Goes Un-Served, No Employee Goes Un-Trained"". There is constant ""coaching"" on the sales floor that helps us improve our customer experience."
good,I would go into work around 8 pm and then i would help the sales associates organize the store.. i would later then go to our storage room and receive inventory then i would input it into the computer. Afterwards i would go and put all the items i have received into there appropriate categories then go restock the store with the items.

good,The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people and having the chance to work in a partnership.
good,"I was chosen as a performance manager as I showed that I could get a store team to increased sales and profits and then did so in six stores in four states by teaching the advantages of teamwork, Communication, Customer Service, Inventory Control, Planning, Loss Prevention and Training. These methods were later used by all Store Managers."

good,"It’s a good company to work for, very family friendly and a fun work environment I would highly recommend applying for them especially if you love electronics"
good,Extremely fun place to be with a lot to learn. Several departments to go into and lots of opportunities to show how diverse your knowledge in technology can be.
good,"I worked at the Best Buy Mobile in Ames for almost 3 years and loved every minute of it. We were a true team and our leadership supported us 100% If i could change one thing, it would be being paid more for competitive sales. You cant survive on $15 an hour full time. Otherwise a great place to work!"
good,"Pretty good company to work with. Overall great environment. The people that work at Best Buy can be great and have the same interests as you if you are into gaming, technology, etc. Discounts aren’t that bad."

good,"Fast paced setting with a lot of regular customers as well as new faces."
good,"My overall experience with Best Buy was great.  I began my career with Best Buy in West Little Rock as the supervisor of the computer apartment which consisted of music, computer hardware and software printers and cell phones. As a department we rank high in the region each quarter for sale and revenue."
good,"Great opportunity to delvelop leadership skill. The company's culture revolves around their core values. So values based leadership is what they preach and practise. In the process you become an expert in people management. In my opinion, as a strong leader, one of the core skill set that everyone must have is an ability to influence others in a positive way. I felt, i had opportunities to learn and practise the same throughout the time i spent in Best Buy. When majority of the people around you feel the same, the learning you share from each other is exponential. Thats a skill, thats hardly explained in a resume."
good,"GeekSquad is perfect for IT workers just getting started in their field. Typical day means going in and handling client issues, updating ticket system, troubleshooting devices and virus removals. "

good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,A typical day at work was basically me helping customers around the store. I was stationed at video games and stereos but was also able to help in other places as well like theater and computers. The hardest part was probably just having to work with customers that have advance problems .The store is really big and has multiple items in every aspect that has to do with technology so a lot of customers have problems that aren't in my field but thankfully departments like Geek squad are there to help. most enjoyable part was watching people walk out happy with their product .
good,"Fun, good discounts in certain things, great management, mandatory to work on Black Friday but they did provide food."
good,"Most days are straightforward but the occasional challenge helps keep you on your toes. The workplace culture is fantastic, although this is very dependent on each store's management. Hardest part of the job is dealing with lazy or incompetent co-workers."
good,"Cuando trabaje ahí el ambiente laboral fue muy bueno, mi jefa directa era muy atenta y compresiva"
good,"Best Buy encourages its employees to be as well trained as possible. There are always learning modules available to do on break. Each member of management is responsible for their own area, but will work with any employee to resolve any issues found.The employees often form lasting friendships and there is rarely and internal conflict. The only difficult thing is that there is often not enough team members in each department to address every customer consistently."
good,A competive job lots to do everyday.love all the benefits  .there are lots  of pros verse cons . Love how it’s super busy during the holidays . I learned a lot of stuff there .
good,"having fun while being the best,I learend to help every single customer with dignity,great management team very supportive team, great work culture environement,the hardest part of my job is to confront the shoplifter,seenig the customer leave to the store with  great feedback and smile ."
good,"great place to start a career, good pay, awesome discount and benefits. teaches financial, sales, customer service. training was industry leading. good job for college/highschool student."
good,There is tons of room for improvement there only if you perform well. Management is fantastic. Sales goals are unreasonable for the foot traffic and the low income area.
good,"Management is always the best, but it really depends on the store location. Some only care about the numbers you provide to help the store reach their daily revenue goal. so if you don’t show up on time often, or you’re always calling out; but you can provide great numbers when you are there, you’re safe. "
good,"Overall fun and easy job. Generally assisting customers with education on their devices, as well as troubleshooting issues. Checking in devices for repair agent to fix. Manager was awesome. Everyone got along well, great camaraderie. Pay was good per hour, but don’t expect many hours. That’s the downside."
good,They treat you like family from the start. They are always happy and if you need help you can ask no problem. Everyone is a real friend. If I could I would work there again.
good,"I loved working in operations, was the last line of defense before the customer left the store making sure they had everything need and made sure it was great experience."
good,"The management team did a phenomenal job with the motivation of not only myself but the team as well. Working in a stand-alone shop, the attitude towards going to work was always positive."
good,"Being new to Canada, it was very important for me to learn about the work culture in Canada. Learn how to communicate with people and be comfortable with the Canadian Culture. Best Buy provided me wit that opportunity and i am learning new things everyday, adapting myself to Canada."
good,The coworkers are amazing! Very helpful and friendly. The only thing I didn't like is the lack of training in the equipments. going over it one time doesn't mean someone understands.
good,"Working in the warehouse environment was the first for me, however being in the office environment was familiar to me. The clerical support from others was always open and helpful."
good,"Best Buy Canada has amazing people and amazing values. The company has great programs to help you grow both professionally and personally. Facilities at Canadian Head Quarters are plenty. They have a gym (24x7); cafeteria has deli, grill, chef’s special and salad bar, cheaper postal option, dry cleaning service and many more. The growth opportunities are numerous, given that there are so many departments in the company, there is no hinderance to growth. Initial pay is less, but as you show your skill set, tremendous opportunities await. Overall, a fantastic organization to work for."
good,"Best Buy is a fun, productive place to work. They give you the tools and resources to succeed. The management was the best I've ever experienced, and I would definitely go back to work for them."
good,"They train you pretty well, and everyone there is super nice and helpful! Hours can be a bit of a struggle if you are looking for something like 20-30 hours. But otherwise, its great!"
good,"Best Buy is a great company to work for. A typical day at work is smooth. I learned about technology. The management was great. The hardest part of the job was making sure every customer was happy, but I got it done."
good,I was very happy working at BB even though I was there for a very short period but the team I worked with was genuinely well trained and the management team was knowledgeable enough to thrive the team and hit the daily target.  BB provided many resources and advance training tools to the employees at all level and that was for me very important.
good,"I worked at the Best Buy on the South Side."
good,"Best Buy has made my first time working in retail memorable. The entire team, including employees from different departments, are willing to cooperate with each other. The managers and supervisors get along well and try their best to ease a new hire into their new position. The job is simple and very easy to learn. The only part that isn't so great when applying for the position is having to complete approximately 6-8 hours of their online training. It's not difficult, but rather very dry material and I personally could have done without out."
good,Best buy was by far one of my favorite jobs. The benefits were great. The work experience was fun. I really enjoy working with people and fast  paced environments.
good,"Friendly environment, nice and creative people. Great support with training programs and skills improving. Management were part of the team and it was easy to work and easy to communicate with them."
good,"Es una empresa con buenas prestaciones y que piensan mucho en sus trabajadores, desgraciadamente el compañerismo confunde la vida personal con el trabajo."
good,Good job with lots of benefits. Everyone was always very friendly and supportive. Learned a lot from the superiors and was able to make lasting friendships
good,"So you show up to work and are given a assignment and you do it."
good,"From our incredible team that continued to strive to bring the absolute best service to our clientele, to our management providing the tools and resources to perform our tasks, this has been quite a fulfilling job. Geek Squad culture has pushed me to believe that with a common goal and the proper people around you is a great recipe for success!"
good,"Fun place to work, treat their employees well."
good,Nice work pace with alot to learn quickly.... Nice co-workers thats very helpful at any time also has a great management to motivate employers to the best of their ability.
good,El mejor ambiente en cuanto a cultura general capacitación etc.
good,"Good work environment, with friendly people and management. Good opportunities for growth and personal improvements."
good,"Working for them was a great work ethics and hands on job in the management side and how to be a successful sales person in my upcoming situations. Therefore, I was successful in other jobs that I did after moving away from the Abilene area."
good,Great work environment with awesome staff. Had good work/life balance. Helped students with tuition reimbursement. Earned PTO very easily with working 32 hours a week.
good,Its a comfortable job its easy once I'm showed what to do and how things are required to be done. I liked the security they have. I enjoyed working there and learning things I didn't know about.
good,"looking back my time at bestbuy taught me a lot of skills that were useful in future business dealings. money sense, margins, sales tactics and ideas were some - more importantly interpersonal skills."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Working there everyone was extremely friendly, and understanding. Wanting to learn, and working with you to improve yourself. My GM was horrible but everyone else were wonderful. Some clients would be difficult but after that it's not that bad"
good,"I really enjoy working there, everyday i learn something new. Management is great, they are flexible and will do everything to keep you happy. Workplace is clean and organized."
good,It was a fun place to work at just because at the time when DVDS were the hottest thing you could be the first one to know when the knew things came out and to purchase the movies and games. Not to mention all the cool new electronics that came out as well.
good,"customer service, finding product or finding a product to match their need, Geek Squad also taught me how to repair computers both software and hardware issues."
good,I love the job but when it is slow sometimes its hard to convince someone they need geek squad protection. I don't want to rely on someone else's purchase for my hours. Besides that this is the funnest job I have ever had I would keep it on the side for fun.
good,Best buy gave me good expereince to continue my journey into the business world. Working at this company provided me alot of knowledge and helped me form connections with my peers.
good,Best Buy was a great place to work.  Had the opportunity to work in many different facets of the consumer electronics industry and learn many different applicable business tactics.
good,A fun atmosphere and exciting products to sale. Best Buy is a performance based company. If you work hard and perform well you can create a good career for yourself.
good,"a typical day at best buy was someone buying the biggest item or having a lot of people in store. I've learned a lot about working in the store, you learn how to work as a  team with your coworkers, and you get used new stuff they brought in the store"
good,"Working at Best Buy was a good experience. At first we were only given about 3 and a half hour work days and then we had about 7-8 hours when Black Friday came around. Workplace culture was very good, overall everyone got along well with each other and there was a lot of teamwork involved with employees. Management were nice, fair, and overall strict about how they wanted things done. My only complaint was lack of communication. Other employees as well as myself were not contacted at all when we were let go, and when we contacted them to see if we still had jobs, they would not even answer."
good,"I feel like Best Buy is a great company to work for if you're a ""normal"" person. Starting pay is great for a retail job, and they treat their employees pretty well depending on what store you work for. However, if you're going through a hard time and it starts affecting your performance, it goes from yes we care about you to do your job or you're fired really quick. It's like that in a lot of jobs, but when your numbers are being counted, there often isn't much room to slack off. That can be stressful on top of whatever else you might be dealing with. That being said, I still enjoyed working here. The company as a whole is fantastic."
good,"Typical day as a member of the Merch team is pretty relaxed, especially if you are part-time. Benefits and employee discounts are great. You are offered more benefits if you are a full time employee."
good,"Fun competitive Customer service. I learned a lot about electronics even though i had knowledge prior to employment, learned a lot about devices I owned myself. Hardest part was leaving, truly enjoyed working there."
good,"Great place to work. Excellent entry level positions and really motivates growth within the company. The employed workers are nice and very helpful to customers, recommended for any."
good,"Motivating, developing and managing a team of members, ensuring a high level of product and service knowledge, professional appearance, demeanor, and attitude at all times thereby maintaining a superior level of customer shopping experience aligned with the predetermined company standards and objectives in mind."
good,"Very number intensive. Hitting sales when it's slow is the most tedious. Main concern for management. As for that, great working experience. Love dealing with technology and how it advances so quickly."
good,"-Fantastic manager, really up-lifting"
good,its a pretty good job the co workers are very helpful when you're first starting off always willing to help.the work load isn't anything crazy they train you for the most part on the tasks that you'll be expected to do
good,Working as a sales consultant at Best Buy will give you the opportunity to develop networking with customers and develop customer relationships and much more.
good,"It was a cool job and the management teams are fantastic. kind of culty at first but that fades after you earn ""blue shirt status"". mobile department is stressful but rewarding. not a good job if you are generally an impatient person or have trouble problem solving."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The customers were easy to work with and I was able to provide a proficient amount of help. The managers were willing to throughly explain given tasks at hand. I enjoyed working at Best Buy.
good,"The typical work day would consist of shipping and receiving inventory for the store. The cool thing about working in the back was that I got to mess and play with all the new technology before any one else. Working In the warehouse was the back bone of the store. We made sure that all inventory was accounted for. Not only did we stock the floor, but we had to make sure and count every high priced item in the truck to make sure that we where not missing anything, to insure an accurate inventory. The hardest park of the job was counting and documenting every little thing in the whole store.It was painstaking but at the end when everything came out, you would have a feeling of accomplishment."
good,Great place to work but can be a little bit stressful depending on your position.... This place is a family environment and the teach you everything that you need to know about the business. Awesome place to work especially if you are young and starting out . There is a lot of room for growth.. it is all up to the individual..
good,It's a great place to work if you love technology and the culture around it. It gives you a chance to learn far more about things than you ever would have otherwise.
good,"Working at best buy while in high school was strange for a person my age but I made due. I worked my way up from a cashier to a sales associate. Once I became that i helped produce a above positive revenue for departments such as gaming, Digital Imaging and Appliances."
good,"I love the culture there,   its a fun place to work at. Get to be with around the new technology that comes out. Management is good and understanding. Very good place to work, the training is very good."
good,"Decent work life balance at lower levels, compensation and benefits are wonderful, job is as secure as your work ethic, culture is fun and fast paced on high traffic days, management is supportive. Great place to work long as you like retail hours."
good,Working at Geek Squad has taught me many technical troubleshooting and repair skills that has helped become more productive and competitive in the Desktop Technician market.
good,"Fun place to be in, everyone was very helpful at all times. Every one was always in a good mood. Only setbacks were my hours after a certain amount of time, and that was a major issue to me"
good,"I was a seasonal worker at Best Buy and it was my first time working retail. They taught me mostly everything I need to know for the job and all my coworkers were quite friendly. I worked morning, evening, and every now and then some day shifts."
good,Best Buy is a great company to work for if you are looking for a retail job.  If you are full-time you get PTO and vacation days along with health and car insurance. Part-time and full-time employees both can get a 401k plan and an employee discount.
good,"I believe the Best Buy company tries very hard to keep its associates happy. It certainly fails sometimes, especially due to its fight against Amazon and other online retailers, but it has more ways to listen to employees than any company I know of. I have communicated directly with people from corporate over my area on several occasions and they have always received feedback well and even instituted some changes rather quickly."
good,I enjoyed the tech Support. Especially the MRI Disk. I love being physically ABLE to fix a machine and more than one at a time. Its therapeutic. Especially if you don't have phone calls to worry about or customers to be bothered with . Perfect for one with Asperger's like myself.
good,"Best buy as a whole is an amazing place to work at. Good pay for a starting job, amazing benefits, and awesome managers. I would recommend anyone who wants to work in tech retail, work for BB"
good,"When I started working there, the management team were very informative and supportive throughout my whole training process. I learned a lot from selling skills, product knowledge, and being able to address customer concerns and also providing them with knowledge of what products are the best fit for them."
good,"Loved working for this company, just not enough to live on. Great management. The discount is especially fantastic as it was probably the most competitive in the industry."
good,"I love my job. My main issue is with my fellow employees. The discount is pretty good; it varies depending on the product. The company is pretty laid back and the work is fairly simple. As long as everybody on the team does their part, it is a really good job."
good,Best Buy is a great company to work for.  A lot of Best Buy's leadership staff is hired from within.  It helps when leaders understand the company thoroughly in order to assist associates in the battlefields.  The workplace culture of Best Buy is overall positive.  It's exciting to work in a team based environment where everyone is there to help.  The hardest part about working at Best Buy is probably being required to work weekends and holidays... as those are the times shoppers usually want to shop.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the friends I made while working with this company.
good,"Good place to work, easy to get to used to the products. Plenty of training to help you grow within Best Buy. Pay was fair and based off of work."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"When I moved from my job in fast food over to Best Buy, I found that it provided a greater sense of team work and work ethic. Many of the team members of Best Buy really work to help each other. As a result, I've found it a great place to really get started in advancing my knowledge and understanding of technology. If there was something I didn't know or was unfamiliar with, somebody at Best Buy would most likely have the answer I was looking for."
good,It has ups and downs but i just hate that you dont have a set schedule. You may know what time you come in but you never kno what time you get off. Other than that its really a great company
good,"This is a great place to work for not only younger individuals, but those who might be older with a good work ethic looking for a career that can last!"
good,Really good place to work at. A great entry level job where there's a lot of opportunities to grow within the company. The company focuses on employee satisfaction as well as customer satisfaction.
good,i guess the only problem that I have with the company is that they don't pay their existing employees fairly in comparison to the new employees that they hire.
good,It's a fun place to work but sometime the managers can be at your throats forcing you to sell more even if you're doing really well for the month. I would recommend it
good,"A day as a Best Buy/Geek Squad employee is never disappointing. There's always some technology to learn about coming out, and the customers are typically enjoyable to engage in. The company does typically like to promote from within."
good,My typical work day is busy and customer base is quite loaded. I learned great communication and sales skills. My store manager does a great job with holding store meetings and one on one. The workplace culture is diverse and friendly. (We have a lot of fun). The hardest place about my job is keeping up with all of the Best Buy promotion as well as promotion for multiple post paid and pre paid carriers.
good,Worked as a part time sales rep for almost 3 years. Also went to school and they worked well with my schedule. Best Buy also gives an amazing employee discount among other benefits. Great people to work with.
good,I enjoyed working for Best Buy. I had the opportunity to work with a phenomenal group of people. I enjoyed meeting different customer and being able to assist them with any problems they may have encountered.
good,"Best Buy is a great company to work for, especially for students. The opportunities you receive here can help you in the type of job that you would like to pursue in the future."
good,"Fun place to work, easy to get along with managers. I feel my wishes are respected. I love working for best buy, the discounts are amazing on most things and GSP is cheap and services are free."
good,"Best Buy is a fun and positive workplace where employees are acknowledged for excelling at their jobs. However, there is no commission unfortunately for the Sales Consultants."
good,"The Merch job in particular is almost a relaxing way to start my day, any thing that is concidered ""stressful"" is cake compaired to any job I have ever had."
good,"All kinds of cool work culture, Lots of benefits like health, dental, vison, Paid holidays, paid vacation, Full time only for most benefits tho. Otherwise a lot of fun."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work. The management is great and everybody works as a team. Also everyone is always so upbeat and even on a persons bad day, its still a good day. Its what you make out of the job and if you really enjoy it."
good,"This place is a great place to work. The people are great, the managers are professional and compassionate and treat their employees with respect. the only issue that I had was that I felt the company doesn't pay enough for what the job is. They offer low pay with no commission but yet they hold you to a sales quota as if you did. I feel that if you are going to pay a low wage then offer commission if not then pay a higher more exceptable  hourly wage."
good,A typical day at work including engaging with customers to sell products Best Buy had to offer. I learned how to properly close deals and remain professional. The hardest part of the job was managing multiple client at once but also this was the most enjoyable part since it taught me how to manage myself and remain calm under pressure.
good,Working at Best Buy has been a good opportunity. You get to learn a lot about different products and it also teaches you a lot about customer service and satisfaction. The work environment is fun team oriented.
good,Management cares about you and you career advancement. Easy to move up within the company if you have a desire too. Hard to get used tot he hours of retail- working all weekends and holidays.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Arrived for shift and assisted customers immediately. I learned valuable social and problem solving skills. I enjoyed helping customers be confident in their purchase. Management was driven for success. Overall a positive experience and a great place to work.
good,"Best Buy was my second job and it was a great one,I really appreciated the manager I had. I was given a chance even though I had not had much retail experience. However, I would recommend if someone does not want too much pressure, apply to a Best Buy Mobile."
good,"I can only use my memory now to remember what life was like when I was a salesman there. And it was great! Now it may not be fair to ask me now (after my world and life have changed). They are still fair. I can't really complain, I've only worked part time. been there a couple of years."
good,Nice place to work. Great manager and work life. The mall is busy time files. There is room for advancement just may take time.
good,"A typical day at Best-buy is me greeting the customer, directing customers to a sales person. I'm also looking for thieves. Management is great.  The hardest part about my job is standing for 8 hours."
good,"Your coworkers are quite enjoyable as well as the general manager. They do their best to make you feel like family. However, hours are slightly difficult to come by."
good,"Dealing with customer inquires about certain products."
good,"The culture for this job is great. The values for the employees and the customer promises should be a basis for all retail jobs. The pay, unfortunately, is not enough to compensate working at an electronic boutique store. The discount is great, but the discount does not pay living expenses. However, if you get a management position, it should be enough to compensate, but that's the only position."
good,"Everything was great, great coworkers, management was nice. the hardest part of my job was having to meet the quota of sales numbers. the only real complaint is that the scheduling system seemed to mess up a lot and leave the store under staffed sometimes."
good,I worked for best buy for a little over a year. The staff was friendly and my managers were great! Hours are great and flexible and they give you a lot of opportunities to advance your knowledge in your given department with quick and easy quizzes.
good,"Everything about this particular Best Buy is remarkable. The only real issue is their inability to distribute hours. In practically every department they are overstaffed and it really cuts down the ability to give hours to people who need them/want them. Despite that the management is flexible and understandable, co-workers are great, benefits are very impressive and you practically never see anyone complaining about the company at whole"
good,"I loved working at best buy, I got promoted in less the 5 months. people were very friendly. management was great some of them I didn't really agree with but overall great place."
good,"Once you become a Best Buy employee, the whole team takes you in as family member and care about your well being and help you every step of the way to help you be successful at your new job. All of the management team is extremely supportive and provide all the right coaching so not only do you see it in practice but they stand behind the company principles all the way."
good,"A typical day of work consists of assisting customers in any way possible. I learned how to become more efficient and proficient in helping customers, while learning how to multi-dimensional in the workplace. My coworkers excel in guiding me through the learning process, and are very likeable people. The hardest part of the job would be the busy hours of course, but the most enjoyable part of the job is being in that environment with colleagues that are there to assist you and guide you."
good,"Great place to work. Company has very good work culture. Everyone starting from team members to higher management,people are very friendly and supportive."
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Best Buy. They really care about their employees and if you exceed in your job duties, the opportunities for advancement are endless."
good,I had a great time working at Best Buy. The staff were very friendly and great to work with. I learned a lot about sales and techniques. The hardest part of the job is to come up with solutions that suit everybody and exactly what they are looking for in their budget.
good,"Time goes by pretty fast, there's always something to do, the management is super nice and friendly, and they always feed there team members especially on holidays"
good,Loved working at Best Buy for all the years I did. The problem was they did two restructures in the last three years i was there which limited potential for growth for a lot of lower management employees like myself. They needed to do it to save their business as online shopping has increased substantially but it was time for me to move on
good,"Avoir eu a faire mon stage au Geek Squad a été l'une de mes meilleur expérience de travail avec cette équipe super dynamique et joyeuse que j'ai eu a rencontrer et avec qui j'ai eu a tissé des liens  ( Hammou, Mohamed. Meriam, Dan, Wissam, Bogdan ) ."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best Buy is a company that loves to be involved in the surrounding community. They also offer great benefit packages and employee assistance programs for their employees. Every day at work provides new challenges and experiences.
good,"I learned alot from being in Geeksquad for about a year now. I've gotten alot of hands on experience with troubleshooting client issues with their computers, tablets, phones, tv's, etc. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers because it is a retail environment."
good,"As Best Buy being my first workplace it definetely help me develop as a person and my professional career as a customer service and sales associate. "
good,Is a positive work environment where you get to interact with many different customers on a daily basis. You learn good customer service and retail knowledge as well as learning to meet sales goals.
good,"I could not b happier working at a place that luckily had the best team of people I had ever met, I cannot tell you how motivating it is to see co workers become friends and really grow into a family. after two years and 3 GM changes we stayed together, I have to give BestBuy one thing they do try to work with the best and brightest somehow they all ended up working with me."
good,"At a normal day of work, we are expected to greet everyone with smiles and give the best customer experience that we can. I've learned from working here that people give off vibes and can feel vibes so it is important to read the vibes that are given. My coworkers are really nice and for the most part very helpful and my managers and supervisors give great guidance on how to improve and move forward. Hardest part of working here is the initial contact with a customer. If you aren't bilingual, expect to hit a couple of roadblocks when it comes to sales. Best part is seeing the smiles on the faces that you helped each time you find the prime solution for them."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work if you're looking for a good retail job. A typical day consists of helping customers pick the products that  are right for them (keeping sales goals in mind), assist with setup and protection services, making sure that the sales floor is clean/organized and well stocked, and coordinating with managers and co-workers to ensure a good customer experience. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who are technologically challenged, but good communication skills can help you with that most of the time. The best part of the job is when you show a customer a product/concept they've never seen before, and getting that ""wow, I had no idea that was possible"" type of reaction. I should say that I was blessed to work at an exceptional store, so I can't say for sure that the experience is the same everywhere. Management makes every effort to provide incentives and help you develop into a better salesperson, and they always try to promote from within. Pay is decent (non-commission), especially when the store as a whole is doing well and the bonuses kick in. The only downside is that the primary source of product training is computer e-learnings, which you must take on your own time. It's often difficult to fit them into your shift, especially on high traffic days. Scheduling is good overall, managers do their best to accommodate time-off and availability change requests."
good,"wrote a review for this employer. I do not understand why im being asked to submit another for this same employer, I learned a lot in this job and have enjoyed my time here."
good,"manque de possibilités de grandir dans l'entreprise..."
good,Co-workers were fun to work with. Job was easy and a typical day went by pretty quickly. When the phone rang it kept you on your feet because you didn't know if there was going to be a major problem or just a customer wanting to know when you close.
good,"Best Buy was a very fun company to work for. Management comes and goes frequently, as I worked for 6 different GM's over the course of 5 years. The money is decent: not great, not terrible, but somewhere in the middle. They definitely promote from within so work hard and you'll be rewarded! The employee discount is AWESOME and probably the best perk of the job."
good,I enjoy Working for BestBuy due to the culture set by our management team. Its fun and productive. I get the opportunity to engage with customers and have a first hand on what they are looking for.
good,"Working in a warehouse couldn't be more enjoyable. Working with our crew is never a dull moment. With truck delivers twice a week, you get to see everyone that doesn't normally work during the rest of the week. It gets hard when we get a gigantic truck but once it's done, it's all downhill from there."
good,Everyone is seated doing the qork required of them. Friendly co-workers and efficient environment. Management was great and friendly; listened to employees. Difficulties arose when a lot of samples were delivered and they had to be examined in a timely manner.
good,"The specialty world of Cell phones is one that allows for employees to have a personal relationship with their customers. Its one that is unlike working in a Big Box."
good,"Typical day would be me clocking in, talking with customers and figuring out their best choice of computer for their needs/budget, and downstocking shelf items."
good,Best Buy was a great retail place to work. I worked in customer service with returns and customers wanting to sign up for credit cards. I was also working at Asheville Savings Bank and part of my college years.
good,"The Best Buy staff was full of easy going and enthusiastic co-workers who all want to get the job done."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Working for best buy is a fun and customer friendly job, while work their I learned a lot about product handling and shipping and receiving, labels and stock the floor and end cap displays. I loved the diversity and meeting and seeing new people and laughing with are regular  customers and helping customers find products of their interests."
good,"I learned so much just from one single company. Best Buy not only opened my eyes to different cultures but also taught me so much about customer service. A typical day at work was smiles and knowledge being learned, no matter what I had going on in my personal life when I was working it was like everything has changed. The management was so kind, made me feel welcomes and comfortable. As well as my co-workers who taught me anything I was lacking, I enjoyed working and took any chance I got to work more."
good,The people there are really fun to work with. I learned a lot from best buy. Best Buy taught me how to be a better person. I just feel it is time to move on to bigger and better things
good,"Love working at Best Buy always a fun atmosphere, always learning new things, helping customers get the perfect and complete solution. Providing wold class service and always being the best at our job. Leading the team into victory every day, never giving up on our goals, always aiming higher."
good,A typical day helps a lot of customers with technology questions. I have learned a lot about new technology. People are friendly and make close friends groups.
good,It is a really awesome place to work. A huge learning environment. It is a pretty time consuming job but it is definitely worth the hours.
good,best place i have worked yet.  fast paced energetic and friendly coworkers dedicated to their fields and to the satisfaction of their customers
good,"A typical day of work at Best Buy was fast paced. Get your tools and get in front of a customer. Every customer had a different issue, so it was up to you on how you are going to diagnose the problem and fix it. Since every customer was different however it made the job fun and educational but figuring out the problem was the hardest part of the job. Co-workers worked well together to accomplish this, and the end result, once the problem was fixed, we presented it to the client, which was the most enjoyable part of the job. Because now they were happy that they have a working computer again."
good,"Typical day at best buy is basically going in with a positive attitude and ready to give your 100%  while on shift. Loved working with all my co-workers so I never had a dull shift. Organized all returns so it would be easier to return at the end of the day. Reviewed my performance numbers with my supervisor, and then basically just helping customers as much as I could. The best part of the day would be when I would get really open customers and was able to make short great conversations. I would become family with my regular customers and make jokes. It would make me really happy when my customers would leave completely satisfied and always came back and would always want me to attend them. That time of the day where even I could save someone $10 and they would really appreciate it and would leave happy was definitely memorable moments to me."
good,"Started every day reviewing the schedule and planning the route needed to be taken to reach each customers house in order to install or repair equipment in a timely manner. Drives could take anywhere from a few hours to a couple of minutes, depending on state and location of the customer. The hands on work of the job and the experience gained by working hands on with TV's and Computers was the most enjoyable part of the job, with driving being the least."
good,"Spent the day talking with staff, many 1 on 1's on the floor to keep staff in the loop on all communications and ensure everything was been done by management to give them the best opportunity to succeed at their job.  Weekly management meetings aligned managers to keep the team on the same page an ensure accountability for all of us on the Leadership Team."
good,"Great place to work, fun times with great people while assisting customers and doing it with a smile. Customers in the area are nice. Good, clean, safe location. Management is great! Tons of coaching and fun for employees."

After the store opened 1-5 customers usually came in for service or for pickup. Soon after another tech would come in and help me with thr workload and deadling with thte customers. Throughout the day if my supervisor wasn't there I would address any customer complaints in the department.

good,Best Buy is the kind of place you work at where you don't expect to grow much if you're in school or have another job. Usually the managers and leaders are those that work full time and decide they want to work retail for ever. As a college student during my time of employment its been pleasant. Hours are really easy to work around and coworkers are usually pretty cool.
good,Excellent job if you are looking to get into the customer service field. You will be given plenty of challenges in order to better yourself. Best Buy has always had a very straight line you need to follow in order to succeed and offer excellent training along the way.
good,"I have worked at companies listed several times across the internet as the worst companies to work for. Let me tell you, if Best Buy is popping up on any of those lists, it's got to be a singular case basis. Don't get me wrong--this is a retail job. You still have to fight for metrics and credit cards and deal with over-entitled customers, the whole shebang. Here's where Best Buy gets it right: the corporate culture, while still teeming with those little signs that things just aren't as human as they should be, encourages you to have FUN on this job."
good,It’s a large possibility I would go back if I was offered another position there. I really enjoyed & took pride in my position as a sales associate.

As well as providing us the customer service experience and characteristic tools needed for any other customer service job in any industry.
good,"My manager was an absolute joy. She sticks behind her employees to the bitter end. I had to leave due to the fact that my wife lost her job, and I just couldn't make ends meet by myself. I loved doing home theater installs. (SQQQUUUAAAAD) Geek Squad was an amazing part of BBY to work for. The discounts are PHENOMENAL as an employee, let's just put it that way. Hours were so-so. It just depended on how soon you wanted your day to be over. The faster you knock out your installs, the faster you go home. The people, the atmosphere, the energy, THE CEO, are all awesome. LOVED this job. I'm currently trying to get back in at the store near where I had to move to. It'd be great! Give them a shot. It's worth it."
good,"best buy is a good first job for a teenager. It is relaxed and competitive if you work on the sales floor, discounts are good in some areas. I would recommend this job if you are still in high school."
good,"Everyday was a different challenge for me. I had to relearn where everything goes and organize my portion of the truck based on the area I worked in. So If were to work in the router area, I would need to organize routers, network switches, security cameras, etc. "

good,"Job was not for me because retail, in itself is just not the field for me personally, I love my coworkers. We were all super supportive and helpful with each other. Best Buy has a ton of great benefits and the company provides you with the necessary resources to aid in an  advancement in their company (if needs be). However, as with other retail jobs certain standards were put in place and the demand to ensure you ALWAYS hit the ""target"" was a bit much and it gave me anxiety. If you're into retail and selling do it! AMAZING work culture :)"
good,"It was a fun place to work, everyone there is like a second family. Everyone is very supportive and helpful. Management is also very cool. Everyone there is flexible in what they do."
good,Great work environment everyone is really helpful and if you are new everyone is willing to help you and guide you with any questions you have as well as manager staff is great and very helpful

good,"I love the job , everyone there is very nice and down to earth , i love being an order picker the job fits me very well . my typical day at work is normally picking but i also do other things like processing , ecom, shipping recieving as well."
good,"A typical day at work is never difficult, and very rewarding to help meet customer/client needs. I've learned various policies about warranties through Geek Squad and how beneficial they are. The management team is always on the same page and more than willing to assist with any questions the employees have, and always have your back. The workplace culture is very understanding and there is absolutely no judgement. The hardest part of the job is balancing lack of coverage during the busy times by yourself while also performing daily tasks meant for three people. The most enjoyable part of the job is not having to ask if the services performed were to the client's standard because they will tell you before you even have a chance to ask."
good,A day at best buy could sometimes get crazy but the management team and the general manager would always make sure to keep everything calm and organized. best buy taught me a lot and I even got a chance to go to sales training with definitely helped me a lot with bettering my sales and customer service skills. the hardest part of the job was adjusting to getting the hang of activating cellular devices but once I finally started learn all the right step it became more smooth and easy.

good,"Overall, I enjoyed every day I worked at Best Buy. Helping customers was rewarding, and although you are in sales, it isn't too stressful trying to meet a quota of monthly sales. The employees were nice, my employers were great, and the environment was happy and healthy. The challenging part was finding the time to complete as many e-learnings as possible (they're basically 10-20 minute tutorials/quizes on various products in the store and how to sell them. You must retain a lot of information about a lot of technology to be able to answer and customers questions adequately)."

My managers and coworkers were extremely supportive, helping me through my first few weeks and answering any questions I had along the way. I was taught the best way to go about doing any and all tasks, and I learned all about the programs, products, benefits, and rewards that came with working for Best Buy. For me, having that blue shirt on every day and working toward the benefit of the customers and the company was very rewarding, and I felt very proud when I could be of use."

The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexible hours and the employee discounts."
good,"I've been working from home for almost a year now and it's great. The key factors is responsibilty and disclipline, as it's a position that you can't take for granted. It gives you flexibilty with your schedule, saves time without getting ready and a long commute."
good,"Working at Best Buy was a challenge, but it was worth it. Management always tried to do what was best for the company. Goals and expectations were set and needed to be reached. The hours were great and the employees made it worth it."
good,the store that I worked for truly gave me a foundation to build from learning how to work in a team based environment. and constant product knowledge ..
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Great place to work and many opportunities to grow within the company.
good,"It was this company where I learned what it really meant to sell. What mattered was all the ""add ons"" as in retail this is where any store makes most of its money. I learned how to overcome objections and push sales to the max in this company. Management was very helpful, culture was great, I did enjoy my time here greatly"
good,I loved working there because the store is super clean and they have the latest products in technology so we have new gadgets every few months for us to sell and play with and give our feed back. People from different backgrounds worked together as one team and together we successfully achieved our goal and weekly and monthly targets.
good,It was very simple task of working over there and what I learned that I gotta always work smarter than harder. The job was mostly about delivering boxes from shipments to the customer service for the customer to get their box. The most I enjoy about the job is how much it keeps you active which I love.
good,"For the most post, working there was great! Not really flexible or seeming to abide by what they say. That being said, otherwise  great to work for. I wouldn’t go work there again though"
good,"The work wasn’t that difficult, the people was friendly and willing to work with me with my schedule. Day to day work included helping customers to warehouse work."
good,"In my store in Port Arthur, we are on purpose about building our individual's careers. My experience has been great because I have always felt like growing was always possible and never felt like there was a limit."
good,Show up. Print out your sales report for the MTD and check in with the floor lead then gt to achieving the sales goals for your department every hour. Downstock the shelves in the middle of the shift or when slow. Go home
good,"Just do what they want and won't have a problem, just have to understand they will constantly get on you to do better because they have to advance as a company and can't do that if the employees won't advance themselves"
good,Fair compensation for the job. The job can be very monotonous sometimes but enjoyable experience overall. Managers can be somewhat stressful sometimes.
good,Management was amazing they helped me grow as a sales person and get that confidence. We always felt as a team. I loved going to work everyday. Best buy is a company you can move up in if you work hard.
good,"I was a contractor, and I enjoyed working with this company. Although i was not working as a direct employee of Best Buy, I was a contractor brought in on a temporary project which lasted for about 2years. It was a great pleasure working with highly skilled individuals in their I.T department and we were able to pull through a successful project."
good,Bestbuy was a great company. Holidays could be a little overwhelming and the rotating staff was something you had to get used to. Otherwise it was a fun environment
good,Was a good a job the work place was amazing and also they treated you fare just like how you should be treated. it was also vert warming I highly recommend working works good if also if you love electronics .
good,"It was fast placed, every day their was something new to work on. we helped customer make chooses for them selfies by asking the right kind of questions. Learned a lot about retail and how it works. Management had it hits and miss. It was a over all fun place to work and get to know a lot of good people."
good,It is an excellent work in which I stand out in several positions and got a lot of experience would like to return to have the opportunity to work with the company either warehouse or store.
good,"I was hired seasonally, and I must say, the management team was phenomenal. The coworkers I had were fun as well. Warehouse is definitely a good place to be."
good,"the most enjoyable part of this job is the people i had worked with"
good,Perfect job if youre in college. Best Buy understands that they hire mostly college students and are fairly flexible with scheduling. The pay is also more than any other retail place out there.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I truly enjoyed myself at the store. The staff I was working with was so friendly and enjoyable. I didn't feel like I was alone while training. I was offer constructive criticism. I'm able to work with customers.
good,I love everything about the job. The people you work with for the most part are very welcoming and nice and I loved being in the back working behind the scenes.
good,"Making sure customers' wants and needs are top priority, and be handled in a fast and professional manner. Maintain cleanliness before leaving for the next person for the next shift. Meet supervisor and store goals weekly to appeal store accreditation. Close store with correct currency balances."
good,Assist customer in the gaming and music section as well as maintain organization throughout the departments.  Coping with customers is something i learned that was a big key in sales production.  Nothing was very difficult as I was able to adapt quickly because it was the department i desired.
good,great place to work. great hours. great people to work with. great hours. great pay. wonderful atmosphere. great experience
good,"When I worked there everyone was awesome!!! Crew was great, still have friends there I visit when I'm in town. management was easy to work with, when I told them I was leaving to go to School Full time they supported me, hands down."
good,work culture was very cool in the best buy . manager was vey cool and he motivated me to learn some new technologies and it helped me a lot in learning the new things. i have learned some good programming skills
good,"excellent staff. lots of down time, sweet technology. discounts on limited items ( mostly accessories, laptops they sell them cheaper then the discount, tv's 1 dollar off)"
good,"The work wasn't hard at all, all we did was stack product from the conveyor belt and then stack it onto a pallet to be loaded onto the truck."
good,"plutôt calme belle ambiance de travaille "
good,"great discounts, fun workplace , flexible shifts ,.•	Maintain safe, clean and organized work environment"
good,"Manage the geek squad precinct. Manage labor expectations. employees reviews and one on one coaching and training."
good,"Yo me encontraba en el área de IT que es la venta de lap tops, impresoras, multifuncionales, all in one, etc. Llegaba a mi jornada de trabajo y revisaba las promociones con las que contaba la tienda ese día. Posterior a eso me dirigía hacia el piso de ventas para atender a los clientes que iban llegando, saludarlos de manera amable y responder sus dudas o informarlos acerca del producto que  querían adquirir, los asesoraba, después hacia el cierre de venta. Regularmente yo tenía caja y también le cobraba. Cuando no había muchos clientes me dedicaba a la limpieza y acomodo de mi área, junto con mis compañeros."
good,I enjoy my employment at best buy. I love learning and teaching about the latest and greatest electronics. at the current time
good,"Help customer find products. Learned a lot about new products that are advancing technology. Management was nice, but they aspect a lot from you. I didn't like taking notes about the customers needs while talking to the customer. The discount was probably the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I learned a lot from working for Best Buy. I really enjoyed the sales, customer service and how to work in a retail store."
good,It was a good work experience working in retail and being of assistance with customers and making the customer happy. Working with my supervisors and coworkers was a joy it was a positive environment.
good,great job everyone was friendly always willing to help. never to judge anyone. the hardest part was not knowing when i would be getting off but other than that it was a great place to work
good,I go in and count inventory on items people order. Pick up phones and deal with customer issues.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I worked for best buy as a seasonal helper and I loved it. The people were great. The management was impressive. Everyone helped out with everything. I never heard someone say well thats not my job.
good,"La empresa es buena pero los empleados (gerente, y líderes de venta no) como todo hay personas buenas y personas que no saben hacer su trabajo no todos son así en esa tienda hay otros que son muy buenas personas"
good,"It wasn't the best place to work. The boss was constantly over looking my performance. I was on time every day I was scheduled to work, but I was told that I needed to be earlier than what I was."
good,"I love working at Best Buy but I believe the company needs to work on Job advancement, pay wages, better training for management and employees and the overall management teams within the stores because there has been a lot of favoritism and unethical things that go on in these stores. The job is perfect for COLLEGE STUDENTS OR  PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT LOOKING TO MOVE UP IN THE COMPANY."
good,"Go in get them credit cards, services and don't let your managers know there is something wrong in your department and the rest takes care of itself! "
good,"I would provide Timely updates to the clients to reveal the diagnostic discoveries."
good,The job was fun at first and then due to a changing market and the corporate office not willing to change to meet it the store declined rapidly under managment who was unwilling to listen to its employees.
good,When working at Best Buy mobile I activated phones got customers signed up with new phone companies and troubleshot cell phone data from one phone to another.
good,It's a great place if you really enjoy tech. You must have patience a really good customer service skills in order to be great at your job. Never a dull moment.
good,Management prioritizes work life over anything else. Shifts are erratic and you will never have a work life balance while working for this company. During my time at best buy i did not get a raise while working over 8 months.
good,It's OK job maybe because it's in a bad area but it is a great place to shop can't complain Good job for college students due to tuition reimbursement
good,"Best Buy was a great place to work once.  The culture that was built during my employment with them was great.  Over the years it changed and it lost some of that ""second family"" feel."
good,"Stay for much longer than I should have.  I didn't realize until I left how much of my life I spent away from my family for this job.  There were good times, that's for sure.  But it was constantly high pressure, working all evenings and every weekend, lost vacation time every year and worked almost every open holiday.  I enjoyed the team I worked with and the people though.  Benefits at the time I worked there were good (medical, dental, etc.) and pay seems to be higher than other retailers."
good,i would give information on electronicas and help them buy it.
good,"I was a cashier and my job consisted of making sure every customer had a pleasant time shopping, i also had a little script i had to mention to every customer speaking of rewards, also if electronics i had to sell insurance on products of if no electronics i had to offer magazine sale. i would get randomely tested by supervisor. This job was fun and very fast pace."
good,Discriminate and color blind. They care more about the way you look then your value to the job. There overall work environment was okay.  But the toxic management style limited different minorities to stay stagnate in entry position.
good,"work for salary and commission"
good,We often had to work late as the manager and team leader would take long paid breaks(45 min to 1 1/2 hours) and they would often tell us we weren't working hard enough.  In addition we were often blamed for their mistakes when the store manager pointed them out.
good,"management was one sided but the team was great. fun working with the public but again the management team want their own people,didnt matter who applied"
good,"Its a great place to work however, my hours are not that great at the moment. I want benefits but they dont offer it for part timers."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"not much room for advancement, but a fun place to work. lots of changes in management happen frequently. Long days, but great staff and coworkers. Training program should be more in depth to set employees up for sucess"
good,"I was seasonal, "
good,"A typical day is a scheduled appointment based line which doesn't seem to end because we get a new appointment every 15 minutes, and we don't have the correct staff scheduled to run a efficient business day to day. the hardest part of the job is complying to a quoted completion time of 4 day repairs and not having enough team members working to comply. the most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with. makes time seem like it goes by so quick and makes your time there enjoyable due to everything thats going on."
good,"When you work as a Computer Sales Associate, you also had to take care of Mobile Electronics( sometimes without prior knowledge). During Black Friday was mandatory twelve-hour shifts. Sometimes they would make you sell a different department without any help for anyone.  When you get time to learn about the products from the vendors was interesting because it would be completely new and exciting!"
good,In the last few years best buy has so many changes in the way they run things. Doing away with certain job titles causing employees to be demoted and lose income per hour.
good,"Just very time consuming. It’s also very hard to advance and some of the management is great,while others are jerks. It started out fun and then things just went bad."
good,They shifted around qualified managers and hired a new batch. They were uncaring drones. They promoted people based on how popular they were not based on how effective a leader they could be. They didn’t reward hard work and didn’t punish laziness.
good,I would do it again. it was a great experience. I learned alot and the training has helped me in other areas of work. Management is a problem. They did not create a good culture of work because they did not hear rank and file members at all.
good,"I loved my job. I loved everything about it. With that being said my direct manager was a pervert who never had my back and created such a difficult work environment for me as a young, attractive female supervisor of mostly 18-20 year old men in 5 departments that it really broke me down and I left best buy altogether. The culture is definitely ""it's a man's world"" at Best Buy."
good,"A typical day at work would be greeting customers and selling. Doing customer service such as answering questions regarding billing, repairs etc. Management was great, he was informative with all new promotions and did a lot of coaching to help better my sales and reach my weekly goals."
good,very fun place to work be on time do your job right and you will not have a problem i did not like really working for them i hardly got a break and never god days off
good,Bby was a good company to work for but you are losing yourself to retail. You must understand working retail you lose holidays etc. There are flexible but you have to be able to comprise as well.
good,"The senior management does not care what the local management doing with their workers all they care is about money."
good,"The job is ok for people that don't care to grow as a professional. Not much room to grow as a professional, at the beginning you do learn some new skills but after one year not much more can be learn from the job or the store."
good,"Hours are erratic, hours like 2-9 one day and then 9-7 the next. Weekends can be like 10-8, so forget making any plans. You'll hear about numbers almost every single day, makes it sound like a commission job without the commission pay."
good,Billion dollar company but VERY VERY cheap with how they pay there employers. When it comes to paying there employers who put out almost 100K a day and getting paid $8 a hour that is what I call CHEAP. Love the atmosphere but not worth it for that money.
good,"Trop de gens de la même ethnie qui font du favoritisme"
good,"A typical day at work. Don't really want to review this company. Company is great to work for, in home leaves some desire."
good,"it was great working with a diverse group of people its was great helping customers and getting tips"
good,"good company and great employers, I learned a lot working at this company and wish I could of went further with my position."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I have been working at this place for quite a long time, and I do like it, but the fact of the matter is that there is a wall that, once you hit it, you can't get a raise and, if they don't really like you or want to see you stay in your current role, you're stuck. "
good,I worked various shifts and enjoyed assisting customers. I formed several friendships within the company. I was laid off due to lack of work.
good,"customers will think they are right when they never are, you hav to find the right solutions to have customer satisfaction. sometimes you will struggle but you learn as you go"
good,"The pay was good honestly, but they over worked me like a dog and they were also some-what racist. Even trying to be the best worker I could be after picking up on the racial things. Them wrongly watching my brothers thinking they were going to steal, drove me to quit this job."
good,"Started off being interesting but then the SECOND day was when it started to suck. There’s only ONE full position for AP and even then that ONE person works about 30 hours a week if LUCKY! So me and three other guys were only scheduled maybe 20-22 hours a week if we BEGGED to receive more hours. I worked there for 10 months and not once was I scheduled more than 23 hours a week.  On top of the poor hours my job as “security” didn’t allow me to move out from behind my desk. You have to stand your entire shift....no sitting, crouching, kneeling...just stand still. You never got lunch, you weren’t allowed breaks. You even get in trouble if you TALK with your coworkers! Job just sucked 100%. The only benefit provided was the discounts and it’s probably the only reason why half the people are still there. "
good,Empresa de temporada lo cual no avía formalidad ni estabilidad laboral
good,"na. no comment on this topic. perfer not to answer.  haven worked there in quite some time.  so my opinion can not truly be counted, things may have changed."
good,Best Buy used to care about their employees. I understand things change. They run a Skelton shift on most days and it is very difficult to get help when needed.
good,I come in on a normal day and work as hard as I can doing things above my pay and don’t get any compensation for it and when A position opens up regardless of already doing a lot of the work I get passed up anyways on 5 different occasions.
good,"There's nothing like being out on the open road.. new places, new faces everyday. However, I've come to the point in My life having children and all, where I need a set schedule, normal eight to ten hour shifts. Being a contractor doing home deliveries, it varies from eight to sixteen hours a day, day to day."
good,"Great job for young people starting out!! Gives them experience with life,  people and product. But there is no future there"
good,"Seasonal Job doing PC sales."
good,"good co-workers"
good,"great place to work great products and awesome customers, just was to room to improve and move up in the store/company due to management issues."
good,"If I stayed home with my parents and didn't have bills this would be a great place to work."
good,It is definitely an intersting opportunity and learning experience.
good,Moving Dom part time to full time is impossible unless you’re over the age of 22 for some reason management is very rude to employees which makes it difficult to do better because either way they’ll u less you’re perfect forget about being appreciated
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"shorter hours ,no overtime hour ,no lunch breaks, management was horrible and stockroom was super messy and unorganized and poor communication within the workplace"
good,Not sure how to explain in 150 words but great place to learn selling skills and people skills. Management can be good some times but other times it can also be a drag.
good,"The order must be placed on a desktop and will not work on mobile. If the voucher code doesn't work, please try turning off any ad-blockers temporarily."
good,Best Buy is a great company to work for it has an great atmosphere and also you're always learning new electronics that are coming out. While I was there I enjoyed myself and I made great friends with some of my co workers
good,"My first job was working at Best Buy and I love doing it because i love putting stuff in orders and stocking, I don’t like that they lay you off I feel like they should have let you work a year at least"
good,Great work environment with awesome hours and a compensated pay rate. I loved working here and wished I could have stayed. Sadly it was a seasonal job
good,"Recently downsized, as the business team was relocated to the mothership.  During my years there, I witnessed four large scale layoffs / business goal shifts - where 30-40% of the team were laid off at once.   My business team was finally the last to go, and the company was more than generous with their severance packages and support during the transition.   "
good,"i would have loved the opportunity to actually get hired in to best buy but when there are 500 temps and you promise a job to those who don't miss work or are there all through the 70 hour work week then we come out of those weeks only to be told they are letting everyone go, some get a call back stating they have part time work available so they don't have to pay for your insurance or offer you 401k because YOURE actually part time and they don't offer those royalties to part time employees and that's IF you are the 2 of 500 temps selected"
good,"Great environment, enjoyable place to work, awesome place to learn unique things. Good wages and comfortable suit for anyone who loves to work fluently and help an array of customers."
good,"if u happen to love tech then it a great place u happen to learn a lot.management is pretty cool and have understanding. and willing to work with u,fun people."
good,It's has it's moments sometimes it's the best place other time it really makes you want to find a better good paying stable job. The favoritism is very bad and if you are on the outside you stand a good chance if being let go
good,Best Buy is a great company that takes care of their employees. I loved my years working there while going to school. They are very flexible with hours and are understanding of students and their needs.
good,I worked as tech support . basically all my job was helping customer with some technical issue.it was always busy and I had to deal with some happy and sometime unhappy customers.
good,"this was a long time ago i really don't remember much, but i worked it he cell phone department setting up phone service for customers. it was part time, i wasn't bilingual so i didn't move up"
good,"field work. delivery, mounting and connecting home theater systems. tuesday thru saturday 8am-4pm is the scheduled shift but can vary based on work load. fairly compensated. Certain leaders should not be in the position that they are. yet its who you know, not what you know."
good,i was with the company for 3 years was great at first but could not take vacation time when needed due to big box politics and management. very much like high school  when it comes to the cultre there
good,"Good place to work, sad it was bought a few years back by LabCorp. Good learning environment and I liked my schedule. I was a mobile phlebotomist and I liked the change of scenery every day."
good,A great place to work. The store I worked at wasn't particularily good. Excellent pay and excelent benifits. Other benifits as well.
good,Interaction with customers and associates made the day. No complaints except that retail takes a lot of time away from your personal life if in upper management.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Met a lot of nice people at Best Buy. The managers were really down to earth and guided each employee with respect.
good,"The environment and the people you work with on a line level are incredible, but the more you start taking your job seriously and trying to make a career out of it, its almost as if management wants to hold you back. Especially when you're great at selling. They make empty promises and dangle carrots infront of your face in hopes they can get more productivity out of you."
good,"Innovation is key with this company. I've been with them for many years. Its never a dull moment. Constant changes in technology provide for a great, educational, yet stressful work environment."
good,"On a typical workday I was take about 40 calls a day to assist Best Buy Customers with escalated concerns involving their shopping experience at a Best Buy store. I would research receipt information, Protection plan information. I would file claims on damaged property or products. I would partner with manager to satisfy a disgruntle customer as well. "
good,Very good place to work. Movement within the company is very easy as long as you do your job. Management needs to stop picking buddies.
good,"The company has a great atmosphere and team enviroment to work in. The employees are very friendly and mangement is as well, but also keeps a buisness format for running the operations."
good,"Although I did enjoy working for Best Buy, unfortunately been laid off did not grant me the financial security I am seeking."
good,Great company to work for. Every day is different. You must be customer focused and friendly. Punctuality and good work ethic go a long way. Its tough to move up.
good,"It was a fantastic experience, but unfortunately didn't work out with my own school schedule. I had requested to work fewer hours, but found myself working almost 30 in my first week alone. Everything else about the job was overwhelmingly positive!"
good,Was a learning experience since I started. Long constant hours. No time off to focus on things outside of work. My boss is a pretty well around guy. Always on time
good,"Stocking, Counting each product and putting it in 7 toates, each with it’s own department toate from mobile accessories & phone’s, Video Gaming & Music products, Home Theater products that included audio sound, TVs, HDMI cable Products, And some Cashier duties."
good,"Enjoyed working part time on the merchandising/inventory team. I loved working independently and working as a team to complete daily task. There sometimes was not enough time to finish task, but having a team ensured the store was ready for opening."
good,"Great experience even within 3 months just not a compensation benefit for very much work with understaffing employees "
good,"I have worked at far worse places. If you have a solid management team, or are willing to put in the effort this is a solid place to work. Honestly. Benefits, hours, compensation...all not bad. Yes, you will work through holidays, yes you will work extra hours. Take the extra money, work your way up, and work your way out."
good,Good Company some stores may just not be the best to work for. Overall the discount and pay is good for a high school or college teenager who is looking for a quick job.
good,I loved my time at best buy. Management was ok I just didn't agree with me trying to get more hours a week from another employee that had a physical ailment that made him incapable of performing his job duties properly.
good,"Great place to work with good chances to move up for those that apply themselves. Spent 4 and a half years there til I got laid off thanks to budget cuts. They called it a ""restructure""."
good,The teams that represent the company all have skills in customer service. The teams listened to customers’ needs and recommended the best network systems and appropriate hardware for work and home use.
good,"cool, laid back, good environment, great place to work, not the best pay, flexible hours, great management, they take care their employees, .........."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Great fun places to make friends and sales. Find someone to compete with and you'll love it. Keep out of managements way and do what they ask and you'll be fine. Find your niche early and expand your knowledge from there and you have the possibility to be one of the best sales people in the southeast.
good,Best Buy is a wonderful work place with incredible career advancement opportunities.  The work life balance is not great when reach salaried management.
good,It was a fun place to work for a job that was seasonal for myself.  I could not have been there longer than that is seemed to very much like high school.
good,3 managers i liked every one else micro managed an it was unbearable. defiantly help cultivate confidence. lunches would have preferred to be an hour.
good,Great company but flawed team. Was trained for leadership but never given a promotion. My hours were cut and I was closing and the next day opening for several months. I was very sick on Black Friday and was unble to go home.
good,"well my experience at bestbuy was just a job at first ,it took me while to really get into this company . I feel its all politics if you werent liked you wouldnt move up. I would just say i did have some really great selling skills and didnt feel i got noticed or a chance to move up .I enjoyed my job every single day i love technology and for that reason of being overlooked at i had  told myself it was time to move on."
good,"It's a great place to work in; however, management will consistently stress you out on getting credit card application. I really enjoyed working with my coworkers. You learn a lot of new technology as it comes out."
good,a pesar de ser un trabajo temporal se aprendía bastante y no se sentía el ambiente pesado por lo cual se volvía agradable el trabajo
good,"Día normal en la tienda buscaba precios después de haber terminado mis labores "
good,"Reinforced sales skills "
good,"If your looking to learn about the latest and greatest technology, then I recommend Best Buy. I really didn't have to much of an issue working there except for favoritism here and there and depending on who your manager is you might be treated differently."
good,"I actually enjoyed Best Buy, the hours were so different week to week. But you had to understand what I did. I would look into the company. I did have fun while working."
good,"You learn about the products and they do role play to get you comfortable giving information to customers. They send you to places like New Orleans, or Covington, or Baton Rouge for tech conferences and sales meetings."
good,"As far as degree less jobs, this one was enjoyable. Everyday there was good encouragement from superiors as well as great peer support. Everyday the employees were great, though the work could become stressful, especially the requirements to meet sales and the repeated extra training they'd try to enforce if goals weren't met because of it."
good,"Excellent company to work with and be willing to work any Holidays or weekends. Be open minded and ready to work under stress situations, highly customer skills and long schedules."
good,"Best BUy is a good place to start workering , if you are new to retail and you would like to work aroud electriconics . I feel best buy is in a tough place . It is the last of the electronic stores!"
good,"Originally, the culture of the stores I worked in was to die for! It was always fun and hard work. Team work all around with people I could depend on. Unfortunately, the company made changes and our GM moved on. The new hire was external, came in to change everything and had no idea of the culture of the store or company! Things did not work out well and they lost a lot of good people. It used to be fun before her. They should have promoted internally. The acting GM during the interim period would have maintained the culture and continued the productivity versus it all going down the drain."
good,"Company seems to be eliminating full time positions and going to part time or contract (maximum 6 months). Everyone is expected to perform multiple duties as required receiving, shipping, repack, disposition which are rotated throughout the day and week."
good,Job was ok it was just too short it was over when job was done.  Enjoyed the word and people I worked with.  Everyone worked as a team.  Would like to do this part  time.
good,I worked in the Entertainment area. Assisting customers with choices on different televisions and surround sound equipment. I also helped out in the car area as well.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.

good,nice company to work very fun fast place job lot too  learn good experience get too see all the new electronics an deal with customers from all around the world.
good,"as a assistant manager of sales there was much pressure to drive credit applications and other services. in my opinion the sales culture was driven the wrong way, instead of just wanting credit applications they should have been driven with training for employees with a propose to solve for the customer as just getting credit apps is just a compliance number vs closing the sale thru credit applications. in my case new leadership at my location forced me out as they had a different vision/approch......"
good,Easy job as long as you do it. I learned about the new technology that was coming out. Management was okay. Co workers were great.

good,"Management expects a lot of you with little to no compensation. You are expected to up sell and sell add ons on everything that walks out the door but a lot of the add ons and up sells were over priced and when you didn't up sell your days got cut. The general manager was the best, the other managers were way to hard on co workers. the hardest part of my job was gaining the knowledge of everything in the store you had to know.

You get paid weekly so you see what your making right when you need it !"
good,excelente empresa buen ambiente de trabajo  califico de manera buena
good,"You get scheduled a typical set of hours depending on location and team role, but depending on your skills and any problems you face, you tend to not get off work when you are scheduled to get off. Otherwise you may get off several hours early and have to use your pto to hit the 40 hours. It’s very hit or miss and again depends on your role and geographical location. If you are someone who puts your job before the rest of your life then you will love this job. Making plans to do anything other than on your days off are are very difficult."

I never felt like I was just another pawn at the two stores I have worked at and I always feel that my individuality and personality are encouraged to be expressed at work. The benefits are great for part-timers who are still in school or fresh out looking for some steady income before landing in a career path. "
good,The managers can let things go or not communicate well. Especially being out on deliveries. Other than than its pretty loose and most people do their job but there are always those who take advantage of not doing anything anytime they can. My biggest issue happened when my best friends mom passed away and my supervisor told me I had to miss the funeral to work. That is when I decided it wasn't the right fit for me. I had been working to hard and to long of hours by myself in delivering appliances and the one day I needed off because of a funeral I was told I couldn't have it to be with my friend when he needed me. Overall though the pay is good and the atmosphere for the most part is easy going.

Overall the management there was very helpful and sincere, they truly cared about their employees and showed appreciation."
good,"It’s difficult to review the company based on the one store I work at. If we followed the standard operating procedures set by the company, I would rate the job as excellent.

good,Best buy was by far my favorite job I've held. From opening a new store and building a community around our coworkers and surrounding town. My management team prepared me to field all sorts of questions and how to come up with a satisfying solution for clients. The most difficult part of working at best buy was getting promotions from my experience management seemed to always have in mind who they were going to hire before posting available positions.
good,"Good entry level job into sales. Has good benefits. Hard to get promoted unless you’re a favorite. Easy to hit goals, and pay was decent. It was hard to get time offf and you work on holidays like thanksgiving and christmas eve"

good,Best Buy values employee input and will give you the tools to be successful. My management team genuinely wants to see me grow and improve for my own sake.
good,"It was a nice place to work. The only thing i didn't enjoy was having to sell warrenties to customers. I feel it a customer is interesed in that, after their purchases were rung up they should have been sent to a line where they exclusively wrote up contracts. I felt it slowed the line down frustrating both cashiers and customers waiting to be checked. out."
good,I walked around all day and greeted customers and assisted them in making informed buying decisions. The workplace was awesome and many of the employees are helpful to one another.
good,it was a cool job very productive had fun with customers also It is an learning experience to get to learn new faces everyday and also interact with diff people is fun as well
good,Enjoyed every shift I was scheduled. This was the first sales job I had and it was very enjoyable to work at. I wasn't working there for too long but I enjoyed the time while I was there.

good,"I am a brand ambassador (rep) for Oculus Rift Virtual Reality headset. I work weekends and enjoy my time working inside Best Buy. The staff and people at Best Buy are professional, courteous and everyone does a great job to facilitate a clean and relaxing atmosphere. Sales are not hard pushed, the guys in blue shirts are well trained and enjoy their jobs. Very few negatives heard around the workplace. Made good friends and enjoy coming to work and sharing stories of our week. Everyone is very knowledgeable about products and best buy policies and i am always asking questions and no one feels annoyed or not wanting to talk to me. We joke around and have fun too but we always know when to be good workers and provide customers with best customer service, and I feel we do that every weekend at least. As a brand rep for Oculus i feel a part of the team rather than just an add-in that's not part of the real employees at Best Buy. They take care of each other and often order food and get food for each other for example, and I never feel restricted or having to watch what i say or do, as long as I am doing my job and not negatively impacting others, everyone gets along great. Management seems to be on top of things, the store always looks great and sales are up on a weekly basis. We all have a lot of pride for our job, it may not seem like much of a job, but from what I have seen and experienced while working here, we love what we do and that's really important in retail."

good,Very team oriented. Advancement opportunities and training galore. Hands on and customer driven company. Great benefits and discount. Participate in community events and lots of vendor events.
good,Bestbuy is a great place to work for a young adult. The downfall is in management. The advancement you worked so hard to get will be undermined daily making you wonder why you worked so hard to get where you did.

good,"I enjoyed working here. My co workers were nice and most managers were too. I was hired to work in the mobile department, but they needed me to help over at Customer Service. It was Customer Service where I ended up for the remainder of my employment. I started on black Friday and worked 15 hours with no training. I did really well. I always stay busy and help customers. I enjoy helping people and I have a strong desire to get things done. This company was a good place to work even though It was a temporary position and I was there for a short time. While I worked there I picked up shifts for call outs all the time, stayed late and Rotated between customer service and the front registers. I did like the work environment and enjoyed the sales they had for Christmas. This company gave me the opportunity to become more knowledgeable of electronics and how they work."

good,I have a variety of skills that i have gained over the years. I can do pretty much anything in the kitchen. I really enjoyed interacting with customers while in retail and resturaunts.
good,They hassle you to sell warranties and get customers to sign up for the best buy credit card!  Pretty much want to coach you if you don't get a lot of warranties or cards every shift.
good,"The employees were a family. Working there i felt as if I could turn to anyone if i needed help. They worked hard and if the saw someone struggling, they would do their best to help each other out."
good,"Typical day at work is taking returns making the warehouse look presentable, and taking care of customers if the floor was busy. Most enjoyable part of the day was seeing the new inventory come in."
good,"Great place to work with plenty of opportunity to grow within the company! I started out as a cashier and then moved to a full time customer service position. 6 months later, I decided to take a full time job as a team lead/floor sales associate. I worked on the floor in many different departments such as; home theater, cameras, video games, car electronics and appliances."

good,"The benefits of a major corporation in a nice environment. I was in their repair center, not the stores. Very reliable management of hours and time off and such. No drama."
good,"easy job, but the fact there waqs no commision provided no added motivation for the sales staff, and in comparison to other electronic stores while we did have the products the customer service was not there."

good,"Job was decent, just had to sell some stuff, and translate for the customers who didn't speak English. There was however no room for professional growth in the company"
good,"Since it was a contract based job, I had targets to meet every now and then. Although the work was bit hectic, team members and the manager were great and it was wonderful to work for them."
good,Fun place to work along with great people.  The pay isn't one of them unless you're a manager or a higher up there.  The discount was great as well so that helps the mental attitude working there.
good,"Management is great and workers are friendly. The job is very organized. Customer service is a bit challenging, because the customers are very rude and irate at times."
good,Best buy was great. I was trained at many positions. This job trained me to how to sell and exist in the marketing and business aspect of the working world.
good,"I worked in mobile sales for seasonal, Christmas and black Friday season. The hours were fantastic so were the employees. There was a lot of down time as long as you did your job correctly. Breaks were given regularly. Small contests to win things. Most difficult part of the job is pushing credit card applications. Most enjoyable is the ability to freely talk with customers with out being salesman pushy."
good,"The benefits were good, and the managers were extremely willing to work with employees on schedule conflicts. You got hours if you needed them and they would help you out if you needed a day off."
good,"An average day usually ranges from helping out and answering any questions customers may have, to restocking and laser lining three departments. I've learned to manage my tasks as well as picking up the slack from others without complaint as I enjoy my job and do it well and orderly. The only difficult part would be managing some of the tasks that are given, alone, when sometimes its a two manned job and takes up more than the allotted time allowed. I enjoy the times I manage to make customers day and they later come back and thank me for previously helping them."
good,Great first place to work at. More than enough hours to work with some overtime here and there. Helpful coworkers and supervisors. Good introduction for anyone wanting to get into the workforce.
good,I worked on a crew that remodeled best buys. we would put in all the new displays and just update the look and feel of the store. It was a great time cause i worked with such a tight knit crew

I gained greater knowledge of handling escalation calls as well as gained greater knowledge of computer software such as office and excel."

good,"Tecnología al alcance de todos, buenos servicios al cliente"
good,"Cool place to work very helpful and i learned alot, i would work there again, i enjoyed the atomosphere,i loved being around electronics and helping poeple, all the mangers were really nice"
good,"good fast pace sales environment, good for anyone whos really good with an assortment of technology and if you are able to work in both a slow pace and fast pace environment and can delegate their time wisely."
good,The pay is okay but there is not a ton of room for advancement. Plus my management changed often when ever they felt like reorganizing the company which happened like 3 times I was there.
good,The job can be very lucrative if you want to stay with the company to become a GM or the like. Other wise as a full time employee the benefits are good and can help if you are in college during  your time there

good,I learned to be very balanced and multi task efficiently. The work culture is very enjoyable and has a lot of positivity surrounding it. The most enjoyable thing about working there would have to be being around all the new technology once is came out.
good,Best buy was a super fun place to work. the only thing I didnt enjoy was the retail  hours. Besides that its was really cool. I enjoyed management and my co workers.
good,Best Buy is a great job for me due to my knowledge with computers and my ability to help anyone that needs help most of the employees there are very reasonable and fun to work with.
good,Working for Best Buy offers some decent benefits but makes moving up difficult and riddled with political backstabbing.  Get in good with management and you have a chance.
good,I enjoy all of my job responsibilities and respect my piers and the management that runs the company. My main reasons for wanting another position is the job is less challenging than it used to be.
good,"Best Buy is a good place to start If you never been employed. I applied to work in the computers department and ended up working in the warehouse. The hardest part of the job is the physical aspect. I think lifting heavy objects can take a tole on you as you get older. The funnest part is the people and the environment. I literally had good conversations with customers the past few years. A typical day at work, stocking product, scanning signs, shipping and receiving. I've learned that there's always room for improvement."
good,"This was a great very competitive environment. It allowed me to hone and perfect my understanding of sales. They sent me on multiple sales seminars, to which I always used to my absolute advantage."
good,"this company provides excellent benefits for those who qualify and work the mandated amount of hours. the benefits such as employee discount are unmatched,"
good,"Create a relationship selling products, services, and solutions by getting to know the customers and helping them with their specific requirements.

good,"Very family oriented, definitely a company worth working for. Employee accommodation is another thing worth getting especially if you have a new home that need new electronics."
good,"Not only were then managers and supervisors chill and friendly, the workers were just as amazing.

The staff were also extremely helpful (Well most of them anyways)."

good,best Buy has a great idea in the direction they want to go. Especially with the Geek Squad. Overall thought the company has taken a complete 180 degree turn. it seems like the focus is more on money than keeping the employee happy. Unhappy employees dont bring good business. Most complain that the changes are to fast for us to adjust but in the end we the employee are being blamed for not getting to where we need to be. The company needs to do its change in steps.

good,"A typical day at work would be sorting returns into bins in the warehouse of the company, assisting customers with returns as wells as trouble shooting problems and exchanges. Before the company rearranged the first time, I assisted Geek Squad with resetting, updating, and shipping computers to the main company for repair. Before the holidays they reorganized a second time and started lay offs, I was mainly on returns and exchanges. I would have Geek Squad employees check products that customers claimed were faulty to check if they could be returned, whether it was something caused by the customer or the company, and whether it could go back on the shelves as an open boxed item or be returned to the home company. My favorite part of the job was working on the computers. There was much satisfaction gained from learning something that I could do not only for customers, but to repair my own equipment or help family members. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with irate customers. Best Buy has pretty defined return policies and when customers would compare us to another company's return policy they would immediately want to speak with a supervisor, who would tell them the exact same things I just had. It was hard to explain that even if we gave an exception to a return, the only thing that they would receive was a store credit and not cash."
good,"Working at Best Buy was a huge learning curve for me. They teach you a valuable skill-set that is applicable in any job, sales or not.

Also, all the logistical processes, maintence issues, payroll, budgeting, merchandising and servicing were managed by myself."

The hardest part of the job was staying current with all the awesome products that came out almost daily but that was also the most enjoyable because I not only had a chance to use the product I also helped customers with their decision on purchasing wireless products and services all while showing them how great it would benefit their everyday life."

I learned things everyday, as far as different ways to handle and approach customers, how to space out my duties and tasks in a way for them to be completed on time, knowing and learning different selling techniques, and learning how and what to look for as far as fraud. The management was always there whenever needed and never acted as if they were too busy to take care of even the small problems. As far as co-workers, they were always a joy to be around and always helped if needed and were not busy. I would say the hardest part of the job was the selling of credit cards, but in return was also the enjoyable part of the job, because at the end of the day it was a personal challenge that I would set for myself.

I have a lot of responsibilities and I never would have known how much I can handle if I weren’t pushed to my absolute limits. I am able to look past the smaller issues and come up with solutions to bigger problems. My coworkers are excellent because we are able to split up the tasks and work as a team to make sure that the job gets done. One of the huge challenges that I face daily are issues within our internal Warehouse & order management systems. I was working here during the transition from the older system to our new system and was able to see all of the issues that were created as a result of these systems. However, dealing with all of the system issues has forced me to become an excellent problem solver and I am great at coming up with a workaround in order to get a solution. I enjoy being able to think outside of the box & applying it to issues at work to come up with a solution for our customers."

good,"A typical day, you would come in and log in. Stand in the spot they told you too and address customer issues while fixing displays in free time. The work was standard and the pay okay. Did not enjoy the company of fellow employees, everyone seemed to be putting up a front. I even had a employee tell me I was not going to last and will be fired. Was my first day. Seemed to be a uncomfortable environment and the vet employees were always out to get your job, always acting like sales were based on commission. The hardest part of the job I would have to say is the 2-5 100 question tests you had to do in a short time period while on duty. Most enjoyable part for me was to help the customers especially when it was on a topic I was passion about."

good,"Out of every job I have ever held, my time with Best Buy was one of the greatest! The people were always willing to help and management had no issues with jumping on a computer in order to help a customer find something if they rest of us were already with customers. It was like a real team; they took your suggestions and some of them they would even use. I even enjoyed going in early for meetings- that has never happened! They listened to their employees and even one morning they bought breakfast, and knowing one of the girls was a vegetarian made sure they got something specifically for her that she could eat."

My management and co-workers alike are friendly, easy to get along with, and, are very knowledgeable in their fields of expertise, and get their sale plans across accurately. The most challenging part of my job is overcoming obstacles in selling services to customers, but rewarding once achieving the sale and showing how the customer benefits from the extra services.

good,Positive work environment with helpful management and plenty of oppurtunities to advance in the company.
good,Fun work environment. Great team atmosphere. Good customer interaction.
good,Selon moi best buy est un parfait endroit pour évoluer en temps que personne.
good,"very easy and fun job to have. The employees are great, managers were kind and helpful, my position was seasonal and my only complaint is they told me they would call after new years for me to become full time employee and they never contacted me"
good,"Great work place! Enjoyed going into work every day with fun and exciting people. The management was kind and considerate of who you are, always accepting and fun."
good,"Yo entre sin tener nada de experiencia, no te excluyen por ser nuevo, hacen actividades de integracion muy entretenidas."
good,Great people to work with. You get to learn a lot and experience different skills. You get to learn more about electronics. Great benefits and discounts.
good,"I took the 12 hour second shift 6 days a week and made a lot of money. Unfortunately its only seasonal so youn are laid off right after Christmas. You can have a perfect review and still be laid off, like i was. I had only called in one time in six months and was laid off. Overall there is no job security but if you work the hours youre guaranteed unemployment."
good,Working there was the best job I’ve had I would love to make that much money and be surrounded by hard working people seasonal work is the best way to make some extra cash for the holidays
good,"It’s a great job , the people were friendly there’s room for growth , and the environment felt safe. I learned a lot about electronics while working there."
good,Wanted to become a fulltime employee. Competitive pay; fun work environment; a lot of autonomy and ability to make judgement calls; cutting-edge technology and work with energetic people who like to have fun helping people.
good,I only worked at Best buy for a few months. Didn't have many complaints. I was only working there temporarily waiting on a job with the state. I would definitely recommend to college students
good,A typical day at BestBuy was attending to customers based on their needs for the merchandise of they are interested in purchasing. What I learned while working at BestBuy was the new products that were in the market and how it would benefit the customers. The management staff were motivational and encouraging for the sales representatives to sale customers the best merchandise products that best suit there needs. The hardest part of the job was selling to customers and meeting up with the days quota. The most enjoyable part while working at BestBuy was being surround with so many gadgets because it made the environment to be exciting.
good,"Very much enjoyed my time working here! The staff is welcoming and helpful, the hours are great and the pay is very reasonable. I would 100% recommend working at a BestBuy near you."
good,"You get out what you put in, the culture is great but as you climb up in the company, politics are more the name of the game. Scorecards will make or break you."
good,"If you enjoy learning and selling tech, then Best Buy is a fun place to be. I worked in the Digital Imaging department and was able to branch out and learn about computers, car audio, and home theater. It was a fun experience."
good,The management were so bad that almost all of the former employees left. They used to force us to sell more. And they used to give us hours on our sales basis which is contradictiry
good,"Best Buy is great, if you work in Corporate and not the actual stores. There is little to advance in stores. I know people who were sales manager and made it to general manager in ten years. For most sales specialist there is no advancement opportunity. The basic sales jobs are not really careers in my opinion. Only if you get to be a supervisor and find a full time position can you advance, possibly. However, corporate information technology and supports jobs are way better."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best gives a good family atmosphere while still being a massive company that is trying to get a corner of every technology market.  Look at building relationships with customers and employees alike.
good,Great company if your planning to work for a year. The starting pay is 11.50 and you have a lot of opportunities to advance if you work hard and don't have any occurrences on record.
good,"Not much to say work was quick and easy, even of the busiest days there wasn't to much to complain about. the hours and pay was good. the employee benefits where amazing."
good,"Best Buy provided so many avenues for career advancement, sales development and customer service.  The main reason I stayed with Best Buy for so many years was seeing several employees at each location truly go out of there way to make sure each customer is taken care of and that they had the right information.  Best Buy provided several tools to help there employees accomplish this and consistently provided training's and one on ones to follow up on this behavior."
good,"I worked there for several months and did a great job. Unfortunately when it came to move out of my customer service position, the date that I was supposed to start was delayed by an extra week and there was no pay raise for the position. After hearing that I would not be able to start in the position I wanted to be in for another week and there would be no added benefits to the position, I had to leave. I loved the environment and my co-workers but after doing my job above and beyond without any acknowledgement or added benefits, it was time for me to leave. I'm sorry if you're my employer and reading this but this is how I felt"
good,"When I first started my managers were great, some politics happened and they were replaced. Their replacements were amongst the worst managers I've ever had and as a result, made my life miserable. Best Buy paid 50% of my masters degree and I wanted to try and get into corporate through the connections I had made. But working in the store became so unbearable that I ended up seeking other employment first."
good,"A good workplace for college students or those who want to advance in the technology industry and get up to corporate. flexible with hours for the most part especially if you have a good relationship with the managers they will usually hook you up. "
good,When I worked in the store I had many responsibilities. I usually say there is no job that if assigned that I would say no too. But sweeping the garage and cleaning the bathrooms were a bit demeaning. But I did them and smiled. That earned me favor with management. Of course some employee saw me as a butt kisser. That usually did not matter to me.
good,The time at best buy was beneficial it helped me learn about products and helped me to get into my next job. Best buy mobile does need to get more commission. Selling for every carrier isn't easy at all.
good,"Working At Best Buy while attending college was great. Phenomenal Management, Great Co-Workers. Learned a lot through meetings, training on product knowledge and services/solutions offered by the company. They also had incentives for employees aside from hourly pay, like compensation for sales goals etc. Great work environment with potential to move around departments and potentially within the company based on performances."
good,I loved who I worked with at Best Buy and they really allowed you to be yourself there. It felt like the positions and hours were constantly changing.
good,"Best Buy is great place to to work and learn.  Retail is not for everyone, but if you enjoy a team environment and interacting with people, you will enjoy it."
good,I worked in the appliances at Best Buy and the sales pace is fun and competitive. The reason why I decided to leave was because the retail hours are an absolute drag and you have to make sacrifices. For example I am unable to attend most family events because I work 9-10 hour days almost all the time. It is hard to balance work and life on that schedule.
good,"Working at Best Buy was like being in Highschool. If you weren't in the ""in click""you were treated poorly. Co-workers wouldn't help you. During the first week I had to Shadow different employees on the phone, they made it extremely clear newbies weren't welcomed and made you feel unwelcomed. Management has no control over there employees. I wouldnt even recommend Best Buy to a homeless person."
good,It was a great experience for starting out. Taught me a lot for the time that I was there and I enjoyed it. They were consentient in what they were implementing to their team members.
good,"good work environment, everyone got along very well. Managers were very enthusiastic about their job. Background on technology is not required, you learn along the way and everyone helps on another out."
good,"The company is fantastic but the simple matter of the fact is that your job is not secure, the moment your sales begin to slip in any way shape or form they have no problem cutting you."
good,"I loved the environment that was created at both of the stores that I worked in.  It was like a family, and the management was willing to help those that needed training.  It was the only retail chain that I worked for that genuinely cared about the people that worked for them.  The downside is that little PTO that they give you for the whole year and the write up system.  I didn't get written up; however, I have coworkers that got written up for not being able to come in due to family issues.  It does depend on the upper management and your performance."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,it is fast paced
good,Great discounts and good social interactions. you never know who you will meet there. They have good training as well as good job advancement if you stay there long enough.
good,It was a great job working around stuff you have most interest in. Talking to new people everyday about stuff you love and try to make sales on stuff you know.
good,"Best Buy is a hard driven business model, they demand workers bring their best to the work place and reward accomplishment.  BBY training is world class, management is involved with workers to do more and better."
good,"hard to move up and hard to get raises. i feel like compensation was fair,  but as they raise your work load they are unwilling to raise your pay.  also you are pressured into adding to a sale even when the customer declines"
good,Mossy management had no social skills ans could not seen to deflate a lot of issues with employee or guests ..but very knowledgeable in store tunings and procedures
good,"I typically work for this company every season. It's a great way to get some extra holiday cash. The work is pretty simple, not hard at all. They now have the option for different shifts. Overall good job. Possible hire in after 90 days."
good,"I would walk in, clock in, grab my folder and take care of the things listed on the board, grab my goal sheet, have it signed by manager and assist customers with product information."
good,"Fun place. Management was horrible at my store but other stores great. Good work/life balance except for on holidays. Loved the people, job but the management was biased and as soon as you are hurt they w\find ways to start giving you bad reviews and make life hard. forcing you to want to leave"
good,I wasn't here to long to really give a good summary for. Management was descent too communicate with but at times was too personal. There was in my perspective not much room to learn much besides what you were hired for. The most enjoyable part was the up-selling part of my job being a cashier trying to get people too purchase extended warranties and such.
good,"Compared to serving lates at Barnes and Noble... working in Best Buy has been a great experience.  I was able to finish my college education on time and without any interference.  The staff was able to help me see my full potential, and I was able to help them boost sales or set up weekly ad sets for upcoming sales.  For college students I can not recommend this job enough.  Best Buy has been great to me."
good,"The situation is here, if you can handle stressful days, and also not stressful days, this is a perfect fit for you. if you cannot handle a job that bounces your schedule around, then avoid this place at all costs. Many times I had to close, then open the next day, then go mid shift the day after that. Welcome to retail."
good,Best Buy has an awesome culture built around developing their employees to be the best version of themselves.Making an investment to their already awesome team is what is driving their success.
good,I enjoyed my time with the company and enjoyed the people I worked with.  Although they didn't seem to give as much respect to the employees as much as they did customers
good,"Best Buy as a company is a wonderful company to work for. However the in store management, at least in Texarkana, is mediocre at best. There is no compassion for entry level employees and no leaneancy on personal issues."
good,The job requires you to wear many hats. Which ultimately gives you the ability to adapt and push you to your very limits! Management has always been a issue within my market but I'm unsure how the company is ran outside of Chesterfield and Richmond Virginia.
good,"Best Buy is doing big things, I think they should increase their pay, other than that, they are a pleasure to work for. I would recommend this job to a friend."
good,"If you are a sales associate, it is fun and competitive. If you are customer service, it is easy but can get tedious and boring. Overall i like it very much."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The work there is hard and there is always a lot to do. Some days may be fast paced while others are very slow. This is a job for someone who doesn't mind doing all the work themselves.
good,Cool place to work growth in company if you desrie it and put in the work for it.  The people you work with are cool adn the customers make it fun. I enjoyed it.
good,This is a good job for a college student or just someone who is trying to get a decent job in retail that doesn't demand too much time. The store i worked in had young minded management so i wasn't to pleased with the way it was ran.
good,"went in super early every morning, cleaned and organized the store. It was a wonderful job for someone who had been introverted and preferred to do work on their own. great coworkers made the days fly by. But they struggled with working with the school schedule i had at the time."
good,"The job was overall good, but a lot of products kept on going missing. The store wasn't that much organized. In the mornings, there was this one manager who would always come late and then the employees on the shift including me would have to punch in late aswell."
good,has good benefits typical retail environment. management can be hit or miss but generally very good training. seems the company gets better every year.
good,I had an easy time learning and exploring my job. Management was great and understanding of my situation when I had to leave work. the job wasn't hard  and my co-workers were fun to be around.
good,So I worked at multiple locations somewhere great somewhere bad. The one I left at the management it all depended on who you were best friends with whether or not you got a promotion. I did spend many years here and I did enjoy it.
good,a typical day at work was average passed at times other times it was fast passed depending on the amount of work coming in the culture was by far the best experience and i loved everything about the job.
good,Very fun place to work even better people. Its even better when you love techy stuff and all the new stuff to come out and discojnt was amazing ........
good,"The job was okay. The state doesn't really pay much as most of the positions are based on grants. Once the grant is gone, pretty much the position goes with it."
good,"handled client computer needs, provided services and advice for consumer tech. most enjoyable part of the job was helping clients."
good,"This job is very good at attending to Customers but its biggest lesson is learning to make a sell. You are taught how to read people by their actions and reactions, body language, apparel, anything that can help you make their decision easier and less stressful. I enjoy this job."
good,I have worked with Best Buy on and off for 5 years and they have never provided me better opportunities with the company. It has a great atmosphere but they d not give their employees opportunities to advance in the company.
good,Typical day sucked no bathroom breaks and very little employees overall I did enjoy working there though and it was fast paced but the lack of employees meant you were the man for everything and no recognition for it aswell.
good,"Great, friendly staff. Management makes sure you are fully trained before you ever work alone. "
good,"There really isn't room for advancement in BestBuy. They work you long hours with just over minimum wage. They promise you raises that never come or are pennies on the dollar. Took me 2 years to get a lead position, and once it was time to sign the papers I was told I would have to wait another year. The work was not to difficult. Coworkers were fun and friendly, and most of management was kind and understanding. I enjoyed helping people learn about tech and help with their issues. I learned a lot about all tech, how to be a efficient manager. and how to rebuild cellphones and computers."
good,Worked with some amazing people. It was a very fun working environment. If I really wanted to go back I would. Having fun while being the best is true when working here.
good,"When got hired, I was told I was being hired for the season in Florida. They let go all of the new employees right after Christmas."
good,As long as work was done on time there are no problems with management. Time management is a must have. It would have been nice to have more then one person per store.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Depends in wich store you work,you will have people to put you down.Great pplace to work but when the wrong people have higher positions,they feel untochable and they disrespect employees.That's in store 862,ocala fl.In store 510,orlando fl,that's the place to work,feel like family and they apreciate the job from a former us.Army soldier."
good,"Great Experience, great company but weekend and personal time can be hectic.  Overall working every day to thrive client experience that not only earns their trust but also continue to provide support on daily needs."
good,"Out of all of the my Job experiences,this has been by far the best.I enjoyed everything . From learning new things everyday to helping someone new everyday."
good,Good place to have a first job. Enjoyable team and management. Learned a lot how to deal with all types of customers.  I would recommend for someone in high school to start here.
good,It was a fun place to work. there wasn't to much to actually do when you were a sales associate. was a good place to learn about new technology and how to troubleshoot different products.
good,Helped me to be better at customer service. Learned how to sell to customers. They helped you to do the best you can do so you would be able to advance.
good,I have worked at many different Best Buys and have learning that it can be fun if the managers want it to be. The benefits are great but it can be hard to advance.
good,"Best Buy was a very good place to work if you needed a job quickly and did not care too much about the pay or benefits at the time. The manager over the merchandise department was caring, he looked out for his workers. He listen to us when we talked or had good ideas about doing things, our opinion mattered to him."
good,"BestBuy is a fun place to work at when you are young and looking for good work experience. Geek Squad is a great place for anyone looking to get in the IT field with little experience. When you first join Geek Squad you will be a consultation agent, which is the first person to greet the clients and try to figure the best course to fix their computer. Your job is to check in computers and sell services to clients that come in. once a computer is checked in you then pass the computer to advance repair agent (also called ARA) will look at the check-in notes and proceed with repairs needed for that computer. Most ARAs have anywhere from 10 to 25 computer to work on at a time. along with keeping a detailed work log of each computer that is checked in for Bestbuy records. ARAs also are encharge keeping good customer relations with each client making sure all work is performed to the client needs and satisfaction, Keep clients up to date with their repair is very important. The hardest part of the job is that the job can get a little crazy at times with some much going on. The best part about the job is seeing a computer going from completely unusable to running perfect and seeing how grateful they are that it is working again as they hoped."
good,Great place to work if your just going to school and need some extra cash but not for a career you need to play to much politics
good,"Currently employed there and deal with all types of issues, from customer problems with their cellphones to assisting them to getting their best fit device. Also have some aspects of obtaining old phones and filing proper procedure to have them recycled and shipped out."
good,"The people really make the job when working for this employer.  Also, the store's location, as depending on where you are located, it has more to do with the success (and happiness) of the store than anything.  Take it from me, who's worked for 3 different stores in two states."
good,I personally love the work I do for Geek Squad! Unfortunately since Best Buy purchased the brand Geek Squad is no longer viewed as a part of the service industry. It's now viewed as retail and the pay is reflected in that. The hardest part of the job is the clientele. Rarely do I get someone thanking me for the work I or my coworkers perform. Most of the clients in my precinct are rude and their expectations are far above what the Geek Squad can provide. I mostly enjoy the experience I receive from the work that I do. Nothing is more satisfying than digging and in and fixing something! I also learned how to navigate and repair the Apple iOS during my time with Geek Squad. Apple is not immune to software issues regardless of what you may have heard. Management for the most part is pretty decent.
good,"It was a fun environment. I truly loved my co-workers. The GM at my location was absolutely awful. I enjoyed talking and building relationships with my co-workers as well as my customers. I learned next time you're having an issue with anyone you work with - note it, note it, note it."
good,"Its a great routine Monday-Friday schedule, I have learned to grow from challenge and change. There has been a recent restructure that will bring a lot of change for the business."
good,I learned how to better serve customers and how to optimally sell to a wide variety of people. I have been able to stay up to date on many different types of technology.
good,Best Buy was an amazing place to work at. It was always a fun environment and you always had opportunities to move up in the company until they changed management. When they changed management they made it very difficult for you to advance in their company and they would change your shift last minute without letting you know. But I did learn a lot from there. I started as a cashier and moved up to work at the customer service dept. I had more responsibility and more challenging situations to handle.
good,"The job was great, the discount was amazing but the management was very one sided, either their with you or against you but overall great place."
good,Fun work place. Good job to have during high school or college part time. It is a good place to start building your resume. You learn a lot about different companies.
good,"The only problem I have with them is that I was planning on going to a job that has better pay and full time instead of being part time at best buy, and they convinced me to stay by promising full time. Its been over a month since I had that conversation with one of my managers, and I've yet to see full time. They've actually cut my hours drastically compared to what part time I'm used to. I'm just done with the lying and being promised one thing and not seeing any results."
