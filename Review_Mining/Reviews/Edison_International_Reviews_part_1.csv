bad,"if you want to work with people that have no empathy what so ever, work your back off every day and night with a crazy schedule, under so much pressure and stressful environment, the managers think they are Gods, not caring workmates. and then they won't even hesitate to get you fired with no warnings or consultation or anything regardless of being having a family and kids and house payment. go work for this place and end up out in the street, the money is ok but what good is going to do if they let you go"
