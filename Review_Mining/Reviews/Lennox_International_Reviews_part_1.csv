rating,review
bad,Worst company to work for. High turnover rate idiotic upper management who don't understand people have lives. Barely room for advancement unless you're a member of the good ole' boys club. The district manager is a clown and the atmosphere is cut throat.
bad,"Anybody who values their career should not consider working for this company, it is a career killer.  Lack of advancement opportunities unless you check certain boxes, very prejudice company, bases hiring and advancement decisions on race and gender only."
bad,They lie about the hours you work. Micro manage you from start to finish of shift. The worst place I’ve ever worked at in my entire life. They don’t recognize you for your hard work at all.
bad,"Lennox is a case study for an in depth HBR story on a management strategy from the 1980's that refuses to accept the market place of today. Additionally, the corporate culture is of extreme harassment, verbal and mental intimidation, with promotion and advancement based on physical traits rather than sound management, team building and corporate culture. It will every be a ""Good to Great Company"" only a ""Bad to Worse One."" Stay away from any opportunity to work here, at all costs."
bad,"The harder you work the more they demand from you. This company does not care for its employees, unless management is dating said employee. Great place to work if you're a white male."
bad,If you are looking to work at lennox international a210 be prepared for management doing what they want to do. Certain ethnic back grounds getting to do what they want while the other ethnic group has to suffer. You go to humane resources and they take managements side with giving them a pass. So if you want to work there go for it but this is what to expect.
bad,Lots of drama there. The bosses will over work you if you let them. I was doing atleast 3 people jobs a night because there was not enough people on the line.
bad,Long hours  and bad management... no real off days or holidays no sick time off even with doctor excuse. The company just don’t care about their employees at all
bad,I would never recommend this place for work to anyone! Especially not in the CSS dept. One of the managers is the worst manager that I've ever worked for in my life!!!! The micro-managing & being treated like an elementary kid gets old. Being told what you're doing wrong several times a day but never told when you're doing good is a real bummer. Mangers have their favorites that they let get away with things and treat contractors like trash. I will be gone soon and never looking back!
bad,They treat people wrong unfair with pay. Unfair with the way they make us work we really don't paid for our time when we clock in 7 minutes early don't get paid
bad,This is a company that is more driven by a piece of paper (degree) than giving a person who has been there for 10+ yrs a chance. But want to use that person until they find someone with a degree that only ends up staying until they find a job making more money. Lennox does not care about its employees and does not take care of their employees. They low ball you even if you have a degree that is why their turn over rate or directors supervisors and managers is so high they will not pay... But you go to their competitor and sometime make 3x's as much than you will on Lennox.. This is not the company to work for at all. Here it is truly about who you know to get ahead.
bad,Training needs to updated by someone who is more in touch with how things work on the call center floor. It takes to long to be hired for a permanent position. Bonuses should no be taxed.
bad,It was okay working there I just hated how hot it was out there plus they didn't have any cameras it to many people getting there stuff stolen out there and they never did nothing about it some of the supervisors are very rude don't know how to talk to people
bad,Buckle up... You are in for one heck of a ridiculous ride. I don't even know were to begin. You will work like mad and will get paid squat. The company is so massive that you are a number. You are used and thrown away like a dirty paper plate. The work environment is just ludicrous. The rules are so silly you can only shake your head.
bad,"With such a high turn around rate and their policy for contractors, this is not a place to work. I would highly suggest you work anywhere but this particular company."
bad,"on call tech takes one call ,complains to manager,then your required "
bad,"You're hired as a vending machine tech.  You're only paid when you clock in and out at the customers address.  No inventory, expect to work on 5 to 45 package units with 1- 2 pole and 1- 3 pole contactor and no supply house within 50 miles. When there's no work there's no pay even when you're on call, and I was on call for over 300 days without back up. There are no  company discounts on equipment. When I tried to buy a system for my home, I  was accused of moon lighting. When I was asked to go out of town is was at a reduced pay without per diem."
bad,"No work life balance, terrible management, practices discrimination, hires based on race and gender instead of qualifications, racists throughout the company, no advancement opportunities, no training.  Do not go to work for Lennox if you want to move forward in your career.  I feel like I wasted the last six years of my life and career there, my stress levels were sky high, always nervous of when I would be next to go.  Going to prison would have advanced my career more than this place."
bad,Horrible working environment. They don't treat people fairly. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there. The management there is some of the worst I've ever seen. Floor manager don't know what to do or tell you the wrong things to do and alot of micro managing as well. No clear focus from the manager
bad,"Worked there 16 years, just to get laid off from lack of work. Hired 2 people in my department to replace me. They are laying off good people, just to replace them with new people. They do not care about people. They are cleaning house. There is no job security. They make up bogus stuff, so they can write you up. I went on vacation and got wrote up when I came back for parts shortages. They constantly are beating you down for things that are not your fault. Management makes bad mistakes and blames the employees. They cheated me out of 3 days vacation."
bad,"If you value your sanity and wish to be able to spend time with your family and friends, stay away from Lennox! They are constantly bombarding you with rules and regulations and you have to follow them down to the molecule. They are always watching you and you have to constantly be looking over your shoulder, not only for management but for your co-workers that they turn into ""moles""."
bad,Their female human resource recruiter is a witch who thinks she knows everything. She is rude and arrogrant. Who in the world uses their products anymore? Trane and Carrier are it!
bad,"manager is a moron. never had parts ordered correctly, consistently waited til last minute to run calls. Never took any of the blame for mistakes he caused. there is no room for advancement or a pay raise if you're not a kiss up or the managers bestfriend. Extremely biased manger. Expect to work weekends and long week days to no end. Manger has the attitude of a young female would rather lose a employee than lose an argument. WORST RUN COMPANY I HAVE EVER WORKED FOR."
bad,"Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto. If you are looking for a company with advancement Lennox is not for you. There is no room for growth, full time positions are nonexistent. HIGH TURN OVER RATE super high. Management and higher up don’t appreciate good workers especially the Brampton location. I regret even wasting my time even working there. 2019 the goal is to find a better company with no drama."
bad,"The Supply Chain teams for residential are very poorly managed and supported. Turn over rates are extremely high due to employee burn out, lack of support, and unrealistic expectations set by top management. This is not a good place to build a long-term career."
bad,"I can say that I have never been betrayed more by an employer than when I was employed by Lennox.  I worked insane hours, traveled constantly, and really invested in helping to launch a new endeavor.  I provided hard earned knowledge and insight, sage advice, and true sales leadership.  I wish I had known that the company was hopelessly stuck in 1980 and that the executive leadership serve only to protect their inner circles.  Research the turn over in this company and you will find that it is too high."
bad,"Entreprise sans évolution, environnement pas agréable, personnel non motivé et non performant, les gens qui glandent toute la journée sont mieux vu que ceux qui bossent,gros soucis de management dans cette boite faudrait tout restructurer, gros soucis de turn over, en retard !!"
bad,"Working this job for only a few months caused havoc on my body. i had cut hands, stiff back, aching feet, and stress. No real lunch time. You also deal with disrespectful bosses."
bad,"The ""All About Me"" culture is prevalent at Lennox. NO teamwork, collaboration, or reward for outstanding contributions. It is a shadow of the GREAT company it was a mere five years ago."
bad,"Language barrier was frustrating.  Was not treated like an equal or fairly. Pay was extremely low with no hope for raise, advancement or bonus. Office was freezing, most co-workers spoke another language and required translation. No advancement, no motive to stay."
bad,It was great working there.I had great supervisors that looked out for me but I was late a few times so I was fired. It taught me not to take work for granted.
bad,"Stressful work environment, coworkers will stab you in the back to make them look better.  Long stressful work hours and have little concern about your life besides work. Will not pay what your worth.  Management and most of the St louis crew has very little in field work experience. Will send you out of town  alot to make their numbers for the quarter. Consent changing rules."
bad,"Service Experts/ Lennox International is not a very good company to work for at all. The managers are very unorganized and unprofessional. This company has a lot, and I mean A LOT of growing to do especially with the leaders."
bad,"Long hours, high stress and not enough help.  They work you like a dog and never reward you. They don't care about your safety and you will be working alone a lot of the times.  No room for advancement unless you want to move to corporate."
bad,You have to work breath and live at Lennox in order to get anywhere. No matter how good of a worker you are they dont care they will push you around is all. The hours is definitely not worth the money you get. Especially if your willing to work your butt to have everyone else slack to get no incentive.
bad,"Career opportunities are non existent unless you are part of the buddy system. Management promotes based on friendships, where  education and experience doesn't count.  Management also changes policy on a whim."
bad,"Extremely Low wages by California's standards.  Training is bad, they will send you out to work on some equipment you have never seen before, and expect you to know how to repair it! "
bad,"I wouldn't advise no one to work on this shift. Buddy Buddy, and favortism at its best. Do not work in sheet metal on 3rd. It's pays okay, but the mental stress is not worth it. I've seen co workers have mental breakdowns on this shift, and had to be transported to the hospital. I repeat Do Not work in sheet metal"
bad,I was shocked to see how unprofessional an HR can be in a company of this size. work culture is good. Pay is average so as the management.Totally disorganized company which does not value employee time.
bad,Management lacks a clear vision except in profit motivation.  Lack of support by upper mgmt. makes daily tasks unrewarding.  Some good people there but generally most people just trying to a pay check and keep out of trouble.  Moving jobs out of the country.
bad,"Covering a wide territory and being continuously pushed to do more calls. Micromanaged.Having to take second seat to employees who are the pets of the boss. Efforts and achievements are not acknowledged but the rules of the game change continuous,y for the worse. Losing good accounts and having to reach quota by selling to smaller and less loyal accounts.To be used as a last resort and be gotten into without great expectations-workforce is continuously trimmed as we speak!"
bad,Not too bad a place for early career development. Avoid if you're at or above the manager level. Intensely political with constant executive blame gaming and sacrificing staff to cover their own mistakes. Limited ethics and values in place at the senior levels - it all about their bonuses.
bad,"Didn't get support from management .  Hardly received any help or encouragement.  The hours were ok and the benefits were ok, but the team work was lacking.  I would give team work a C."
bad,"Manager don't make a lot of money weekly,  they make money by bonus,  so they don't want to spend money in you or works, and want to kill you doing over time. Not matter the weather condition because more you do more they earn in the end of the year."
bad,"Lenexa KS, I would recommend not working at the parts counter, it's hard to work for the parts manager who has no personel experience or self respect."
bad,"Went to work for this company, with promises of cross training, and full time hours. After less than 10 days of ""training"", was ""thrown to the wolves"", and told the next day what all I did wrong. "
bad,"Take a hard pass when considering this place. They stand for everything opposite of what you should value and admire in a company. Corrupt, unscrupulous and dishonest on multiple levels. Toxic company culture. Stay away."
bad,"Stay away from the place. Favoritism, people are fired for workmans comp claim, bullies in management.  Work over 15 hours a day for nothing. My boss was fired for no reason - hardest worker I know."
bad,"I'm so mad for wasting my time with this unfair company. You have to be in one of the family's to get a promotion. Also if your manager don't like you no raise for you. They also reward bad work, also they put people in management that have no people skills. So keep looking you don't want to work here."
bad,"A typical work day is finding out at 7:30AM the night before where you will be going from your manager by a email. God forbid that something goes wrong with a unit on a 25 unit roof after the pm is done. Constant calls from the manager asking why the pm hasn't been completed after you have spent 2 hours driving to the location, 45 minutes hand lifting boxes of filter and equipment up onto a roof."
bad,"They will set you up to fail. coming from a past manager, take my advise, you will be lucky if you make it here 6 months. They go through branch managers every 6 months to a year."
bad,work wasn't horrible yet the pay was extremely horrible for the work i did. Start the day off with a brief meeting and then we got to work. I would make sure i had all my tools and the materials needed to start my day.
bad,A typical day at Lennox int truck comes  in  we unload the truck break down the product  scan the product in  and put it away. In the right location..
bad,Working at lennox has been a challenge. The management team at a210 side were i work have done everything they wanted to do while the workers get the short end of the stick.
bad,"When I was with the company, the turnover in management was horrific, and the support was not there.  Multiple meetings about treatment and everything and nothing changed.  I didn't realize how stressful it was until I left and started getting my life back.  I am grateful for some of the people that I met, but there is a lot of office politics, especially with management.  If you aren't one of their favorites, good luck trying to succeed.  They will keep pounding you to the ground and being negative.  Never did any team building exercises and made it a point to single out certain people for mistakes."
bad,"The technician floor is made up of gossip queens, old dudes who've worked there for 20+ years who b*tch and complain about how things have changed for the worst, and supervisors/management who are quick to blame others rather than owning their own mistakes. A decent co-worker here and there, but no camaraderie. Pay is low. HR and Engineer turnover rate is high."
bad,"Over the shoulder supervision, unsafe, not adquate amount of time for lunch breaks in comparison to the work load. The turn over rate was high so I had to train someone every week or two without reasonable pay."
bad,Company is only worried about bottom line. Slave drivers for little money. They want employees to be like robots. Alot of managers don't have HVAC skills or experience. Not client friendly company. Like to Rip off customers.
bad,"Worse company I've worked for.Management could careless about your family life.Pay is low compared to the rest of the service company's,if you don't mind working all the time, very little free time,you will fit in perfectly!"
bad,"Underpaid and overworked, 30+ consecutive days working, and you aren't paid for your knowledge and experience, same pay at 10 months as on day 1. Management does not care about their employees."
bad,"Lennox is a great company overall to be a part of, but the management system is horrible. I was hired on and promised two promotions, and after being told the job was mine nothing ever happened. The turnover rate is unlike any other place I’ve worked. Management tells employees what they want to hear, and not what’s true. Favoritism is shown to employees. Wouldn’t recommend anyone to this place."
bad,If people would just sjhut there mouths and quite  googing off at the majority of the time and also take responsibility for those own actions instead of constantly making up excuses trying to but the blame on someone else then I believe it might not be such a bad place to work.
bad,"Lacks employee empowerment, management has no clue how to demand plan (using archaic planning processes), resistant to change, lacks integrity & professionalism, favoritism practiced, Good Old Boys Club, Extremely High Turnover, Horrible Communication, Good systems poor configuration of the system, Poor Management all the way up the chain, never takes accountability for errors - blames employees."
bad,Talent Acquisition is a commodity deal..   Company keeps you on contract because the VP of Talent doesn't see value in Requitment or supporting the function.
bad,My day consist of lifting and using sheet metal to hydro and punch. At this job i have learned to read blue prints and punch and pierce. The management has a way of doing thierr own thing to me but they try and do well but not well enough to me. I enjoy working with my co-workers they help my day go smoother. Well the hardest part of job is really just getting there. I've learned to adjust to different types of jobs and invironments so no job is to hard to me. My most of enjoyable part is pay-day but really when the job i've done is recognized for excellents it makes me feel good.
bad,"Poor management at branches with little to no experience. Benefits are descent not good. Pay is under average scale over time is payed but not on weekends."
bad,Enjoy the fast-paced environment and meeting customer demands.  LII does not value their employees nearly as much as they sell through corporate-wide communication.  Leadership does not have full support from corporate decision-makers to implement changes that are in the best interest of the facility.
bad,The managment in the Springfield store is so far below profesional it is truly sad  he is  unethical and other things they will find out in due comming
bad,"Off load trucks, pick orders, load trucks.  Your normal day. "
bad,"company have  lot of room for improvement, there is not work balance with mandatory overtime after hours you know what time u get in but don't know what time would your day will be done."
bad,"Un environnement stressant du à un manque de process qui fait que tout le monde joue les pompiers. Pas de vision cible de la part du Management, des employés qui subissent mais ne sont pas moteurs. Des salaires faibles. Sinon les gens sont sympas."
bad,"you have to be a fast worker , also stay focused on what your job requires you to do .you also have to assemble parts to heaters and air conditioners."
bad,The Director at the time was unfair and mislead staff on many different fronts.  It was not a place of career growth.  They seldom promote from within.
bad,Lennox is a successful company with a written mission statement and culture that do not align with what is presented to its employees. Continued growth is based on preference NOT performance.
bad,I don't want to talk about it it's a long story and I don't think you want to hear about my long ol story about how I need a better job so can we please move on now
bad,I can not believe how poor training is and how complicated the computer system is. It is shocking. I keep thinking they will in the near future have to simply this system. THE turn over rate is shocking. Of the 12 people in my class there are only 5 left and that is only after 4 months. I really believe people leave do to the over whelming feeling you get from the poor training and the complicated computer system.
bad,Wasn't there long enough to experiance the full potential of the job due to being a temperary hire and only being there for a couple weeks.
bad,"Good place to work; however favoritism is a major problem. Example being, guy hired into the shop for 3rd shift. Within a year was given 1st shift crew leader position even though employee could never prove he knew how to work on equipment."
bad,"I've been working at Lennox for one week now, and all I have to say that it is one of the worst jobs I've had. 6 day work weeks with 9 hour shifts every day are incredibly tiring and leaving me unable to have much of a social life. I would not suggest working here unless you truly need the money."
bad,"a lot of negativity, training very poor. Management does not have much say. Company is up and down there's a lot of uncertainty of it's future."
bad,"From the surface, Lennox International is a great company to work for, our CEO mission statements resonate with me."
bad,"better training and room for career advancement, pay raise wasn't mentioned at all after the first year I worked there. Company can tend to play favoritism and that seems to be what qualifies a technician for proper training and pay raises."
bad,it was an okay place to work would have been better if there were more work avalible and if they did not send people home every other day. really enjoyed working with the crew
bad,"I can only speak to this location. It's a good ol' boy environment and women in leadership is not a very frequent occurrence. They do train well, safety is a focus, and there is plenty of opportunity to work overtime as an hourly employee. Wage increases occur automatically every 90 days until reaching top out. If you show up to do your job daily then your job is pretty much secure."
bad,"My core job responsibities are to open Lennox Parts Plus stores on time & on budget.  In so doing, I've learned how to create, implement & modify project plans as needed to achieve the desired results.  Lennox has good executive leadership in the Residential Business Unit.  It's a collaborative culture with some very nice people.  The most difficult part of my role is the lack of rewards for performance.  Meeting or exceeding business plan goals by opening the stores on time or early is the best part of the job."
bad,assembly line. I learned how to make parts. We had to work fast as a team. The hardest part of the job was the assembling line would not stop moving. The most enjoyable time was to go home.
bad,Buen ambiente de trabajo                                            las operaciones estaban sencilla y muy bien           el compañerismo bueno
bad,"The program is a sales training program. You will spend most of your time in one of their Parts Plus stores working as a counter sales (which means you will be lifting boxes, entering orders, and talking care of customers at the counter) associate while you learn about the industry and the company. They have a great sales training department and most of the people that work in the field are great hardworking people. You will also work as customer service representative (they call it inside sales but it is basically customer service). "
bad,"I'm A creative support professional with a record of increased responsibility. Proficient in prioritizing and completing tasks in a timely manner, yet flexible to multitask when necessary. Customer focused with diverse industry experience including insurance, publishing, non-profit and retail. Enjoys learning new programs and processes. A team player who is attentive to detail and able to work in a fast paced environment. Excellent oral and written communication skills."
bad,Next to never got to spend time with family hardly gave us a break it’s a very hot environment nonchalant environment people was ver mean in the office
good,"Lennox could be a way better company to work for. Not what i expected, for a company that carries Lennox name. Manager I was under did do everything the way it should have been done, and telling techs to mix refrigerants, and if your feeling dizzy go home, not to pass out on job."
good,"The overtime  ( 9 and 10 hour days )and days a week worked ( most times 7 ) are the key factors that I do not give a job with Lennox a favorable review .  I have no quality time for myself or my family , and I stay tired all the time , which is a safety risk on the job . This coupled with  a culture of poor management fuels my desire to not only change my career ,but relocate to another city as well ."
good,"An assembly line is a manufacturing process (often called a progressive assembly) in which parts (usually interchangeable parts) are added as the semi-finished assembly moves from workstation to workstation where the parts are added in sequence until the final assembly is produced. By mechanically moving the parts to the assembly work and moving the semi-finished assembly from work station to work station, a finished product can be assembled faster and with less labor than by having workers carry parts to a stationary piece for assembly."
good,They give you very nice benefits and some departments are nice to work in but some of the supervisors are hard to work for and all the new rules that they put in are too strict
good,"I'm going to be frank about this this place has many up and downs. So I'm going to list them off with the pros first then cons."
good,"A typical day at work would intel 800-2000 peices of metal being broke while running a punch machine, and a shear. High efficiency required, little to no down time."
good,It is a good workplace its just not where my heart is at. I love working with the elderly people that is where my passion is at. My passion is helping people.
good,Very high passed and stressful. no one has time for people or time to associate. dont take care of their own.Need more time to evaluate personnel. may miss lead workers
good,"They send you out to do service calls with an empty van, no supplies,  you have buy your own wire nuts and connectors, always running around getting need parts contractors, fuses, capacitors, belts,"
good,I learned to how to communicate with people and how to work as a team.
good,"great tools for dealers and process, but poor management coaching, favoritism. poor local store staffing model. minorities are often undervalued used , too many busy work process and desires to push the envelope as long as you do not get caught."
good,"I received constant harassment from all of the stressed out workers who were desperately trying to meet incentive, however, incentive was the same for night shift as well as day shift, and there were about half as many workers, so it was near impossible. It was the hardest I've worked for $10/h + overtime. At least overtime grants time and a half."
good,"Upper Management are truly out of touch with the day to day operations and challenges within it's employees and customers.  A lot sales associates carry more of the burden of operations than the managers and Out Side Salesman, which the Mangers all Receive 4 times the bonus of the Sales Associate who are truly the backbone of the facility."
good,"Pros: Job security, good (but not great) pay, nice coworkers, decent food in the cafeteria, good gym, career training, benefits."
good,"This company has two buildings one residential and one commercial. "
good,A good portion of the week is developing customer relationships and expressing the value proposition.  60% of the week is on the road working onsite with clients whereas the remaining 40% is working from home your home office.  Great flex hours and nice perk to have the company car that can be also used for personal use.
good,"I applied for a forklift operator...worked as an assembler 1yr. Took 3wks to get final paycheck, was accused of not turning in uniforms when i left. Never got total vacation pay owed."
good,Opportunity for advancement and the ability to be compensated above the average Account Manager role is a nice advantage. They provide you with the freedom to make local decisions and take care of the customers quickly.
good,"Decent company.  I was only hired for contract work, which is to their benefit in terms of offering benefits.  Very sales driven, which is not the career I would like to be in."
good,"Good to work in MRR - great coworkers, advancement opportunities, good entry level benefits"
good,"Senior executive leadership is great but middle leadership between manager and the EVP's doesn't have a clue throughout the whole org and more so in IT, HR etc."
good,a typical work day looks like; you pick an order they put out on the board. then you go find the items it asks for with your forklift. you put the items on a pallet and go shrink wrap them when you get them all. then you safely load them onto the correct truck; after  you safely secure it with the docloc and the chalks.
good,Lennox International is a great place to work for those that need money and don't mind being tired most of the weeks. Not reommended for young individuals that only want easy money.
good,"Great role starting off, but stagnant mobility and you will quickly hit a ceiling.  Many Lennox people are old school and hesitant to accept change.  Management is often poor and do not consider they're staff in decisions or providing staff with resources to complete their role responsibilities."
good,Lennox is a very easy job but to work there you must have patience it takes four years to top out you start at 9.00 thru a temp service (Ranstand USA) where you have to work 90 days to qualify to be considered for full time in most cases however you will work longer then 90 days meaning you will still be a temp making 9.00 a hr and it can go on for months once you are lucky enough to become full time youbagain have to wait 90 days before you receive any benfits ie another raise after that you will receive a raise every 90 days for 4 years topping you out at roughly 16.50 a hour you get no vacation days until your full time and you get the vacation time Jan 1st no matter how long you have been full time you start with 3 days and they slowly add more days the longer you stay there peak season runs from March through October normally but during normal times still be prepared for crazy hours 4am to 4pm today then 6 to 2 tomorrow lunch breaks are 20 mins unless you work a 10 hour shift or greater then you get a 30 min break but you aren't allowed to leave the lot on your break overall if you need have patience this can be a great job for you but if you are impatient or need some quick cash or a high paying job then this simply isn't for you
good,Great products and staff.  Excellent experiences and challenges
good,a typical days work starts at 7am. open the ticket logging software and assign calls.
good,"Hard people to work with. No training for the job, had to learn on my own. Management had no communcation with employees, just had write up sheets for you to sign."
good,"buen lugar para trabajar, buen compañerismo en las areas"
good,I had bad experience with one gentlemen but after waiting shifts I had no more problems. Overall good company with good benefits to work for. Nice place to work.
good,"answer calls all day. perform at a high level every day. some appreciation for customer service as a group/department,  but no merit-based advancement."
good,"Its an OK place to work sometimes if you can handle that type of environment. Plenty of overtime every single week, but its easy to get tired of the job and the people there."
good,It's a nice company with good work life balance. The work culture and environment is decent. Had opportunity to work with cutting edge technical and business experts.
good,"A typical day was fast pace trying to make sure the Customer and Outside Sale Reps.request are being handled in a timely manner. In this position you learned how to multi-task, pay attention to detail and organization skills.  I enjoyed helping our customers and helping our Sales Department to increase sales.  Lennox is a good place to work but I think if they could focus on the employees more and not Sales all the time. In my opinion, I think this will make this a great place to work."
good,Good company to work for as they provide good opportunities to grow your career. Will keep one busy with challenging projects and deadlines that are considerate to the amount of work involved.
good,it was an overall decent company to work for until the end of my time being there the work & my associates started getting difficult to work for. Race became a be part..
good,Une grosse boîte où il faut travailler sans trop s'investir pour être bien vu. Pas de réelle évolution possible juste des objectifs à remplir. Salaire non négociable
good,"Typical day is stressful, management is OK but heavily involved in politics. (management varies by personality). Work life balance is important but in my department is normal."
good,"Great environment, Great people to work with great location. Management had an open door policy which is always great for  a work location. I would go back to Lennox if I could."
good,"1. good vision and execution towards that vision in order to maintain industry advantage."
good,"Its Okay But Travel Is an issue , its not a professional work environment ,and could use some improvements on management skills for the supervisors"
good,Temporary position and term ended.  Very fast paced environment while assembling air conditioners. Long hours so endurance is needed to fulfill this role.
good,"It's a good place to work. I have learned a lot while working.  Management is pretty cool.  My co- workers make the day go by with great laughter. The hardest part of the job is staying cool in the heat. Again, my co-workers are the greatest."
good,my day at work can be a fun one if you do your job give your all there is a lot to building units and if you want to learn you can learn as much or as little as you want.  you have lots of people work with they are like family the hardest part of the job is getting behind and trying to get caught up the most enjoyable part is being caught up and staying that way
good,"There were many co-workers that I've come to know as friends. The company was very organized and patient with everyone, and they were very high-spirited about safety."
good,Great place to work but a lot of potential for improvement in terms of infrastructure and systems.
good,"Americaans bedrijf met productiefaciteiten in Spanje en Frankrijk."
good,I had tow jobs at this location. One was a Data Entry Clerk form 6:00 am - 12:00 noon then I was the Adminstrative Assist and Dispatcher for the Brank manager.I really enjoyed both postion. The Data Entry Job was mostly just that. Invoicing service tickets. The Administrative job I like because I was able to interact with customers and helped dispatched the technicians to the proper locations.
good,My review is since I start there 2 person was working in receiving just.they never finish there receiving write now I am working half day receiving and rest of day another job which is one man job for all day.
good,"Lennox - Stuttgart, Ar can be a rewarding career for CNC operators and assemblers that are interested in entry level positions. However, there are limited opportunities for internal growth because employees are typically long tenure therefore retirement seems to be the only means for others to advance."
good,"Dealt with customers, field service workers, and Salesman. Reviewed customer specs and worked with engineering to produce a product that followed that spec."
good,"Working at lennox was a great opportunity serving as the foundation of my career. Moving forward, I hope management reiterates and emphasizes the need for system and software improvement. Also, hours and work time should be more flexible to meet today’s standards."
good,The job very pushing to get job done. We had a number of units to need every day.They had good benefits. we have health and denial benefits. The employee had a discount there products.
good,Working for Lennox you knew your job was secured and it's a comfortable environment. My only problem was the simply fact that room for advancement was very minimum and that was my only issue.
good,It was an alright job the first few years I worked there. I enjoyed the people   I worked with but it just seemed like it was just so missed managed most of the time.
good,It basic job loading and unloading trucks the lack of good mangment evades there they make poor decisions.
good,"Unloaded loaded trucks "
good,"Esta empresa concerteza uma empresa que me ajudou muito em minha carreira profissional esta me projetando para o mercado de trabalho,porem uma empresa de medio porte.Nela tenho a liberdade e o poder de decição de alguns serviços,isso me empondo mais responsabilidade e poder.tenho um otimo relacionamento com os funcionarios."
good,"Learned new things working as a material handler even though I never had actual assignments."
good,One of the best companies to work for  with a forward thinking CEO. The managers are also wonderful and the people are very hard working. Overall great company.
good,"Les avantages:"
good,"The company is great in trying to promote new ideas and is a very much team-oriented culture. However, the structure and organization of management is unsettling, communication between departments is disconnected.  An evaluation of processes is much needed to improve many areas and enrichment in education should be required and provided when incorporating new systems.  This is a stable company and the one thing I enjoyed most is the team dynamic I had and how we were always encouraging one another."
good,"A nice company to work with. shouldnt fall a prey to the management crocs, who are actually very few of that kind."
good,"Financial analysis work. A lot of great people at the company, but a lot of disorganization as well. Company needs a bigger social component. People don't interact very much."
good,Lennox is a good place to work. You can learn how to operate many different kind of equipment. I was able to move around to a few lower departments and learn a lot. But when it came to advancing to a higher position it was about who you know I guess not about what you know.
good,"Lennox does not care too much about their employees. There are no real incentives to work there. After a mandatory layoff, I was given the work of two positions with no extra pay. I wasn't given any help when needed. The management there is very secretive and sneaky about what goes on with the company. The people are over worked and under paid and that's from hourly to salary."
good,"love the people, love the job and love working to make a difference. Need a better quality foundation to achieve a quality product on a regular basis. Precision has proved to be a great product that can deliver on time but at times will have small set backs that add up. Customer stay with this company, as they grow, they will learn."
good,A typical a day was ok.Management was snobish at best most co-workers were the same. The hardest part about this job was dealing with the snobish egos. The best part of the job was going home at the end of the day.
good,When you have a queue to yourself and get things done day to day work balance becomes manageable. Many new cases and task may be involved but you can handle most by asking the department you are working with for some help. Other indications for the job may be unclear because knowledge doesn't get passed around until it occurs.
good,Lennox is a great place for older people of 40plus. This company wants growth but the people here likes things to be the same. They barely hire contractor they want you to work like a real employee but not pay you like one.
good,"The job is good it pays the bills. "
good,"Every day at work is different.  I have learned to be flexible and resourceful in an effort to satisfy customers and resolve complex equipment issues."
good,fast paced place to move around in and learn different things in hvac assembly. ever changing schedule with lots of overtime during most of the year..
good,A typical day at work would begin with meeting with a manager to see where you are assigned to work that day. After that you are to get gloves and selves and report to that assignment. You are to do your job as fast as you can and keep up with your coworkers. The hardest part was when I was put on an assignment I struggled with and had to push threw the day. The most enjoyable part was the pay checks.
good,"I was hired due to my background with Lennox sales and repair. IIt was my first experience with 100% commission and I sailed. Sold $1,250,000 in my first full year and won multiple awards from Lennox Int. Eventually Lennox divested from their service side of the Corp and the new owners changed everything and tied my hands with options and higher pricing. My sales dropped and I left."
good,Everyday was a learning experience. New techniques and challenges are given daily to improve your performances. Co-workers were very helpful and team orientated.
good,"Gosto muito de trabalhar aqui, porque lidamos com equipamento industrial e os negócios são de elevados montantes."
good,This job was so up in the air-- we were all basically waiting for it to crumble. Poor management

good,"Balancing between professional and personal life is good."
good,Management is changing their opinion about the completeness of their product portfolio.  This should make for lucrative times in Lennox's history.  Lennox is a great company with a history of besting market performance expectations.
good,"The facitilty and people that worked at the plant were friendly, and they seemed like a family. the main thing that drove people away from the plant was the location. Stuttgart Arkansas isn't the greatest in the world, and can be at times full of mosquitos."
good,Good Learning. Great opportunity to learn multiple technologies and applications. Good Benefits. Employee Friendly. Can learn the business. Work life balance.

good,"Good place to work, but management is poor. work life balance is good. also local management do not take major decisions. requirements are not clear. no process followed"
good,"Monday-Friday is the best thing about the job. It is warehouse environment so it can get very hot or very cold. The pay is fair but could definitely be better. Supervisors care a lot about safety which is very good because the minor thing can cause a huge problem. Growth opportunities are not there, if you start as a warehouse associate you probably will be doing the same thing for years to come. It can get busy during the year and you will end up working a couple of hours of overtime but its not super regular."
good,I was free to learn and grow in the company. Such as achieve my Lean Bronze certification. I am probably the only regular full-time associate to earn that title.
good,Lennox is a decent job  can’t actually complain. It’s fast paced th  employees are nice th  managers are as well but they don’t actually help you. It’s very easy to understand the requirements there.

good,"Company reputed as home of the never-ending contract because large percentage of the workforce is contractors. In spite of that, lots of company veterans who have been there 20-30 years. In some ways this is great, but in other ways, higher level executives are prone to nepotism and haven't kept their knowledge of marketing technology and practices up to date."
good,"Typical work day: about two hours of meetings with 4-5 hours of individual work"
good,"Fast paced,everyday something new is learned."
