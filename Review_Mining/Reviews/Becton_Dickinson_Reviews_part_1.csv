bad,"Der Täter wurde nicht sanktioniert, viel mehr noch vom leadership gefeiert. Er tat es in der Öffentlichkeit, in Anwesenheit der Kunden und Zivilisten, die Aussage der mutigen Kollegin wurde durch Ethikkomission manipuliert, der Sales Manager drehte im gleichen Moment als er sah was sein ""best buddy"" tat, den Kopf damit er später für ihn lügen kann. Die Business Managerin übte später Druck auf die Geschädigte sie solle ihren Strafnatrag zurückziehen. Staatsanwaltschaft sah die Schuld als erwiesen und stufte es als ""geringes Vergehen"", belehrte und verwarnte den Täter. Für die Firma immer noch kein Schuldbeweis! Der Täter wird noch bei Tagungen gefeiert. Die Geschädigte wurde vor der versammelten Mannschaft von der Business Managerin öffentlich diffamiert und der falschen Tatsachen beschuldigt und verhielt sich gesetzeswidrig im sinne der Verleumdung. "
bad,I couldn't wait to get out of this definition of a dead end job. No opportunity for advancement  or raise. No matter how hard you work. Not to mention no transparency. They will use you for a year then let you go.
bad,"Team leaders attitude towards lower paid staff is horrendous, if you stand up for what you think is right and not what they think is right they will make up excuses to get you fired, there is alot of backstabbing and malicious behaviour with colleagues, and also staff are known to do alot of gross misconduct, physical harrassment and assault towards female co workers."
bad,"Company only cares about profit.  Management horrible. Disrespectful, toxic behavior is allowed & rewarded. Real job TRAINING/mentoring doesn't exist."
bad,Working here was like being back in highschool with people 18 and up don’t work here I wouldn’t recommend to no one they don’t care about you and they don’t like new people they talk about you behind your back just a bunch of unnecessary drama
bad,"There was high turn over rate when I started. Typical shared services environment. Management plays the "" we inherited this mess "" and behind closed doors blames the very employees that always get them out of their binds. There continues to be high a high turnover rate as the new finance director is infuriating and/or alienating everyone until they leave (cleaning house) I would not recommend this place to my enemies!"
bad,There was no enjoyable part at working for BD. I didn't like the management style because they like to micromanage. The hardest part was learning new software.
bad,"BD is a horrible place to work. The management suck, the pay sucks and there is no HR. Everything is corporate now. They hire felons and the people who work there will drain the life out of you. Way to much drama, and way to many fake people. Very hostile environment, and all around a waste of over 9 years of my life."
bad,"The management have no place in management. poor communication skills, They are not true leaders.They care more about quantity then quality. It is a shame because this place had so much potential. They also let people go that had been with the company for over 15 years just to save money."
bad,"I am not a christian, I was pushed around and picked on until I stood up for myself and then Human Resources punished me for the act of self preservation and I was eventually forced to look for new opportunities. The Broken Bow Location was very difficult to live in as a non-local or a transplant from outside that small town's citizenry. Do not move in from of out the region they are very 1950s oriented."
bad,They offer no help to those that are injured on the job. You are given vacation time but expected to use it during their shutdown times. The pay is the only good thing about that place
bad,"The company only cares for number, the employees are nothing to them, they will work you until you literally can’t no more, do yourself a favor and look somewhere else, also there is no privacy for personal life everyone knows everything about each other"
bad,Would not recommend - it's a hot mess.  More layoffs consistently each year.  Morale very low and you never know when it's your turn.  Amenities are nice and it's in a great location but that's about it.
bad,I basically have nothing great to say. This company underpays you and overworks a person. The company only cares about productivity and nothing else. Manager is like watch dogs.
bad,"I was working with BD for almost 2 years implementing start 2016 end 2018 , "
bad,"Au sein du service commercial aucune communication , tous le monde se tire dans les pattes."
bad,"If I could I would give a big fat flippn zero! Don’t get me started or we’ll be here for eternity! Fake bake bosses, annoyed co workers that don’t shut the flip up and just spew toxicity all over the place!!!!"
bad,"This company is completely about the brand and has no appreciation for the people behind it. "
bad,"Management makes promises and do not deliver the promises.   Very bad attitude"
bad,Expect annual layoffs every year in October. Working with entrenched employees who are trying to save their jobs by looking / acting important.  Of course management could care less.  Internal teams can not innovate when the top talent is leaving for better jobs.  BD is currently run by MBAs with the Worldcom / Enron approach to acquisitions of other company's. Every year they buy a company and fire employees to make the balance sheet look good at the detriment of future growth of the company purchased.
bad,in mfg pro the supervisor never knows whats going on. You have people who come to work on a daily basis and never does any work. they are the ones who is constantly laughing with the boss. When you first get there they are going to act as if you are golden because they want you to feel welcomed. then after 3-4 months nothing you do is enough. the only thing they care about is the job getting done. they dont care if you die  behind it. after i quit working there my stress level went away and my happiness came back. you will never have a set schedule . the time to come in changes everyday and you never know when you go home. be prepared to sell your soul to this sorry company.
bad,This company is Totally Bias and Racist don't work here unless you enjoy being treated unfairly training needs to be revamped and when your done with training management needs to make sure the things we learn in training are put into practice immediately for everyone in training not just the people you think might make it everyone should be treated equally and have the same opportunity.
bad,"Fast past work environment."
bad,"Corrupt management, click type atmosphere. Abusive unprofessional management. Professional people should stay away as far possible.I have been driven out of the job after three years of hard work. Did not sue because it would have been an uphill battle. The abused three people and drove out of the job in less than a year. Threatening and extremely abusive place to work."
bad,They would do anything to get their bottom line numbers including every year cutting good people and offering the worst medical program in the industry.
bad,At this job the lead ppl show favoritism to certain employees. The lead/supervisors will throw you under the bus if it keeps them in the clear. They will ask you a question and tell you how to answer. If you dont answer how they want they will find a reason to fire you. The ppl that i worked with were some good ppl. But like any job there is always those coworkers that you want to choke because they think they know everything.
bad,"The Northern California team I was a part of had many problems. Mostly it was  the egos from the other team members and their inability to share their knowledge with the new comers or their other coworkers who where not part of the ""in crowd."" The unprofessional-ism of some of the female analyst was baffling.I found it hard to believe that this team was even successful, but then again it's not like any of the team members where actually friends."
bad,"I would not recommend this company to work for or with. What else could I say, management was awful and  most co-workers were subpar individuals. Made a few good friends."
bad,Terrible place to work. The management is unwilling to work with you and they consistently let you know that you are replaceable as a contractor. This company a terrible place to start a your career at.
bad,"Not a good place to work, cutthroat environment,"
bad,Job has No growth potential. The company cares very little about their employees. Leads and management show no concern about employees. Lack of communication. Poor management. Under paid. Not appreciated
bad,I was hired as a line lead from the outs  the long time employees where unable to handle someone from the out coming in and working circles around them .They complain to management management knows nothing about keeping good workers they lie and let you go over stupid stuff their company logo is false they are not honest they are not fair I would never recommend this company to anyone they work you tons and give you credit for nothing
bad,"The most dysfunctional place I have ever worked. Managment is horrible, not experienced. This office is developing applications for a specific disease that nobody understands or is educated in, yet they believe they are pros in the subject material. Never in my life did I think that my experience working at BD would be as horrible as it was. I would strongly advise anyone looking to pass on any offers, and find another place to work. Turn over is epic, literally, amazing, you can watch people coming and going daily!"
bad,"No one higher up than  you will listen to any feedback because you are just a lowly pion. Work flow and the amount you do an hour is heavily viewed, not just by supervisors but coworkers as well"
bad,"The worst place I have ever worked. The company does not care about its employees at all. They work you long hours and do not pay well at all. They expect everything from you, but they will do very little in return."
bad,Management makes people work crazy hours. 12 hour shifts and makes people work mandatory overtime for 12 hours on their scheduled day off. Management doesn't care about their employees and only cares about the numbers they produce.
bad,"If you want to be treated like cattle,  go ahead.  management is the be all end all.  If you don't kiss the back end of them  you wont work there long.   Lay offs,  poor pay"
bad,Upper management was terrible and cared more about bonuses than the quality of the product or employee well being. Quality over quantity. Scary stuff.
bad,"It is a great place to work, people are very cooperative and nice. Unfortunately the warehouse is shutting down. I will miss the people and easy work days running the machines, but it is time to move on."
bad,"This place is awful and is filled with constant drama. There is absolutely no professional atomsphere and the management is useless, majority of the time they feed into the drama too. You can find a better job with the little pay you make here especially when pay is maxed out around $15 and there's people who've worked there for 20+ years and that's all they make. It doesn't matter how good of a job you do, you don't get recognized for it and you definitely don't get a pay increase."
bad,Each day we would assemble medical trays for sugerys. Everything had to be sterial we had to wear hairnets and cover our clothes and shoes. Co workers were extremly rude. No one talked to me the whole time I was there and i make friends easy.
bad,My immediate supervisor was absolutely horrible from the outset and it never improved even after I brought it to the attention of our manager.
bad,Provide technical support to customers along with implement projects as well. I don't feel talking about employer is really a good idea in this format.
bad,"Lots of work to do because simple works is made complicated."
bad,This location is run by floor associates and not by true leadership. You are held to incomprehensible deadlines not set by you but by managers that think when the projects should done. 5 Million dollar projects are not accomplished in 3 months!
bad,If you have a picture perfect life and don't mind being spoken to like an animal then it might be a good place to work but for those of us who are regular people with everyday struggles in today's society it isn't the kind of place you want to be
bad,This was a new experience for me at Carefusion and i learned alot about injection molding. Good co workers and management.
bad,Great workplace and people.  I have nothing bad to say about the company.  My contract ended during the budget freeze of the company.  That is the only reason why I am no longer working there.
bad,"Very productive, nice operation, overtime, bonuses. Training was very through. Great teamwork."
bad,Strong in the syringe business but do not follow EEOC guidelines at all.
bad,"Management gets paid big bonuses for production.  It is all they care about and will purposefully break rules, laws, and policies to disobey quality and safety standards and get more parts out.  They will outright lie and create false documentation to cover it up.  Any body that point it out will be made miserable until they leave or HR will make up lies to get them terminated."
bad,"Hired and parked.  Not much more than that.  Lots of infighting and back stabbing.  Leadership is non existent, they needed to fill a role I filled it and they never asked me how things are and what can they do to help me succeed."
bad,"The RCI site has a lot of potential and there are many great employees but serious problems exist at a management and HR level. Problems are swept under the rug causing morale to suffer. A few changes within Senior management and HR department would make a big difference"
bad,"The Liberator Medical Supply/Bard branch of BD in Stuart is so poorly managed, I'm not surprised it keeps changing hands of ownership. The departments that seemed to be managed well (or least ok) have been brought down as one unqualified, but over confident, AR rep started climbing the management ladder. Everything is now unorganized."
bad,"About time he left.  Completely destroyed the functioning R&D teams.  Reduce the leadership from 9 to 3.  People had zero faith in the VP.   "
bad,"Stay away! Horrendous management. Ridiculous expectations. Most of the equipment at the plant is old and outdated. There’s lots of favoritism! Unless you are a tech, supervisor or cell lead expect to work like a dog. Only upside, there’s plenty of OT. Currently looking for employment elsewhere."
bad,Poor leadership in kitting department. No respect for employees.Absolutely no kind of growth.Its a dead end job with no security or benefits. Supervisor allow the lead to lead him. She tells him how to run the department. Very out-dated material used for the jobs. Needs a very drastic upgrade.
bad,Only a good place to work if you only like people from the deep south that are scared of diversity.  Management changes every 6 months and they do not like to promote from within.
bad,"Do not work here, this company ignores complaints of bullying and misconduct. They also blatantly abuse zero hour contracts, they employ you to work twelve hour shifts then let you go with no notice!"
bad,"Was in training and didn't make it to the floor. It was all remarkably silly. From what I observed, I knew I was right in keeping my job search active:"
bad,I liked the work they were very attentive my supervisor was very attentive and servisal
bad,"Minimal training, Huge responsibility in the field. No overtime, many hours of voluntary work performed to complete project. Favoritism is alive and well here in the remediation team."
bad,"""We help all people live healthy lives"" is what they claim to be their motto, but they left out the part UNLESS you are a BD employee. If you have car trouble and over an hour late it counts the same as night coming at all: so might as well just take an entire day."
bad,"Do not work here !  This is an old fashioned company that is run by small cliques of people that have been there for years.   Your performance does not matter, only that you fit into a very narrow mold of what people are supposed to be. There is no diversity of ideas or thinking.  There is a very high turnover rate because they treat their people so badly.  HR has no power or ability to deal with employee issues."
bad,upgrading hardware. when upgrade to new computer data must be migrated from old computer to new computer this task was easy when computer was local. most of the computers were not local most were in the field therefore there had to be a VPN connection and the end user would not leave it connect to allow the data to be moved to the new machine.
bad,Very toxic and chaotic atmosphere. Would not recommend anyone to work there. They seem to hire a bunch of people all the time and then lay-off a whole bunch.
bad,"Manager was a back stabber and encouraged in-fighting. The senior members and deaf girl in the billing department were cut throat and clicky. Team Lead was terrific and motivating. She was a true asset to the company. Pay is decent, but you will have no outside life due to 6 day work weeks and leaving on time is frowned upon. Training was good because the trainer was awesome. My advice would be..trust NO ONE and stick to yourself. They'll smile at your face, then report anything to the lousy manager. Drama queens"
bad,"It's a shame after all they train/encourage that when you don't work out in a particular department, they do not make an effort to bring you into another department that might work better if you are a good worker otherwise."
bad,"they couldnt wait for me to come back.   I was out on workers comp. and they called me to tell me that my position was terminated and that the reason they let me go was because of fmla for migraine and vertigo.  These reasons had nothing to do with the elbow surgery that I had done for the torn tendon.  Never mind the seven years of service to the company, never mind the 68 hours a week I was working before that.  Thanks for nothing."
bad,"I was responsible for production of packaging, manuals, labels. I worked under a Senior Graphic Designer, and he was unfriendly, unhelpful, uncooperative, unprofessional."
bad,Management at BD usually has someone in mind before they post a job.  Management is very closed minded.  BD's doesn't promote from within much.  Negative morale.
bad,"Overall I have nothing good to say about C. R. Bard in Tempe, AZ. As long as the executive staff got their enormous bonuses at the end of the year the work was tolerable. When C. R. Bard took over company, profit sharing and any other good thing for production/facility staff was eliminated."
bad,"A spin off from Cardinal Health, this company has a very confusing business model, poor leadership (San Diego yahoos), and terrible organization. Very unprofessional people worked at this place, which is sad for those who really tried to make something of the company. Amateur hour if not bush league for this place."
bad,"Typical good ole boy culture. Managers are married to VP's, nepotism reigns. Zero job security with rumors of layoffs constantly."
bad,I left BD because a male manager made me feel uncomfortable. I was sitting at my desk and he came up and slammed his hand on my desk and I thought that was a very disrespectful and aggressive behavior for a person in a work environment.
bad,"Pros"
bad,"They will tell you 1-2 nights travel, It turns into 5-6 nights travel every week. They will tell you you have a certain geography and then it turns into your covering all US without any additional compensation. Besides doing Education you will end up doing a lot of the project managers work?? Dont think about questioning any policies because the retaliation from the managers is brutal ( They are worried info will get passed onto their bosses) . Your name will then be spoken amongst all the managers  t/o the US and you will be known as a trouble maker. They find ways and reasons to NOT give you an Annual salary increase and or any bonus. If you happen to up sell on any account for any additional modules, Forget it... you dont get a PENNY but who does... the salesperson thats not even their anymore. Work your butt off, travel your butt off, do your work and the PM's work. If you have a family or grand kids... forget about them... you wont see them anymore.  I have actually witnessed a manager speaking with a potential new hire stating travel is only 1-2 nights per week  LIES LIES LIES!! Just be honest with people.. you eventually find out the truth and then your stuck in the job because then it looks like your job hopping. They get their claws in you and then make you suffer with unappreciated and tireless travel and work, When you get back to your hotel after your done working at the hospital all day or evening and also night shift...OH NO you don't, your not relaxing  or sleeping after a hard day at the hospital 8-10 hrs,( Standing the whole time educating ) Its now time to"
bad,turn over rate is a joke can't keep operators cause the start pay  is bad and the benefits are mediocre. the management doesn't see the talent and lets good people leave
bad,learned a lot about medical repairs traveled a lot but no job security and management can careless about you also no room to grow unless you do things for people against your will.
bad,"Prior to the Private Equity firm take over, the company had limitations, however it was nowhere close to what it has become present day. Everyday it is a constant fear of layoffs, the morale is at an all time low, and they have stopped everyone and everything involving innovation."
bad,"I was working there from 2014-2016. The first few months of working there was amazing. Everyone would work as a team and when someone needed help, it was given right away. Until new managers were hired. This is when everything went down hill. Some employees noticed things not being the same (special treatments) and started to bully other co-workers. No one wanted to do any work and the company was bought out by another company. Many changes and not much guidance. Lots of people were laid off and after having severance, we no longer had insurance which we were told we would because the new company didn't transfer our information over so the people who were laid off, when needing to see their doctors, couldn't because THEY, the company, messed up. Most employees who were laid off didn't have insurance for over 2 months. Like i said in the beginning. This company had such a wonderful work environment, the people were hardworking and it was a great place to work. Can't say its the same now."
bad,They pay starting out isn't worth it for the amount of work. Most of the time treated poorly even when your a hard worker and do everything your supposed to do. Poor attitudes by most making it an unfriendly negative work place. Honestly I would never work there again not because of the job because of the people.
bad,Poor management and training. Pay is low and the environment is negative and stressful. If you aren't a pet you're on the chopping block. Most employees are nice and helpful but management can be nasty and unprofessional. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. No room for advancement.
bad,I cannot work for a place that places no value on family.  I did my job well but the mental atomosphere is impossible.  As my title states you are only a number.
bad,I enjoyed working here because of my co worker their friendly and very cultural people.
bad,I have no comments to make about this company.
bad,"Company was purchased by BD, culture change .  Poor management.  Not Veteran friendly.  Purchases other companies and hire employees abroad to layoff US workers."
bad,it was great place to work in terms of my team and my boss who were very supportive very knowledgeable in their field.I enjoyed working at BD. I'll definitely recommend this company.
bad,Terrible management and communication between employees and other departments and people. They treat employees terrible with no respect or compassion or teamwork
bad,"Management is a severe problem here. Nepotism, ignorance and decay are everywhere. They would rather hire two lousy employees than one good one. They would rather hire two friends or family members than one outsider. They like the ability to control their employees, hate innovation and don't care much about ethics or hard work. They have no problem stealing credit for other people's work and will say all the right things when you need to hear them. When it comes time to deliver though, they will NOT support you and there is no room for career growth unless you are related. They would have to double my best offer for me to ever go back there."
bad,"My review is for the not knowing of this company's culture in Madison and Covington. African Americans do not have the same opportunities as those of the whites for career jobs. Majority of the African Americans at both sites either work in warehousing or production. Corporate needs to revamp managment, ASAP. Also, the sad think about this, is that I am a Caucasian male."
bad,poor management with recent merger they still have not fully integrated into BD's  system.  I feel the culture at BD is much better than the culture at  Bard which I describe as a good boys club.  The salary and compensation is the best in the industry and I was well compensated
bad,"Gave them 15 years.... took the human out of human resources. Everything became automated...not what I signed up for. Lost sight of the people.  Understand in a business; however, people are the most valuable resource and they could  care less about the people."
bad,"I watched so many good people in this company get canned simply because the missed more than 40 hours of work in a year.  No excuses for snow, family emergencies,  illness, etc.  Either you use your vacation time or else it gets counted against you.  I have never worked in such a cutthroat backstabbing s-hole in my life.  Only good thing was the pay, but with all the bull you have to go through in this place, it is not worth it.  I got screwed out of my bonus because magically they happened to not get a test that was supposed to be turned in.  I know for a fact it was turned in.  Accused me of things I didn't do, and after it was proven I didn't, the manager who made the accusations never even had the decency to apologize.   Many employees were so thin skinned that if they could possibly be offended by something,  they would turn you in and management would always bring up their ""core values"" policy.  This company has no values.  Worst place ever."
bad,All sorts of people being let go. Some had many years of dedication and were let go. The company uses temp employees hired by a temp agency and very little chance of getting hired by the company itself. As a temp you have no benefits at all and they can let you go for any reason what so ever.
bad,This is just for The office in San Diego. The pimp aka ***hol3 who runs the show is playing politics and promoting people with no sense of performance reviews and the works they have done. More over this person Outsourcing  everything to the max So this jerk can claim his shaitty credits with BD goal. while we worker bees are doing all the hard work and overtime get the positions outsource. Good job For putting this dumb butt person in management guys. Well done keep doing the good job.
bad,The management Is terrible. The team leaders don't care about anything but themselves. Supervisors lie to you and tell you they are going to do something and don't do it. One main supervisor doesn't know a thing runs and hides every time a quote big wig shows up. Has no knowledge of the department he is suppose to be running. Human Resources is terrible very unprofessional and rude has a very nasty attitude. They allow those that have been there for years to get away with anything including threating other employees with violence and talk to people any kind of way. Just not a very good place to work. One set of rules for those they like and those they don't. doesn't matter how good you do your job or show up everyday. They good people that work their are always looked down on.
bad,"I learned a huge amount working there.  All of the plant utilities were in an unmaintained state leading to huge amounts of downtime.  It was a hard fight to get these projects funded.  "
bad,"Zero leadership within my former department. Worst IT department in the history of the world. Chaos and cattiness among women. Most boring, stagnant, silent office I’ve ever worked in— zero signs of life. I couldn’t get out of here fast enough. Genuinely the most toxic workplace I’ve ever worked in, unless you enjoy being picked on by executive admins for your clothing, hair, and other things not related to your work performance."
bad,Management is not on the same page. Overtime is ridiculous I get it every year and every year it’s months at a time! Saturday work schedule is every Saturday but once a month they actually allow you to have time with your family! They also believe that whatever line your on that the overtime is all on you unless they decide that they like you enough to make others help you with the mandatory overtime. Like I said doing for some and not for all. There are too many people walking around the room doing what they want when they want and the supervision is nonexistent!
bad,"Not an awful place to work.  It is a typical call center environment. Work environment is somewhat hostile.  Bullying among employees are not taken very seriously. Majority employees have been there for years and just come to work, do their job and go home.  Not looking to advance in any way.  Pay seems to stay the same even though they have been there for years."
bad,"I operated 2 packaging machines at the same time. these machines jammed up and  broke down constantly, and we got no time off even on holidays. Because it was a medical manufacturing facility, there was No time off at all."
bad,"Due to the closing of sections of the plant, and hired through a temp- agency I was laid off after 3 weeks."
bad,Company moved jobs to Mexico and China. We had to lay off over 100 employees. Not fun. Now the jobs are in Mexico with people who dont even have the expertiece to do the job.
bad,"Toxic environment."
bad,Not enough techs for the workload. Techs abandoning ship in droves due to lousy working conditions. Bad management. Low morale. Pursue at your own risk.
bad,"The company has a great mission.  However, the mission is clearly not communicated well to the employees; because their actions are not in line with the mission.  The company is still in the dark ages; behind in all aspects from their main competitors and even smaller corporations."
bad,"So I have been wanting to work for this company since 2015, I finally got a chance just to be disappointed. The mangers are messy , they talk about employees, favoritism, always giving there work to there customer service reps so they can go around and talk about everybody , they let me go with no reason, my attendance was great , quality , and productivity was at 100% I get a call at 11 at night stating my assignment ended with no reason. What a way to mess with peoples lively hood for no reason. Not to mention I got a call stating I was in the October list to be hired on after the hire freeze lifts, but the next day I get let go. This company has a high turn over rate because of there management, if they got responsible people in that business it would be more successful."
bad,"The employees are the best part of Bard. They encouraged me, gave me the training from their experience. The problrm: every employee had their own way of performing the job. It made it difficult to adapt. The management of training is nonexistent. They need to specify one consistent trainer & one way teaching how to perform the job."
bad,"learned how to drive an turrett truck,and be an leader and put myself in the customer shoes,etc.very neat and clean building,some coworkers wee cool and trained correctly,the management use to care about the people,the moral dropped.job will be stressed @ times as well,especially during month end."
bad,"Yearly layoffs were the norm, but outsourcing to India of IT and most administrative functions has added to those numbers.  Job security is zero, employees are no longer valued, and morale is low.  It's sad to see what BD has become."
bad,My work day consist of picking orders to be scanned and shipped to different customers. In the 5 years of working for this company I have done a verity of jobs which did help me to learn and get more experience within the company. The management in my personal opinion are not professional.
bad,"In this company is who you know not what you know , a lot of favoritism and don’t appreciate what you do for them when they need you. If you have a friend in offices you are safe when you do something bad"
bad,"I received an email from Company's recruiter to schedule a phone interview for a position I had applied for. We agreed to a specific date and time. When the time came, no call! After about 15 minutes, I emailed the recruiter to ensure she had my correct phone number. She replied that they were cancelling the interview as they had changed their mind. However, they didn't have the courtesy to actually cancel the interview. Instead, I was ""stood up!"" Very unprofessional behavior on the Company and its recruiter's part."
bad,"Poor management, no room for advancement, and no time for family. Worked as a order picker for three years, and I saw 4 different supervisos come and go! when hired permanent I was making the same pay as someone that had been there for 30 years!!!!!"
bad,"Un dia normal..con mucho trabajo,,aprendi a desarrollarme como ingeniero en los departamentos de ingenieria de manufactura e industrial asi como autilizar los diferentes sistemas de para los cambios de manufactura y validaciones,,en cuanto la direccion con gerencia es algo especial,,dependiendo de las actitudes de las personas,, con los colegas de trabajo un excelente ambiente.Lo que mas me gusto de mi trabajo es estar activo siempre y desarrollar proyectos destacados."
bad,"Los gerentes son muy prepotentes , tuve la mala experiencia de trabajar para una gerente la cual trataba a todo el personal con gritos y regaños delante de los clientes , pase el reporte a RH y jamás hicieron nada "
bad,Es un proceso que tiene por objeto determinar en qué medida se han logrado los objetivos previamente...
bad,Management is getting lower and lower profile every year. Some workers are get promoted if high level managers fall in love with his/her employee. People get married with their employees and get promoted easily. BD became a farm. No friendly working place at all. HR and high level managers manupilates head quarters of the company.
bad,Sin comentarios.Prefiero no comentar nada de esta empresa.
bad,"Management style was very poor, colleagues very critical and difficult to work and extremely hostile, bullying is common place and not challenged by management"
bad,"You are hired in through a temp service and told you have a chance of perm. position after 90 days (most of those that were hired had to wait at least 18 months). No benefits, holiday pay, or sick pay unless you were hired perm. They shut down for the week during Christmas and if you aren't a perm employee you do not get paid for the days during shut down. "

bad,"Good work place long process to go from temp to hire, once hired there is a chance for growth co workers are friendly. I beleive they have more temps than permanent employees."
bad,"The production goal was too high. The production managers do not understand the pain the assemblers are going through. When you're near the target of 125 units, the production managers are quick to rush you to build 180 units. Most assemblers would wake up unable to move their fingers and after reporting your injury they just let you go just like that. They highly discourage labor unions and fear was instilled with the assemblers on the floor because majority are immigrants that are stuck with ""It pays the bills"""
bad,management is terrible and hours are terrible almost impossible to take time off and advancement does not exist 80% of the workers do not speak English and cannot have proper communication skills.

bad,"My routing number is correct and I get paid for what I work.  I spend a great deal of time traveling to do this job.  It is a reliable, good paycheck."
bad,I do my job to the best of my ability and if I can help out other I would. The hardest part was the scheduling when comes to employs far as u may have to work overtime with short notice.
bad,"Assembly line workers here are stressed to the max. The constant stress to produce more and take on a higher work load by (line balances) all while NOT prepping is insane. All while receiving a measly $12/ hour. They are told that their  job is critical to our costumers, that they are so important, but yet we pay them poorly and treat them like worker ants that are laid off at the drop of a hat and replaced two seconds later. "
bad,"Historically, the Leader of this team was not experienced and did not take responsibility for bad decisions. There was also obvious favoritism, promoting only 2 individuals who were loyal. Recent changes may bring improvements as the executive manager has been reassigned and one of the loyal subjects has retired. New leadership may result in positive changes for Clinical and Medical Affairs team. Time will tell."
bad,the job is a fast paced job you are always on the go and at any given moment you can be told to go and do something else that you would need to stop what you are doing and go to another area and do what is asked of you. you must always be able to know what your documents are located at so that if you have an issue you have to be able to solve it right away. I love working with my coworkers we all get along and we are always there to help one another. I like the fact that every day is a new day and that it will never be the same as yesterday.
bad,"If you aren't in tight with the upper echelon management, you won't be anything more than support staff. Raises are not given based upon performance without you having to ask for them, and then you must of course interview and explain WHY you think you deserve a raise."
bad,"If you do get promoted, you make the same as when you were on the phone, no one can ever accurately explain the bonus scale. So basically, you get what they give you..which isn't much. Management is a club, and if you aren't in the club (males only) or dating one of them, you are treated as second class...if you are in the club, you can do anything to anyone and still be sitting pretty..witnessed several remarks to emplpyees about race, weight and size of bra from management, nothing done..not a thing"
bad,"Working 12 hour days in an extremely hot (90+) and stuffy environment with an impossible workload was a normal workday in the Canaan plant.  The molding department is by far the epitome of dysfunction in Canaan. "

bad,It is ok to work for this company if you are a college student in transitionOk to work for younger people.The chance of advancement is very small. As the management structure is completely different than most company.
bad,did not enjoy working here to many chiefs not enough indians as they say. good pay but bad management left many staff unhappy.
bad,"I don't have much positive to say... Most co-workers were very nice and hard working people and I liked my immediate supervisor.The trainning was decent."
bad,"Le pouvoir par 2 managers (sans compétences), déplorable qui font leur propre loi."
bad,"So the temps they hire have more job security than an actually BD employee.  Such as they can make their own schedule and come in when they want but if you so much as have a bowel movement on the clock it's points, yeah a point system.  They also change your schedule at a moments notice, thought you had to come in at 10, nope come in two hours early and its mandatory if you're not on time the its points!"
bad,"Management only cares about them self,  they want there bonus...if they don't care about you they will set you up to get fired...they keep moving you around to different machines with no training and ask you why you didn't make budget...paper work is different on every machine and they will write you up for mistakes on paperwork that nobody show you how to fill out"
bad,"If you like being micro-managed this is your place. When management micromanages is always an indication they do not know what they are doing and in theory, they justify themselves"
bad,I was a POIII in the LVPPM plant for 2 years. the management was horrible. the supervisor knew certain people would never do their job yet did nothing about it. machines kept breaking down and they would slap a band aid on it but never fix it completely which led to many 6 day a week work weeks.
bad,"Since I was started to work in care fusion, I am not happy, job is fine but the people around you is not they're have favoritism they tolerate people making a troubled, poor rating management."
bad,Great co-workers but horrible management. Not willing to stand up for the employees. If you raise a concern it is not taken seriously then you are turned into outcast. Hugely understaffed causing tension with the team and other departments. Management has no knowledge of the day to day functions of those they are supposed to be managing.
bad,"Very mean-spirited people at BD, they gossip about past & current employees, discriminatory comments by management ""leads"" which is embedded deep at this hostile work environment.  Turnover is high."
bad,"Management was not what I expected, completely hands off and did not seem to care about employees. Little to no camaraderie."
bad,Manque de reconnaissance. Charge de travail importante. Culture d'entreprise fluctuante
bad,"This Company Has Very Bad Management, It has good workers and good production."
bad,"Wonderful technology that has a measurable beneficial impact on patient care."
bad,"I was employed at BD Medical for 6 years and hated every minute of it. Their core values are a joke. We (the employees) used to say that yes BD is helping all people live healthy lives unless you are employed by them, then you don't mater. That's what it boiled down to, we didn't mater unless we were at our machines cranking out the product. There is no work/life balance. If you have kids expect not to spend time with them. It was almost impossible to stay home with a sick kid. We were told on a regular basis to schedule appointments on our days off, which we tried to do, but they would schedule mandatory overtime and didn't care if you had prior engagements. It was your job to find the coverage. All in all management is bad and they treat people like slaves. I am glad I left and glad I never have to go back"
bad,Management doesn't take care of the employees.
bad,My advise is STAY CLEAR. Sr Management does not care for their people ( the ones doing the work). NO TRAINING!!! NO SUPPORT by Directors. It is a burn and churn environment!!! Be warned!!!!
bad,"mangement treats you like a number, not very family orinated"
bad,The people I worked with personally were nice for the most part. There were some people that I did not get along with. Management could be scary and the work environment stressful.
bad,"As a Manufacturing Engineer in the Biosciences Division, I had quite a work load but it wasn't unmanageable.  The manager was absolutely horrible, had almost no management training or experience and it was blatantly obvious he didn't have a clue about how to be a good leader. When overwhelmed with high priority activities that required immediate attention and completion to avoid having production lines shut down, he strategically lapsed in being mindful of the potential long term consequences of cutting corners to get things done in time.  BD products are sold in a regulated industry and are directly used on patients and in medical facilities, so quality is necessarily of utmost importance above all else.  This management tended to forget that when the chips were down and all eyes were on him, when a production line was threatening to shut down because of lack of parts, or a down tool, or an out of spec part that requires an update prior to acceptable use.  This manager in particular had no vision for long term quality his only concern was shipping products for revenue. He was also dishonest on several occasions and I caught him in lies which I just let pass without incident, but I had no respect for him after that.  "
bad,"BD has stopped caring about its employees, I'm second generation with the company. My mother worked there 20 years and the company used to be family oriented and care about employees. It is a very good paying job for the area, but your family life suffers if you are on nights."
bad,"My experience in my first year was very pleasant, However, once it became clear that BD was going to take over, the atmosphere became negative and stressful."
bad,"I began working here when we were still C.R. Bard. The culture is very segregated and very much an old white male club. There is generally no direction or inclusiveness. Staff is terribly overworked and has the highest turn-over rate I have seen in my entire career. Additionally, the pay is horrible!! Since BD has taken over, we now have remote days. However, the management here seems to feel that overtime (unpaid overtime) should be a part of our lives as opposed to actually hiring enough employees to handle the work load."
bad,"Organisation déplorable : "
bad,"This is a company in constant management churn - even since BD bought them. There is zero room to advance, every decision is political and product development is simply not a priority, but the *appearance* of product development is critical.  Execs come, punch their card and go onto the next gig so there is no consistent direction.  In the beginning, comprehensive customer support was a huge selling point for the products, but now that BD has outsourced those folks, it's clearly not.   Add to that, the pay is inadequate to survive in San Diego."
bad,"The actual work was not bad. It was the drama that the supervisor like to create and pit the workers against each other. The supervisor had her favorites and those employees never had to work. It was difficult to come everyday and work hard when your co-workers would sit around laughing and talking , not doing anything. I also saw three different employees sleeping and the supervisor looked the other way. I thought I could ignore all that because the pay was decent, but after awhile it got to me. The stress of the job was high because work was not getting done. If you are a person of integrity - run. Company got bought out by Becton Dickinson so don't be fooled by them advertising under that name."
bad,No habia crecimiento y te bajan tu puesto a uno inferior si se les da la gana; vas a horas extras por que vas. No hay dialogo con los de RH.

bad,"Medical billing duties, Responsible for ensuring the accuracy of all pertinent data fields on a claim to ensure timely and maximum reimbursement, review each file for accurate and complete doctor, diagnosis, insurance, and patient demographics. Review each file to ensure the items dispensed match and do not exceed the quantity prescribed. Utilize all tools available to review file history to ensure the order is accurate and complete the appropriate screens in the billing software to ensure the revenue is recognized. Answer inbound and outbound calls follow up if necessary.  Keep a daily report of all mailed and faxed documents on Excel spreadsheet as well as on production sheet, making sure all documents go out before due date."
bad,"Work here starts off as a steady and balanced environment. It ends in loads of drama and rumors spread because manufacturing includes working close to others daily. People seldom keep to themselves, favoritism is a consistent factor to battle against, and corruption is at an all time high especially amongst smaller work groups because the pressure waivers up and down to complete work orders. Very stressful place to work."
bad,Not worth the pay/time. Seniority does not matter. There is no room for advancement. They expect you to give everything and not really expect much in return.
bad,"If you do well, U stay long. Otherwise, Go home, kind of approach."
bad,wouldn't go back to work there just because the pay in not so great and there is no job security. It was all very easy but there is better paying jobs out there
bad,"Learning how to Ship Fed Ex, USPS. UPS as well as pulling the Orders to be ship. The hardest part of the Job was fufilling the Orders in a timely manner but it was a good challenge."
bad,"Favoritism, inept management, and an impossibility for advancement. This place simply sucked. And when they where bought out, the execs got bonuses, most managed to stick around, and the rest of us got the shaft."
bad,"Unless you ""play the game"" you are going no where in this place. I sat in the same position for years and years and I was always given an excuse for not moving ahead. Meanwhile the people who did move ahead did ""play the game"" very well and guess what? They weren't so bright. This company always made me feel like I wasn't good enough when in reality the opposite is true.The culture is plain cold and quite strange. This company is totally full of itself and ALWAYS going on and on about how wonderful they are. Believe me that is not the case. Did I mention all the million levels of management and all the red tape? BD is so top heavy with managers that the whole place is going to tip over one day. The red tape is so plentiful that the whole place is suffocating on it. I understand that practically every company has some degree of politics in it but my gosh I've never seen anything quite like this place. There are more politicians in Franklin Lakes, NJ than in Washington DC. SICKENING. If you are an honest and hard working finance professional, do yourself a favor and stay away from this place. You WILL NOT get ahead and the BS that goes on around WILL WEAR YOU OUT. If you do decide to work in this disaster, KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN."
bad,Contract opportunity. Job details and original job description totally different. Do not recommend to anyone
bad,The production supervisor is terrible she has no clue about anything they make and is never present. I never seen a supervisor take off as much time as she does. And they have been so slow for the last 6 months because they are putting all their eggs in one basket hoping a new line will change everything. No room for advancement they will tell you anything to keep you.
bad,"There is no discipline. If you show up for work & that is all you do, that is fine with management. You get to do other people’s work while they nap. Their main priority is the final product & nothing else. They could care less how they got it. If their are 10 people working on the job, it is ok for just 5 to work. The others can nap & take breaks for most of their work day."
bad,The job was a good learning experience i enjoyed my coworker and all the interesting things I learned about latex and compounds as well But must say they could definitely use better management
bad,"Very dramatic environment. Favoritism is quite evident. I have personally seen at least 5 people leave/transfer within this past year ALONE. Talking, crying and confiding to higher ups does nothing. Changes need to be made or it will be a constant revolving door."
bad,"I hated this place. The people there are stuck in their own ways. Only two days of sick days and you have to take them consecutively or it wont count. They don't care about your personal life. If you are one minute late, they will point you. Doesn't  matter what the situation is. It was so stressful working there. Felt like a slave plantation. I will never go back there and I would never recommend anyone I know to work there."
bad,"That place is nothing but drama. The management suck and ever since the new company bought it, the whole place has gone downhill.  Very bad atmosphere if you ask me."
bad,If your young with no kids or an adult whose kids have left home then this job is perfect. Does not fit with day care hours and the mandatory overtime is nonstop! But if you have no children and are looking to work your life away for the over time hours then this is the place...
bad,Probably one of the most exciting and promising roles to date-   disappointing that a company who promotes equality so publicly does nothing to stamp out the boys club mentality in a male domimated role. Fit their culture or hit the road. Weigh up if the promise of a bright future will fit the sexist nature of the company.
bad,Bard and BD have different approaches to systems although culture is somewhat similar. Legacy Bard sites have different cultures depending on where located and respective management.
bad,"Work life balance is good if you make it happen. For a big company, the benefits are ok compared to the industry but by far behind the best companies to work for. Parking is plenty. The buildings are in ok condition with working and cleaning toilets most of the time. The newly renovated cafeteria and lobby are stunning. But, the cost of dining there has doubled."
bad,Upper management would rather hire their friends than worker's that can actually get the job done in a timely manner. This results in incompetent workers getting promoted.
bad,"Starting out I loved my job! Hours were regular and I could go to school, work, and also have a life outside of those things. I learned to work in an extremely fast paced environment and communicate effectively between many parties. I quit because management was inconsistent, inflexible, and flat out rude. We were required to work ridiculous hours and I never got a day off of work. We worked for a total of over 70 days straight! The only way I would ever come back is if there was a complete management overhaul and the production caught up."
bad,The changes made have been bad. They put people in management positions that don't know what they are doing and tend to pick favorites. Also the changes made anyone new who is hired on even as temps get only half the training they need to work there and fully understand the job requirements.
bad,Une entreprise très hiérarchisée avec un gros manque de communication entre les equips.
bad,"Lutonix in new hope was truly the worst place I have ever worked. They treat contractors like dogs, order food and don't invite contractors but they can have the leftovers. They are not invited to any meetings. Very unorganized. Employees sit with nothing to do until production lead decides to show up. Always rebuilding product from lack of good training and organizing. It's a revolving door not only for contractors but permanent employees as well. After they lay you off with zero notice they have the nerve to ask if you want to come back. Like you just sit around and wait for them. They have people who sit around all day  I and do nothing.Not sure how they manage to keep operating there with all the disarray."
bad,I was hired for a temp to permanent position at this company. I really have nothing to say about the place because its really just the average tech company for medical equipment.
bad,"Good people working at all levels but top management is 3,000 miles away so sometimes people aren't all going in the same direction. They outsourced almost all IT functions, but the business team is strong."
bad,"pros:  paid medical insurance, casual dress"
bad,"Racist, No room for advancement unless you in their buddy system. Cut - throat workers that's buddies with management. Workers are scared to speak out fearing they will get fired."
bad,"slave work,  rotational shifts 12am on 12pm off for two weeks. the switch to 12pm to 12 am shifts.  Never get settled always tired no family life"
bad,"Once Carefusion took over company the middle management became intolerable, everything was all finger pointing and who's to blame for any issue that came up. The structure of Carefusion placed Human resource duties with the middle management and it was soon discovered that the employees no longer had a voice."
bad,The job itself is very easy.. Would be better if every single task wasn't so overly micro managed. Co-workers are awful.. Everyone seems to like each other until you get to hear them talk about how much they hate everyone.Sabotaging new hires is apparently common place. If you're  lucky someone who's been there a while will reminisce about having to go to hr about it when they started. Everyone is a temp so they're competing with you for a contract renewal. You have very little chance of becoming a permanent employee.. And that's gotten even less likely since the company was taken over by bd.
bad,"I worked at Carefusion which was recently bought out by BD.  Overall, it was an ok experience but do not recommend working there in general or if you plan to stay longer term.  The company is primarily focused on short term cost savings.  No emphasis on new product development.  The company is not well structured at all and do not manage schedules in any way.  There are no milestones, ramp up dates, ....  Directors are not exactly progressive."
bad,You are on call 24/7 at this location because you are the only Carefusion tech for 200 miles.  Since you have a 4 hour maximum response time on the largest customer you basically can never drink alcohol because you can be dispatched and need to drive at any minute.  You also cannot plan anything unless you take a vacation day and someone is assigned to cover your area.  Every site you go to has to provide an escort because you are dealing with controlled medications and of course none of the businesses want to give up an employee just to sit and watch you so nobody is every glad to see you and they only call you once the equipment is really broken.  So you might work a twelve hour day at one site and then an hour later when you just fall asleep get a call to drive 50 miles and work another 12 hours.  The only thing I enjoyed about the job was the friend I made of another technician during training and the training was in California.  Then some days you will not get a call at all but of course all you can do is online training or sit and wait because you never know when the call will come. My managers only concerns seemed to be statistics and having constant unnecessary meetings.
bad,Company hires a lot of temp workers that don't know what there doing.
bad,Management is not interested in finding solutions to problems. Only the bottom line. Lots of favoritism in upper management. Lots of drama. Highly stressful enviroment
bad,"Carefusion has plenty of work to go around. If you want a secure place to be, the company is growing and is learning how to deal with that."
bad,High Stress enviroment. Eng Techs are asked to work at a level under their job title and a level above.
bad,Buen equipo de trabajo buen ambiente nomas el supervisof
bad,Management was horrible at decision making and never listen to employees's opinions. Little room to no room for advancement. Compensation was not up to date.
bad,"i worked there for a short period of time. first they stuck me in a section and expected me to be trained in 1 day, then put me by myself. they only offer certain people over time, even if you put in the work and ask for it. the supervisor is never to be found and when she is around shes really no help. ive asked to move positions even talked to the supervisor in a different section and he agreed but the supervisor in my section would not allow for me to switch. seemed like unfair treatment"
bad,The positions are mostly hourly so the work like is left at work. There is a lot of turn over. I was a contract employee there for 2 months. A lot of family members of the founder work there.
bad,Not a bad place to work. they let me charge my electric car. They have free coffee. Workout gym on site. Close to the I 5 and I 805. Nice place to eat on site.
bad,Once CFN was bought out by BD the transition became messy and unorganized.  It was not an environment I would return to or refer anyone to work there.
bad,"BD is a great place to work.  Unfortunately the Diabetes Care Business was being run by a President and VP of Operations that were not concerned at all about the employees.  They were only looking out for themselves.  Forced performance ratings on reviews were just the tip of the iceberg.  Accomplishments were not recognized and it was always about, you could have done that better, rather than good job."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend my friends or anonymous to work here. The focus of a working environment is to get the job done, but here, the goal is different. I'm not sure about others, but when I worked there, I felt like I was back in school. It's NOT a bad company, but bad management."
bad,"Accenture is a great place to work if you're in the right project and have the right manager. If not, it will be bad. I was there before the changes made to performance review. So not sure if the change made it better. But before, everything depends on your manager."
bad,Work as a temp for hire the pay was great. But if you are going there as a temp do work in the rubber department. It is one of the worst departments in the plant. The manager and supervisors will not give you a honest answer but we hire people who come in after you. Then tell you they are looking for a place to put you. They treat their temps as if they are not people but numbers that they need to keep a track on.
bad,"The job was hard, the hours sucked (We were often stuck with ""Mandatory Overtime"" which sometimes meant working 7 days a week) and the management was incompetent. Getting vacation time is practically impossible as it's YOUR responsibility to find people to cover for you. The only upside is that the company pays extremely well."
bad,"chaotic, more of a manufacturing mentality, not so great for agile software development"
bad,If you are looking to sell our soul this is the company for you
bad,"A Empresa paga seus salários no dia combinado e tem um excelente plano de saúde; porém , não oferece oportunidades de crescimento na carreira e parece não fazer muita questão disso."
bad,"The company got bought by SAIC and I made a good bit of money. Other than that, I'd prefer to not discuess my old employer."
bad,"Within the Supply Chain the jobs are less stressful and more independent which is a huge pro."
bad,There were multiple changes with management that happened frequently.  There were lots of job descriptions that changed on a regular basis.  Multiple work exercises that required using your free time after work to complete.
bad,The people are good to work with. The organization is quite political and advancement is dependant on who you know and who likes you more than the quality of your work.
bad,BD does not provide much support for Managers and Supervisors.  These positions are set up to fail because most departments are understaffed. Upper management does not seem to care because they continue to allow this to happen.
bad,Don't get on Management's bad side they will find a reason to fire you .pay was excellent alot of overtime co-workers were great new people all the time training is inadequate and demand is high for skills in molding.mangement doesn't mind letting underskilled employees doing technical work with no compensation.molding presses leaking oil . Management decided to fix floor instead of machines.
bad,"Great team "
bad,"Currently they are expanding production, but reducing the head count  at BD East. There has been a high turnover rate since the movement of Glass out of Columbus was announced."
bad,"Before the BD takeover, the company appeared to be on the right track. Following the influx of BD management however, things went downhill quickly with a sharp focus on Outsourcing, in spite of violations to the regulated standards. At this point, I would recommend avoiding."
bad,"Poor communication from France back to the states with little or no direction on product launch effectiveness.  "
bad,"Great company but the culture supports lengthy tenures with unskilled staff, who say always, ""this is the way is has been done in the past"""
bad,"My experience their was alright I guess, I work you like a slave and a raise??? for forget it! There's loyal employee's who's been there for over 5 years and still making 10 dollars a hr!"
bad,"Not many options for career advancement"
bad,Little chance of advancement. Upper management has little care for customer support.  They expect more with little resources and can expect layoffs every 2 to 3 years.
bad,Quality Engineer - intern:
bad,"The work is not hard, some people didn't take it seriously about what must be done. I got chastised for doing it right. The people treated me like an outsider and not very friendly"
bad,I was fooled into believing this is a company of integrity and inclusion but then I witnessed disrespectable people remain and thrive. I suppose inclusion means keeping subpar employees. I know there are MANY people equally intelligent and capable as the ones at BD that behave inappropriately.
bad,It was a great learning experience working for this company. Unfortunately the department that I was working in had gotten laid off and was taken over by BD in Texas.
bad,"For as hard as you work to try and verify and process insurance information, it never ends. Crunch time came from the last 3 months of the year through the first 4, due to insurance changes and the like. During crunch time- you work 50-60 hours a week and the process never ends.  It wasn't difficult, but it was not worth the low pay, and the lack of training. Management was very good, but did not have the time or personal presence to allow a full and thorough training of all of the necessary procedures involved with the myriad of providers and products utilized in this potion."
bad,the mangers there treated you fairly but to the company leaders you are just a number that can be replaced.  If they can make money doing something or relocating they will. They would lie to your face and expect you to be honest and dedicated to their success.  It really showed you how company leaders think of the people who make them their money.
bad,"For Miami Site only:"
bad,"I really enjoy the job and the work that i do but unfortunately the positives seem to stop there. You manage work from home which means you never get away from it. Your on call almost all the time and a lot of weekends so your phone is always ringing and you could have to leave at any hour day or night. I wouldnt mind that so much except you are not compensated for being on call, so anywhere you go, anything you do, you must make sure you take your company vehicle, your phone, and work clothes everywhere. And if you have a family that means taking two cars everywhere you go as you may have to leave at any given minute, which again wouldnt be so bad except you dont get compensated for this. You are also responsible for managing all the paper work and business sides of things such as expense reports, timecards, emails, online training courses, closing calls, and scheduling or talking to customers. So when you are not out running calls and you have free time, this is the stuff that needs done, and since you get paid when running calls that means you are doing all the extra stuff on your off time without compensation. The job is exciting, i love managing my own work day and having a new day everyday, but the job will leave you feeling like you are never not working and wondering why you are not being compensated for 50% of the work you perform."
bad,This company spun from Cardinal and once it did there was a huge shift in integrity and stability.  Sr. Mgt lied about research and products.
bad,Fast paced work environment.  People are willing to go the extra mile to get the job done.  Hard working individuals.  Management encourages the use of Kaizens to tackle problems that arise or those that are long standing.
bad,"One of the worst cases of ""Old Boy's Network"" I've seen anywhere."
bad,This company has been in this location for almost 50years. With a continuation of growth in all departments is success for job security. this compensation for a majority of positions is really good. Time off from your job is unsatisfactory.
bad,I was at BD as a contractor and did not get a great impression of the company. The job I thought I had come to do was completely different than the one I ended up doing. There was no support or direction to assist me.
bad,The work environment was comfortable for the most part but it was hard on the body in some ways. The rotating of jobs in the department made things better than sitting in one job all day. The worst part of the job was the constant bending over machinery to do the job.
bad,"Ever challenging scenarios due to product evolving"
bad,"Como supervisor de produccion , las actividades eran meramente administrativas y muy rutinarias, lo que aprendi fue el manejo de la BPD, la administracion fue del tipo de relaciones personales sin tomar en cuenta la experiencia y trayectoria profesional."

bad,This is not a software company - it's a hardware company that thinks it can apply the same process to software development. Top-heavy design and specification over a Agile approach leads to a very difficult development environment.

bad,"After so many acquisitions, company feels like it's losing its direction. R&D is directionless, with priorities changing by the day. Lots of long hours and pointless effort. RIFs every September. I stayed here because I had great coworkers and the products do save lives."
bad,very disappointed with the employees and management. Very rude people. I tried complaining and nothing was ever done. It wasn't a healthy atmosphere
bad,"-llegar saludar a todos mis amigos o compañeros de trabajo y ayudar en lo que se pueda."
bad,"I started every day logging into the computer software and being on the telephone with doctor offices. I learned how to work Goldmine and Reorder. I also learned more about Mastectomy, Colostomy, and Diabetic supplies people need. The management was great at first, then one left and we got a new manager. He was belittling and very unprofessional. My co workers were very to themselves. We had several people quit is because of this new manager. The hardest part of the job was getting the doctor's offices to fill out correctly the Physician's Orders.Especially if the patient's insurance went by Medicare guidelines.The most enjoyable part was helping the patients get their supplies. I enjoyed my job."
bad,This job required the employee to stay in one postition doing the same repetitive movement all day long.  My co-workers were great to work with.  The hardest thing about this job was the lack of being able to move around.  I did enjoy the fast pace of the job.
bad,Covered 3 state area.  Sold urology medical devices in Operating Room and Physician practices.  Trained new sales reps as a Field Sales Trainer. Introduced and sold new intensive care monitors into Mayo Clinic.
bad,Most enjoyable was speaking to clients on the phone who really needed your help.
bad,"Lack of communication between functions and business units, fear for job security and management's lack of interest in employee advancement makes CareFusion a poor company for high potential employees. Read: if you are an ambitious, intelligent risk taker looking for a challenge, CFN may not be the place for you."
bad,Bard overworks their employee's and has no regard for them. Most managers were good but they were unable to make effective changes. Towards the end their were so many changes happening in the company that many were lost.
bad,"La empresa anteriormente daba cursos de capacitación, se preocupaba por las personas, que se sientan a gusto pero hace unos años ha cambiado y ese sentimiento de pertenecer se ha perdido por la gran rotación que tuvo en el ultimo tiempo. Hay buena camaraderia pero entre los asociados de muchos años."
bad,"BD sells syringes which are dangerous and lead to needlestick injuries, creating a huge danger for people in the medical profession who deal with patients and sharps. The insulin syringes they sell are infinitely reusable and are the sole reason why HEP-C spreads in the US. Also, their products kill approximately 1,000,000 people globally on a yearly basis and they do nothing to improve the safety of the products they sell in the 3rd world."
good,"This was not a fun place to work, 12 hour shift overnight plus I had a long commute in the plant is dirty for what they are manufacturing.  Management had favorites."
good,the work is simple. Parts are always moving but the work is SIMPLE. it was not enough to keep me motivated. LTA (J.K) knew less than I did so he was no help when it was time to learn something new.
good,"R&D management needs to organize, provide clear direction and get rid of the toxic environment. I really can not say much more than this, just look at what you are getting into."
good,The harder you work the more likely someone will take credit or set you up. It's those people who get promoted. External hires for all promotable positions instead of internal candidates is the way they like it. Unskilled external folks who need to be trained by tenured employees who are organizationally under them.
good,"The department I worked in had a good group of team players, everyone pitched and helped with all new projects, on a typical day we could received a new task where the deadline was that day  on top of our general duties and every one would help until it was completed."
good,Empresa de dificil relacionamento entre funcionário e Gerencia

good,"Tips would be great place to start your career but not a good company to work for as in pay just a good company to help you get into a bigger and better company. The other downfall about this company is there's not much diversity and a whole lot of favoritism when it comes to hiring since its not much diversity there's a bunch of groups. Other downfall is 1st shift starts at 5am which doesn't give people that much time to sleep I would see people coming to work dosing off tired , sleeping on breaks and in the line when they v"
good,"Spent the day putting out fires, little forward vision implemented. Management seems to only care about superiors views and wants. Unrealistic timelines on projects."
good,"The pay and compensation at BD is great, however, the hours and work life balance often leaves employees leading lives with very little and poor sleep, spending most of their time in a spirit crushing autonomous work environment. And spending every hour away from work sleeping or exhausted."
good,"Lack of good  managers,   People with Hospital degrees in charge of the machine shop. Poor management skills and lack of work required to produce finished product."
good,"It is a great place to learn SO much. It would be a better place if the company understood that happy employees translates into a great company, great products, and a steller reputation."
good,Working in incoming it was difficult to plan a family life cause there was no order of when the shipments would come in. The building is too small for the material we get.
good,"Being from a small, start-up background, it was hard to adjust to how long it takes to get anything done. Often it feels like your work goes into a black hole. There are so many obstacles to doing your work. "
good,"If your desperately in need of a job. Not a happy place to work. People are nice. Managers are cut throat."
good,"High turnover"
good,"No raises have been given in the 5+ years I have worked there; holidays have been taken away; no 401K or any kind of security; the employee moral is very low; employees are must work 40+ hours per week with mandatory overtime during the week as well as on Saturdays and some Sundays.  They cannot keep employees for various reasons and therefore, the employees that stay with the company are penalized and must work crazy overtime to make up for not having full staffs."
good,I used to be a picker at Bard. The money & insurance is good but everything else sux. The people work against each other trying to make the production you are pressured to make. The over time is off the chain. That's ok if you like that but I have a life. A typical day at work is spent fighting each other for work to get your numbers. What I learned was how to look out for myself because no one else will. Management would rather stick their head in the sand like an ostrich rather than hear all the problems that need to be addressed. All I have to say is good luck to all the good people left over there that still have to  deal with it.
good,"on a typical day at Liberator medical supply. I would check my email for service tickets. Prioritize which ones should be taken care of first. Trouble shoot the issue, document all time & work preformed. Educate end users on new programs. install updates replace faulty equipment. I learned a lot working here would love to continue my growth in this field provided with the right opportunity."
good,"Accounting Department was well staffed, nice facility, never wanted for supplies or the right tools to do the job."
good,"Empresa tem ótimo ambiente de trabalho, mas não valoriza seu pessoal , não qualifica sua mão de obra e salario muito baixo."
good,Churn with senior leadership often disengaged with mid-level managers and the details of operations. Annual reorganization first quarter of every fiscal creates stress and fear with employees and individual's contributions often not valued. Compensation imbalance and promotional and compensation decisions often targeted towards short-term organizational/leadership favorites as opposed to long-term contributors and accomplishments. Senior Leadership decisions are short-sighted to temporarily improve bottom-line and long-term employees are not valued.
good,This job is a high stressful job it's good at the start and very hard to move up in the company I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone who gets stressed out easily
good,"The company wants to be lean but the FDA is not about lean. Thats a struggle. Then BD sometimes struggles with put people in leadership positions who can succeed. They need to realized that just because someone has some outstanding degree, does not make him leadership material."
good,Maquiladora con buen control de higiene y salud debido al giro de esta; donde empece a conocer el proceso de extrusión por moldeo.
good,They pay is descent nice place to work at. Management is nice. You be able to live off that job. Great environment work around nice people who are willing to help you.
good,Here you were trained on one thing. When people would flex time it would hold up everyone else.
good,"I have learned a lot of things during tenure with Pyxis and CareFusion.  Employees were once valued and there was a sense of company loyalty but that died when BD took over. Frequent lay-offs, employees no longer feel valued and all new talent are brought in as contractors to avoid costs of paying for benefits. Workplace culture among employees has always been rather pleasant and friendly.  Hardest part of the job is prioritizing multiple tasks all with equal importance when you are the most senior engineer with the skills to handle them. Trying to do your job while being micromanaged is difficult and counterproductive. The most enjoyable part comes in various ways, getting paid is an expected benefit, working among friends, evens outside of work ""team building"" really creates solid moral among peers on the team."
good,"BECTON  a été une bonne expérience sur le plan professionnelle et humaine ."
good,"Great products but lacks the success needed within the supply chain to deliver.  Mgmt is in constant flux and always revolving."
good,"They have laid so many people off. I never felt secure after they purchased CareFusion. They have outsourced so much of their processes, that it is hard to find a job. There is a job freeze through 12/31/2017."
good,"management is very bad, job is easy but really hard to work with upper management. it like a mini version of Johnson and Johnson since most of employees are former J&J workers."
good,"Cons:  Working at Bard Medical, based out of Covington, GA, should be viewed as a place for limited advancement and career development.  This is driven by poor senior management team, office politics, and internal conflicts of interest as each department is driven by its own set of rules that does not serve the best interest of the organization.    "
good,Busy 24/7/365. Talent and accomplishment don't count. To keep your job or to be remotely considered for advancement you must network your way up.
good,A typical day at work here for me is never repeated twice.  I have diverse responsibilities and work with a large team of individuals. I am fortunate that I enjoy working with and also learn things from often.  I have expanded on my Corporate business knowledge and have accomplished getting familiar and working well with all of Senior Management and the Executive Assistants that support them.  The hardest part of my job can be assembling all of Senior Management in a very short period of time for a meeting.  Management is located internationally and it's a challenge but I do get it done.
good,"Customer service, sales of diabetic testing supplies. Management was ok. It was a fairly new business at the time. The hardest part of the jobwas meeting thes sales quotas. Most enjoyable part was that I worked with my best friend."
good,Working in the corporate QA department is a dynamic environment. It is very project and process improvement driven. Would like to advance to more challenging projects that best matches my skill-set and working potential.
good,Everybody is not allowed to move up. They will hire people off the street instead of giving certain people opportunities. Management is terrible and only look out for people that worked for them at previous jobs.
good,"typical day at work boring nothing much to learn same old same old for the past 3 years, after 3 years there only 2 product on the line. product is not stable lots of issues."
good,Lots of stress because of the people. Work is easy. Environment is cut throat for no reason. Management favors a select few. Work ethic is not an important factor to supervisors.
good,"No hay retos, dificil oportunidad de crecimiento.."
good,Buying too many companies and destroying them. Laying off a lot of people close to retirement. If you are not in their Franklin Lakes facility no job is secure.
good,Habian personas que se portaban groseramente se creian superior a otros
good,"BD constantly provided the opportunity to learn and grow.  However, there were limited opportunities, outside of headquarters, to advance to management position."
good,"i enjoyed my time there, but managerment was very unappreciative, Some of the manament was great, but many of the employee were not cut out for the job, it was like high school."
good,"Management shows favoritism. Management doesn’t offer proper compensation in correlation to job title. Expression of opinion is deemed “disrespectful.” Fairness across the board is case by case basis. Poor management can turn a good, hard worker into a poor employee."
good,"Overall i enjoyed my time at BARD. the downside was the individual I worked for in the specific department. "
good,"Very demanding environment, with no consideration for the employee personal life. It is just not an employee friendly atmosphere. Limited access to having a family relationship."
good,"BD is an interesting place to work. They make great products, and a lot of them, but it is very cut throat environment with no loyalty to any employee."
good,"Would not work under contract for this company, They do not treat contract workers right and PAS system group at HQ franklin lakes is not what it makes it seem to be."
good,"- No job security for shared services, unless you are in the core business. "
good,"Good pay, constant layoffs, changing priorities, nice people, outdated products. Don't challenge the status quo, keep your head down and keep working, soon enough you will be asked to stop working on what you are doing and work on something else."
good,Only the but kissers and friends of upper management get promoted. The company was better before the original management team quit and they brought in all new management.
good,"Even though I have enthusiasm for this position, it doesn't matter if I am on time and there- the ""goal"" of working 25 files a day, if you don't get there and maintain, you will probably not have a job like I might not in next few weeks."
good,"Great training program, learned about mastectomy products, Ostomy products and Urology products.Co workers were friendly."
good,Routine work on software application development and test. Team work required on all aspects and organized through different levels. Nice treat to most of  employees but not to contracted workers. Project coordination needs to have more improvement.
good,"Great coworkers - all very dedicated,"
good,"Worked in a hospital environment"
good,"Keep machines running a improve the process, keep mouth shut and don't suggest anything and just do your job. No trust in Management or support. Trying to keep positive without any support from management. Three o'clock. Was a good place to work, went down hill in the last 3 years........"
good,"A good place with helpful and friendly people to work with. While they keep good and hardworking employees, the temps are a different story. I worked here for 3 years and never got hired on full time."
good,"BD tries. There are potlucks and even a whole week where they set up games and prizes. Management is hit or miss. Mine CAN be a micromanager but they don't micromanage me so I don't feel like I can speak on that. Workload varies with call volumes which are influenced by several factors such as natural disasters, federal billing cycles, holidays and community time off. You are paid extra to work holidays.  "
good,"Ambiente tranquilo, mas sem chance de crescimento, tem vários benefícios"
good,Management sucks. People just don't care anymore. The product that is being made people should care more but they don't they need qa on all shifts not just first and management needs to spend more time on the off shifts
good,"pay not that good. more hour and no life or time for family. It was a good place to work at first . good culture. very poor management teams ."
good,"horaires en 3x8"
good,Your direct supervisors are the best people to learn from. The flexibility given is great for anyone with crazy schedules or kids. Our benefits are touted as some of the best but I think they are about average. Pay is below average. Upward mobility is limited but horizontal mobility is encouraged. Great place to learn as much as you can about a certain position and move on to the next one that interests you.
good,"The job is very repetitive and soon you may become bored of the orders assigned due to lack of variety. The job is very low stress which is very nice, but at the same time the environment is very fast paced to complete on average 6-8 orders a day. The people working make the job easier and manageable. You do get 2 paid breaks and a 30 minute lunch."
good,"Management has been very slow to develop and share a cohesive roadmap for moving forward. Employees lack direction, have a poor work-life balance and are not provided opportunities to advance. "
good,Un gran equipo y una organización a nivel de la unidad fuerte con el seguimiento de todos los aspectos que afectan al producto
good,"BD is a medical technology company that serves healthcare institutions, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, industry and the general public. BD manufactures and sells a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products. BD is headquartered in the United States and has offices in more than 50 countries worldwide."
good,"Working this job was very monotonous as it required one to sit at an assembling table doing the same task for hours. Additionally, there was little room of error because we were assembling medical equipment."
good,Becton Dickinson is a good place to work but could be better. They provide good benifits. Becton Dickinson departments are usually 12 hour shifts. Overtime may be mandatory at times.
good,it was a good job while it lasted but the company was bought out and is no longer accepting new workers.  They had government orders which were the largest orders we ever had.
good,Aprendizaje en negociacion y manejo del mundo hospitalario.
good,"I work from 6 pm to 6 am (night shift), most of the 6 years here I have worked by myself and called someone at home if I needed assistance. I came from a world of dc electronics into a world of analog technology, even though i asked for more training none was offered to me, but i muddled through. Hardest part of job trying to decipher numerous programing styles of previous electronic techs that each had their on style and ideas of how to program the PLC processors. Also the antiquated equipment that the company refused to updated and i was unable to get into program because it is so out of date."
good,"Small site overall BD is a huge company the site in which I work is not flexible to change for improvement.  Most process and procedures are outdated and lack the new insight to stay striving with technology, knowledge and drive."
good,BD INDIA PVT LTD.is good company also but work load is too high and work full of with stress that's why long time working here is not possible to me. But good for those who are local area Person.
good,I like working at BD but worked for a Vice President who was terrible.  He didn't have a clue about process development or how to run a manufacturing plant.
good,As a team leader the job could be very difficult because of the language barrier in the facility. There was nobody in management that spoke all of the languages that where in the building.
good,"Within in my job title I have taken it upon myself to learn Lean and Kaizan, which I think plays a very big role in any manufacturing company."
good,"poor management, benefits package not the best, high turnover, not alot of opportunities for advancement, friendly co-workers. balanced job work/life."
good,"Pour la quantité de travail que les employés doivent effectuer, le salaire n'est pas à la norme pour des postes similaires ailleurs."
good,"Promotion is extremely hard to come by and has to be fought for. Management are not particularly interested in the progression of their employees, rather fighting for their own development."
good,Company only pays 10.00 an hour with no raises ever. Very demanding work place and at times can cause severe stress. When mistakes are made they tend to not take into account possible human error and are quick to terminate employees. At times the language used and action of some employees and members of management are inappropriate.
good,"the job was easy,its just they do a lot of micromanaging and its a lot of stress on u to perform your job duties etc.job was fun ,great company."
good,"Productive work environment"
good,Job was ok until work started to run low. The employees act like their your boss. Some older ladies dont really like young girls so much. Everyone stays in each others business especially about your personal life! Keep everything to yourself. If you dont fit in youll hate it there.
good,"Decent medical benefits and paid time off.  Hard to advance and although they state during orientation that raises are given based on merit, there are MANY long term employees that have been there over 5 years and still make the same they did when they were hired."
good,In the last year the management does not have the skills necessary to manage so the culture has taken a serious hit. The benefits package and the coworkers are exceptional. There is very little room for advancement though and many people tend to move out of the company rather than up.
good,General inventory duties very open place to work. It is not as corporate as other companies.
good,"I came to CareFusion as their first records person since spinning from Cardinal Health.  Was able to get years of records properly filed, put in place a current records retention policy, began to store all contracts electronically.  "
good,"Great place to work independently, and with other employees. You start at 14.00 dollars an hour and you basically control your raises by skiiling up on the machine that you operate, by going from a basic operator to skill 1 and so on, so with in a year you can be at 19.00 dollars an hour depending how fast you have technician train you. The job itself was great, except that you would only get basically a half a day off, and for those with family and kids like myself it made it hard to be with your family when you work second or third shift."
good,In my role I managed internal/employee communications and external communications. This overall responsibility was very rewarding.
good,"Typical day included traveling to account sites, either Hospital or Nursing home and installing equipment and/or training staff. When no installations happening, on-line training or helping a colleague."
good,*bom
good,Demanding job with good compensation but poor work life balance.  You have an 8hr day schedule but on call an hour before shift and 3hrs after shift.  Makes for a 12hr day 5 days a week.
good,The experience working for BD will vary widely by department and manager.  The traditionally strong company culture seems to have gotten lost in the face of recent acquisitions.  Overall it is still a good organization and with the right manager will offer strong growth potential and opportunities for success.
good,"reasonable mnc with generally good colleagues but IT/tech culture integration is pretty weak."
good,"If you are hitting the numbers, everything is golden, but if you aren't expect to spend a lot of your time talking about why. If you hit your numbers for a few years, they expect improvements until improvements cannot be made."
good,Las rutinas son normales. La parte más difil actual del trabajo es el rol actual de 12 hrs
good,"Aggrestive , target aimed company. "
good,At work station all day or all night long. Punching holes in catheters. Have to do at least 800 catheters a shift. The mangers are very nice and care.
good,"Two major acquisitions have resulted in a state of constant reorganization and changing priorities.  Too many priorities and not enough time, resources, and money."
good,"Started at BD to get out of a low-paying job, in order to pay student loans. Besides poor management, operators are expected to run lines that are not meant for one person, which is DANGEROUS."
good,"Great place to work with some really great benefits like flex hours, onsite gyms including classes, great cafeteria, sustainable practices, beautiful campus in FLKS, but people work long hours and management isn't held accountable.  Internal change is slow and getting things done quickly is cumbersome."
good,"When I began with BD, I loved it! I believed in our message and our products and I was proud of what I did in my accounts, for my clinicians and my patients. In the last 6 years, things have changed and in the last 6 months, things have changed drastically for me in my roll. I was once respected and trusted for my knowledge and my skill and I felt a valued member of the team. Lately, my skill and expertise is not as valued and the expectations in my roll greatly diminished. Now, I don't know what a typical day at work is going to look like or what the culture will be like. If I stay, ask me again in 6 months."
good,"I read a lot of reviews about this company before posting mine and most others had the same experience I did. Poor management, indecision, cliquey culture and stressful work environment at times. I found BD to have the worst HR I have worked with, at least in NC. If you have issues don't even bother bringing them to the management attention because you will be labeled a complainer, unless you are a ""minority"". In my time with BD, the company received very low ratings on employee engagement survey's almost yearly yet nothing was ever done about it. Performance reviews are a joke. HR and Sr. leadership establish these at the beginning of the year so no matter how hard you work, volunteer or are a ""team player"" it won't matter. Policies and Procedures mean nothing in this company, most are worked around to benefit the process or employee. Personally, I think this company, at least the NC WH&C sites need to ""cut the head off management"" and start over."
good,Not a good place to work.  Poor management and stressful atmosphere.  Managers are self centered and only interested in their own advancement.  Morale is very poor in all areas of this company.
good,"Directors, managers and supervisors have poor management skills. Oblivious to what is going on. The company is to big with lots of chiefs and not enough  indians."
good,"Not a lot of communication between departments. No control of your assigned projects,other departments just get in the way of you completing your tasks/projects in a timely manner, which will effect your review."
good,"Job paid very well and there was no shortage of hours available.  That being said, there was also a lot of non optional overtime.  The work culture is very competitive, often in a non productive way.  Management is overly invasive, making rules about nearly every operation you perform though often enforcing them poorly.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with short breaks that seem to be below industry standard, while keeping job performance high.  The most enjoyable part of the job honestly was the financial security that it brought.  It might take up a lot of your time and bring a lot of stress, but time off is a lot more relaxing when you aren't struggling financially."
good,"As with many companies in the medical device industry, this job requires huge amounts of paperwork.  The work itself is fascinating and rewarding but can occasionally become bogged down in a bloated quality system."
good,I had a contract position that required too much travelling. The only reason I took the position was because I was in need of work. The company was good to work for. I only left because I needed more time at home.
good,Bard lacks the technology that most of its competitors use. It's like they are stuck in the 90's. They don't offer competitive salaries. Most of the employees are either Temps or Interns.
good,Nice friendly co workers the lack of Management and understanding of what it takes to keep valuable employees.  Overall the place is nice and the people there are upbeat and positive.
good,"with the changing technology in the micro space BD is behind the technology curve.  "
good,"BD used to be a great company to work for but recently the politics is overtaking everything. Lots of backstabbing managers are around and the new re-org is leaving a lot of people with a bad taste in their mouth."
good,Fast pace busy environment with no advancement up the ladder. Carefusion is a company that hires from the outside and does not hire up from inside of the company.
good,It was a good work place. Good people to work for they were fair with their employees. They put me thru school for the Mastectomy Department. I moved to another county.
good,good company but they don't recognize loyal employees and they bring in contractors so they can pay them less than current employees. They lay off people who make high salary to replace them with lower paid individuals.
good,Fast paced some days others it's really slow it just depends on how the machines are running on any given day also has great pay for the work all in all good place
good,"Trabalho executado todos os dias com muito planejamento e organização; o planejamento é a base para o sucesso, com uma equipe bem preparada e empenhados em atingir os objetivos.As vezes não é possível chegar ao resultado esperado, mas na maioria das vezes superamos as expectativas"
good,"I have been with this company for 3 years now, and when I was fresh out of high school in 2007 I worked here until 2010. It's a good starter job for freshly out of high school kids who want a career."
good,"Contracted for BD for 7 months.  Very nice campus to work in and great colleagues.   However, there is very poor leadership and everyone seems to leave after 3-5 years which results in lack of continuity and confusion.  They change contractors often.  Very strange and secretive environment.  They do not work smart and often the work is redundant because there are so many silos and turnovers.  There does seem to be a disconnect between corporate and manufacturing sides of the firm."
good,bard was a great place to work good people and at most a good company. once they got the right people in charge it really became a well respected work place
good,"Assembling and troubleshooting medical instruments."
good,"I have work for BD through Opusing contract."
good,"Doing pm's on machine, getting SAP certifited, conducting inventory, and multitasking. Work with a lot of helpful people and pleasant co- workers. My only problem was supervisor's constantly changing no structure."
good,"Never saw such diversity and so many healthy choices in the food! I wish they let consultants use the gym, given the great food."
good,"Get the experience and get out,"
good,"Its Radio Shack.  What can I say.  Its either very slow or really busy.  very professional environment, a lot of turn around due to most positions being part time but other wise I enjoyed my time here at Radio Shack"
good,"Good place to work, very demanding work schedule,tough though it does bring out the best in the associates."
good,"pick and pack catheter orders for patients,  pull orders from main computer,  scan and ship packages to patients"
good,"I worked at Pyxis / Cardinal Health / CareFusion for twelve years.  I have fond memories of my early years at Pyxis and its energetic and innovative start up atmosphere.  After Cardinal acquired Alaris and spun Pyxis, Alaris, Viasys and other medical device acquisitions off to form CareFusion, the atmosphere changed dramatically.  The best things about CareFusion are it's products, customers, and mission (to make healthcare safer).  The worst thing about CareFusion is the constant lay offs and turnover of manager, director and VPs.  Change in the workplace is good, but CareFusion is dangling like a pendulum and it's hard to tell if the changes are going anywhere.  The constant change of leadership and insecurity of the workforce makes a very unpleasant and unproductive work environment.  If the company can stabilize its management and workforce, it could become a great place to work again.    "
good,"typisk arbetsdag:haft jobba både som maskinoperatör och slutkvalitetskontrollant.Jag hade bra på jobbet,trivs med jobbet och med mina arbetskollegor ,oavsett att vi jobbat hade vi rolig och mycket skoj .Tycker inte att jag hade svårt på jobbet,tvärtom, kanske på grund av att jag tycker att jobba .Bästa delen av jobbet är att vi har inte varit bara arbetskollegor,vi va ju som familj,alla samarbetar,trivs med ordning och reda på jobbet .När vi är lediga,vi umgås,trefas vi ute och äter gott"
good,"issues with communication, treatment of some not handled well"
good,"Too much emphasis on using Skype to communicate. In my 5 months at CR Bard I never had one face-to-face meeting which included the on-site members of the ""team"" I was on. The plans to onboard me where awful. It took 3 days to get all the tools necessary to set up communications with the organization. As well I was given 77 SOP's to read within a 90 day time frame that as a consultant, should not have been mandatory."
good,You will spend the majority of your week scheduling and attending meetings with very little time for actual work. It becomes self fulfilling and cyclical.
good,The benefits are great and the compensation is fair. Unfortunately politics will determine if you advance. Most managers and supervisors are friends with others managers and supervisors that worked together previously.
good,"In terms of work place culture, BD talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk.  Looks great from the outside but is a powder keg waiting to explode.  Management is very detached from it's employees"
good,"Dont care about family all business and about office people making their bonuses."
good,Muy buena evaluación financiera de los negocios y estímulos al personal
good,"It's a very large company with slow processes. Leadership is absent. On the other hand, I like many of y co-workers, and have seen a lot of people retire after working decades there. If you really care about your work, then it's not a good company for you. It takes a lot of patience and listening to multiple stakeholders to get through any process there."
good,"Good welfare, heavy workload, colleagues not as friendly. Paper approval. Big organization. Work life balance. Inhouse cafeteria. Bonus and increment."
good,"In simple terms, BD cares ONLY about chasing dividends. Employee morale is not a consideration for management. Whatever talk they gave for it, they never walked it! Year after year after year of massive layoffs wears on us. Other that, people and products are amazing. Generally a very good culture (overshadowed by constant layoff fears). Obviously mixed feelings but ultimately the lip service to employees trumps my thoughts about this employer..."
good,"There was a routine to the work. You came in, performed the task you had prepared for the day before and then prepared for the next days task when you were done.  Predictable, constant and routine."
good,"Creo q fui muy buena trabajando "
good,"BD is a great place to work, there is work/life balance and there is a team atmosphere.  Everyone works together to complete a company goal.  There is focus on charitable work and donations."
good,"normal 9-5 job"
good,Integration into BD underway. Expect 12-18 months for complete integration. Communications during integration has been excellent on BD part but not a lot of detail.
good,"Supervisor did not want any of extrusion operators to excel, threatened by promotions to any of her operators.  extrusion operators are to hard to train."
good,Fun environment to work for including sports and activities.  Quarterly bonus.  Management and team leader in our department need to treat all employees fairly.
good,"i worked for bard for 3 years i did enjoy working for them they are not for people who dont work hard and take pride in there job, it can defiantly be stressful but 90% of the time you get weekends off which a lot of places dont"
good,over all i liked this job alot. the only problem is that a vast majority of employees are contact and the company WILL NOT convert people to full time. in my time at BD i watched alot of really great workers come and go because the director refused to convert people to permanent. it was a great experience but dont get your hopes up no matter what they tell you
good,Will work you seven days a week.  Would be a great place to work if PM was replaced.  Great people that care as to the product produced on the production floor
good,"As a BD employee, I enjoy the big corp biotech pharma presence which comes with high benefits and stability but if you work in IT, it's a whole different ballgame. The company core business is not in IT so there's not a lot of investment in growing IT department so you'll most likely have to face many rounds of re-org and outsourcing your job to cheaper and lower quality IT services."
good,"Work Life Balance is Difficult with 24/7 Commitment for Field Service Technicians. Company is moving positions out of San Diego in the Technical Center. Management is slow to respond to advancement requests, and advancement paths are not clear."
good,"Working closely with internal business and functional units to identify operational improvement opportunities and implement solutions in alignment with project strategies and business objectives."
good,"Advancement is a little tough with senior positions exclusively filled externally. Work life balance doesn't exist for field personnel. Job description says 50-75% travel but 100% is the norm while people are travelling to cities where others live. "
good,"good place to work."
good,very bad management. really cant advance much. pto policy sucks !they expect you to put your job before your kids. required to work many many long hours.
good,"A day at work at carefusion is filled with all sorts of challenges, you will never get bored, there are all kinds of people who work there, the hardest part of the job is to meet the ever growing demand with less and less employees, the most enjoyable part of the job is to be able to help people and find inventive ways to solve problems"
good,i am no longer in the employment with BD nevertheless i had had a wonderful time throughout my employment. Rather nice place of work though.
good,Bard does not foster understanding nor support required to meet everyday task. Leaders and what little support in the facility they have is stretched very thin and it shows in the lack of moral and stress with in the facility. My earlier time there was a great experience as time went on I felt the decline once plant management changed.
good,"Good place to work"
good,currently on a temporary assignment through Robert Half and we are paid a lot less through Robert Half staffing agency and the reason the manager want to pay less than other agency because the pay as a temporary employee is more than what is being offered on a permanent basis.
good,"Came in picked orders processed and shipped them to there destinations also learned how to operate a turret and picker, helped out other co- workers with the picking of parts and processing them for shipment. All in all it was a great work environment."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was the enormous amount of people, problems, products and projects I was exposed to over the years."
good,it was a nice place to work the only downfall i would say is their management is not very caring or understanding to sickness or family issues
good,"A typical day is filled with far more workload than one can effectively manage.   This environment has given me a great deal of learning opportunities but little in the way of work/life balance.    Low and Mid-level Management is for the most part good to work with however VP and higher level positions seem very disconnected from the day to day reality of the work that takes place.   The past several years have been filled with layoffs every 6-12 months and the workforce has been whittled away to almost nothing.  Those with strong knowledge of our systems have left for more enjoyable work environments leaving behind inexperienced individuals to fill their roles.   Co-workers are kind, caring and passionate about their jobs but often complain as they have been overloaded with work and employees live in fear of losing their jobs.   Customers are slowly losing their connection with the company due to declining customer focus and poor equipment performance."
good,Working with the engineering team. Assiting production on day to day issues. Supporting the maintenace and toolroom.
good,Great company culture. Needed more communication from management. New project implementation could've been managed more effectively.
good,"- Very fast paste work environment and physically demanding"
good,"Arrivée, prise des consignes et des priorités."
good,Carefusion is a small company with little room for advancement unless you are willing to move to San Diego where corporate is located.
good,"This company was a good place to learn new skills and break into the medical device industry.  After the spinoff, there were multiple layoffs that took it's toll on it's employees.  Job morale suffered and so did the customer support.  In order to advance you had to be proactive and find your niche or else you wouldn't be going anywhere.  I liked the people I worked with but then it just got too ""corporate"" and everything was just business."
good,Supervise 150 associates.  Working hard to have a team building shift.
good,"Production Operator, processed material to be tested for Tuberculosis and Micro-bacteria."
good,Kept to myself and tested equipment all day.  It was a nice environment in the hospital to work in.
good,"You do a lot of work for little pay, you go in there take calls from people who do not even want the product, you contact the doctor, you contact the insurance company, and at the end the company is out of network, this company needs to gain more business they turn away a lot of customers, and then after doing all this work they pay you out very poorly. the people very nice, met a lot of great people."
good,"CR Bard a 100+ year old company, struggling with massive changes in healthcare from recent healthcare bill and GPO challenges.  "
good,Management and staff always worked as a team. Eager to share knowledge and open to new ideas
good,I was able to work at my own pace. My management really trusted me to get the job done. I also helped out in our packaging dept. When needed. So the company trained me very well in many depts. So they could utilize me there if needed. I really enjoyed the fact that they gave me other opportunities in the workplace and trusted me to do that.
good,"A typical day of work at Becton Dickinson consisted of pulling samples,packing,assembly,filling out paper work, staging pallets, and sometimes helping prep media for medical testing tubes. I've learned how to pack out medical vials in a safe and efficient manner. I also learned how to use a torquing machine and work inside of a glove box. The management in the department that I worked in was very unprofessional,if I could of switched departments i most definitely would have. My co-workers were pretty okay, great team players. I didn't find the job hard at all, it was fairly easy once you got the paper work down. The most enjoyable part of that job was the overtime."
good,There is constant team work and a willingness to assist when needed
good,"The job was good, only down side was it was temporary they were hiring full time at the time of my employment with them which is coming up soon. It’s all morning shifts no nights, friendly people there which made work not as hectic"
good,Fair supervision. Easy work with decent pay. Horrible hours with plant restrictions. No smoking on the premises. Not a convenient job if you have friends or family
good,Good biomedical company to work for.  Very large and many moving pieces.  Benefits are comparable and immediate which is unusual in todays world but very welcome.
good,"It’s a good company, but the wage is too low. And I’m practicing electronic for a long time. So I’m interested to find a job where I’m doing testing, soldering and assembling materials."
good,"- Besides your routine work, there is always lots of initiative from leadership you need to be involved and action items to work on."
good,"The compensation for the job is stellar, if you are brought in as a full time employee. The working environment you'll experience is almost entirely based on your immediate manager, ranging from 'nearly no supervision' to 'micromanaged every second of the day'. Managers are also not required to have much (if any) knowledge on the tasks their subordinates actually perform and are merely there to track metrics. This makes it very difficult to get support when trying to defend poor numbers due to extenuating circumstances. Little-to-no room to grow within the company; the highest I've seen an agent reach is a lead position. Most internal movement of positions are lateral, but come with slight pay increases and are presented as promotions. They are not. A great starter job for those breaking into the IT world and looking to add experience to their resume, or those just looking for a comfortably paying 9-5 to grow complacent."
good,"Good learning opportunities. Very good mentor-ship following the VP, Program leaders to tag on the different leadership style. Culture in BD is very diverse"
good,Great benefits and other perks with the organization. But it is a very siloed environment. At times it can be difficult to work cross functionally. Overall very good processes in place as an organization.
good,"Field management lacking."
good,they pay was very worth the competitive hours. work was not steady most of the time you will be moved from one action to another during the day depending on needs
good,Working at the North America Share Service Center in San Antonio is a great opportunity to learn the transaction and process oriented side of a leading global manufacturer of medical devices/supplies. Rotational opportunities are available for those who perform and seek them out. Great place to start a career or perform a deep dive into a business process flow.
good,"	Organized and entered production and waste for eight divisions daily."
good,I’m not satisfied with the communication and the fact that there is very little care for employees. Drastic changes have been made and management never has answers to the questions and concerns  Employees have.
good,"This is my first job and I have learned here how to deal with senior and junior, how to highlight the work I can say I have learned basics of the job here, Workplace is good."
good,"BD is big and well established; this obviously has its advantages and disadvantages.  The company has a ton of resources to offer its employees and is quite a secure place to work.  That said, it can be difficult to actually get things done; the bureaucracy is strong and at times very frustrating."
good,"Staff and management were great! They were constantly involved with our well-being and ensured the employees were treated properly, including any concerns that we may had."
good,BD has given me the opportunity to develop my skills through the apprenticeship and into a career. They paid for additional training upon showing an interest in further training related to my position.
good,"I was selected to assist in the review of SOPs and Work Instructions as an outside entity to ensure the documents were easy to follow and covered what was actually being done to prepare for a Corp. Audit.  I was under a short term contract and I reported directly to the Head of Quality Assurance with my findings.  "
good,Good people.  Management wasn't that bad.  Clean place to work.  Pay was ok.  Café was nice and offered different options.  Convenient location.  Learned new skills
good,"to meet sales goals "
good,In the past this was a very good place to work from a compensation standpoint to a quality of life standpoint.  The company no longer exists as it was sold some years ago.
good,"A pesar de ser una organización global, las prácticas de promoción no son claras. Desafortunadamente, puede ser una compañía demasiado tolerante con el bajo desempeño y una estrategia débil en los aspectos de manufactura."
good,Nice lace to work.but very far from my place. I learned lot of thinks to do assembly and inventory experience. good people and good working culture. nice
good,"yes I worked there years ago, much has changed since then, you were once called buy your first name, not anymore, management are push push push for numbers that's the only thing they want to hear."
good,"A typical day at work: Good"
good,Good job Really enjoyed the travel of the pay was good the staff was great I had a good time learning all about the new software and how different hospitals operated.
good,The hardest part of this job was making sure that the hemas were wrapped correctly and there was enough racks to make it through the day to make it a productive day.
good,Nice building good atmosphere and good work environment. I am thankful for the opportunity. Great opportunity The company vision and direction and on point.
good,It is a very good paying job but it demands alot of time. Specially if yiu are on nights are really dont have a life outside of work. But you get w days off at a time
good,"I learned that it was very busy and there was no time for orientation."
good,"Good Job to make money. Direct staff treats contractors like poo as they feel very entitled with their PhD's. "
good,Overall a good Company to work for. Opportunity for advancement. Company was sold several times and that created some management confusion. Job advancement goals were often replaced after new management was introduced and forward path were not offer clear defined.
good,"This was 10 hour shifts, graveyard, Sunday to Wednesday nights. If there was  Overtime was the full ten hours on Thursday nights. A second person had sign off on everything done on the floor. This was manufacturing medical test product. If anything was wrong, the entire batch was thrown out. Everything absolutely had to be done correctly. This job was physically demanding, including lifting, standing and staying alert for the entire shift."
good,This place was ok to work for the pay was low and it was only temporary. I did actually like the job it just didn't offer many benefits and was temporary for 3+yrs.
good,The pay is great and the benefits are great but they do not allow time off and expect their employees to work everyday of the week.  You don't have a life outside of the place.  Not a place to work if you have a family.
good,I managed a team of 40+ associates to work safely and efficiently to meet monthly volume needs while staying within budget requirements. I have developed many new hire employees into proficient members of the team and I am also the department continuous improvement administrator for my department.
good,"In general, a nice place to work.  Lots of intelligent engineers and friendly co-workers around.  But BD has a very unfair bonus program.  It seems the upper level management does not really care whether or not smart engineers are leaving the company."
good,"Would be a great amazing place to work, as long as you're a full time employee and not a contractor.   Job advancement for contractors is little to zero."
good,Comfortable diverse working environment. Most enjoyable part of my job is effectively communicating and sharing medical knowledge with non-clinical working colleagues.
good,"Was a good environment to work in, all the people are friendly and helpful. However the company is going through huge financial instabilities, there have been a lot of layoffs and a lot if uncertainty as to the companies future at this location. With thst being said, woukd be best to look else where for employment."
good,"Large matrix organization with multiple layers of leaders.  A typical day at work is waking up and seeing what my customers are doing, what they need.  Spent large amount of time, 75%, in emails and conference calls."
good,"Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) is an American medical technology company that manufactures and sells medical devices, instrument systems, and reagents. Founded in 1897 and headquartered in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, BD employs nearly 50,000 people in more than 50 countries throughout the world.[2] In fiscal year ending September 30, 2009, 60% of BD sales were generated from non-U.S. markets."
good,"Old culture and career development process needs to be more affective. A lot of office perks (gym, dry cleaning, cafeteria, volley ball courts, basketball courts, etc.)"
good,"I love BD as a whole, great company to work for, but sadly there's little to no advancement opportunity. In order to grow with the company you have to be willing to relocate and occasionally you may have to stray from your career path if you're wanting more money."
good,"it's a very stable company to work for. "
good,"I enjoyed helping customers with understanding their medical supplies and ensuring they received their shipments on time. Our department was like a family, we looked out for each other. This is a company I would go back to work for again if it came down to it."
good,"Great work, great benefits... lacks training though, so there is a struggle. Company seems to be changing with regard to remote workers in IT. They are focusing on CA and perhaps TX area for prospective employees vs people who might be more of a better fit."
good,"The work pace is decent and feels like a routine sometimes. However the benefits are good and they match the 401k. They also have yearly bonus which is not a lot, but is something extra. I met good people there and also learned a lot from this place."
good,"Bard is a decent place to work, especially for the benefits. However, my experience in the area of job growth has been challenging. I believe there are some prejudices in terms of promotions and typically not performed fairly. Salaries are not given fairly as some departments are not respected thus the salary compensation is evidence."
good,"clinical sales, "
good,as a company makes you learn lot of aspect of order to cash and gave you chance to grow as a professional. and will cross train you on every LOP of the process
good,"BD is a good company to work for, however they were understaffed, so as I new person I didn't really receive the proper guidance for my overall development. People were helpful, but there was no real structure when it came to employee development."
good,"New desk startup"
good,Management is disrespectful  to employees they do not show professionalism in treating employees fairly. Management speaks in front of others on the floor about their personal feelings of employees and has no respect for a reps personal information.
good,OK company to work for. In the process of merging and culture changes so it is uncertainty. management doesn't have a clear road map and helping employee much.
good,"fun to learn medical device assembly, quality etc inspection of medical device, co workers are great. nothing hard part for job,"
good,"BD is a good place to work at if you are single with no family and no other forms of commitment as you will be spending a majority of your time at the plant. It is extremely fast paced and if you cannot keep up you will be left out. Co-workers in the night time really bond together to help each other out, however there are very few night workers so the crowd is thin and short supplied."
good,management is awful. they don't explain anything during the training before going to production. they take away hours the same day you go in. pay more to others
good,"Good management"
good,"Managed, administered and maintained cost and requirements database.  Trained Users on the system.  Worked with military, government and contractor personnel."
good,"Growing to fast thru acquisitions... "
good,"Daily operations run smoothly most days. If any issues arise, management and co-workers are part of  the resolution.  Hardest part of this job was keeping staff at capacity.  The most enjoyable part of this job was the many personalities of my co-workers."
good,"Boring and mindless work assembling and testing medical equipment."
good,"some of the things I learned was received constant web based classes on compliance SOX, HIPA, international work relations as well as IT related processes. my co-workers were a wonderful enjoyable group of people."
good,"It is a rewarding day knowing you are producing products that help people."
good,BD has been around over 100 years it has a mature workforce that is retiring and is bring in new blood to energize the product portfolio and workforce.
good,"As an intern, I was working on an independent project. I wish I got to experience what it was like working with others in the company rather than focusing on my own work."
good,"This company is moving to Mexico in about a month so this review doesn't really matter but its basically like the I Love Lucy episode where you have to pick and pack good parts off of a conveyor belt, except there are between 4 to 6 conveyor belts and you have to pack and inspect thousands of parts off of each and seal them up to send to final pack. So inspect, pack, weigh, seal, ship. Sounds good on paper, but it's a little harder than you'd expect. Also it builds up static like you wouldn't believe."
good,"Bard promotes quality, integrity, service, and innovation and inspires employees to perform their best. The company attracts goal oriented drivers who work hard and are fun to work with."
good,Many layoff's each year.  Exposure to new technologies and hardest part of your job will be to navigate office politics at such a large company.
good,Good company. Great opportunity for learning the pharmaceutical manufacturing business. This is a start up facility so things are still being properly fitted for the customer base. Large company and lots of room and opportunities for growth.
good,"flat organization with lots of politics, highly experienced and professional managers, a multiple executives to learn from."
good,"im learned here microbiology testing and validation , requlifiaction "
good,The company is going through a merger and many people are leaving and the back filling process is slow causing those who remain to pick up the slack.
good,"Billing patients invoices, team meeting daily and interaction with other team members. Learned"
good,"Support and Mentor Integration Engineers"
good,"Em relação a sua administração é muita prestativa,"
good,"Nothing special, very middle-of-the-road place to work.  A fair deal of paperwork because of the medical device industry."
good,Standing on my feet for hours at a time. Sometimes even  12 hours for 6 straight days in a row.
good,Good structure and great training. Learned about managing a database.
good,Lots of work but little or no recognition of a job well done. Management is helpful as are your co-workers.
good,Highly fast paced working environmt. Over saw and operated 30 molding presses and molds.
good,"Liberator Medical Supply is a privately owned company that looks good on paper but the overall atmosphere is divided. Either you're one of the pets or you are just a number. The benefits are expensive and don't cover family if they have a pre-existing condition. Very sad because most of the people there are hard working, dedicated people. The Management/Owner should see the gold that they possess in the people that work for them and take better care of them. I suppose that in this day and age workers are a dime a dozen so it doesn't really matter how you treat them."
good,Challenging environment with the one thing you should always expect to adhere to; change.  Be receptive and look forward to always striving to the outmost best of your abilities.
good,ok.  If you speak French.  English speakers don't bother to apply.
good,good culture people work well with one another. I enjoy the people and the culture. Low pressure.
good,"Was a ok place to work. Co-workers were great, and local and middle management did a good job, but I felt like upper management wasn't always being honest with the field or listening to our customers."
good,"Great place to work and good mangement. Large amount of employees, good benefits, and amentities."
good,"Very conservative company, with an overall great fiscal record. People are very helpful. However, advancement is very limited, as the average seniority is 19 years."
good,I took the 4 month contract in the hope that their would be enough work to hire me on full time.
good,Commercial collections for medical supply company. Handled all doctors offices and clinics collections. Credit holds and account setup.
good,"Learned high end collections in a fast pace, stressful work place."
good,CareFusion has some wonderful people working there but they are trying to build versions in parallel using different teams. This can really mess things up when the appropriate versioning is not followed.They are also very tight on time-off for family issues.
good,"I enjoyed working with the company, but the managers showed a lot of favoritism with different employee."
good,Customer focused
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is doing what we do...providing life saving medical equipment and supplies to hospitals.
good,I would difinately work for this department again. The management was always striving to get you where you needed to be and the environement was full of positive energy. I loved walking into work and enjoyed working with this department. I will miss the relationships that I have bulit here.
good,"Bard has created a nice work environment. IT is in the process of farming out its work, cost cutting, and laying off employees as many companies are doing. If you are in other departments of the company the jobs are very secure and it is a nice company to work for."
good,"People need to spend around eight and a half hours in the office. Being fresher, I have learned a lot. People are open, knowledgable and ready to help kind. Management is also good. Workplace culture is a good kind of formal and friendly also."
good,Boa mas tem que ser amigo da chefia pra ir pra frente
good,If you end up in a good department things can go pretty well. If your a hard worker expect more work because you have to pick up other peoples slack and there are many workers that cant perform their job to help ease the work load.
good,"A empresa é um local agradável de trabalhar, porém os funcionários não conseguem separar a vida pessoal com a profissional. Uma das coisas que o setor administrativo deixou a desejar foi, saber usar o jovem aprendiz, tanto no aprendizado como no dia a dia."
good,The pay is incredible for the town and the cost of living. I usually learned something new everyday. Management is some departments was good but most management never kept there employees informed. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the lazy people and them taking long breaks when they where not allowed. I loved to be hands on and in my position that was an every day occurrence.
good,"Hard to be innovative when you have an itty bitty slice of a product. As an intern, you have very limited roles and responsibilities, so that impacts it a fair bit."
good,"As a remote working employee, I was able to manage my travel and work hours.  The territory was regional so not a lot of travel was required.  The high up management was good to work with and focused on employee engagement. My immediate manager was focused mostly on process vs. client needs/success."
good,"Great place to work and wonderful opportunities. I had several opportunities for growth which were greatly appreciated. After the CEO left during my tenure, the new leadership brought in their own staff."
good,"Nice Place To Work, If Your Actually Through The Company Verses An Agency. Easy Work, Nice Hours And Nice Pay To Be Through A Temp Agency. I Would Of Love To Be Hired On."
good,"Hard to do your job, company has locations world wide and a lot of people have input as to what you can or cannot do which can slow things down. There is little or no training everything is on the hold training."
good,"Good work/life balance. No Micro Managers. Nice office environment. Good place to work. Eventhough there is Continous work, it is not stressful. Have lots of opportunity to learn."
good,"Company not proactive about hiring - always behind the curve on service engineers. results in engineers travelling 75% of the time working in excess of 70 hours a week, almost every week. work never stopped as you get e-mails, texts & calls even when off duty or on vacation. management did not know what the job entailed, and didn't try to gain the insight to what went on every day."
good,"Employees are treated well, with respect, and compensation is good. Product development moves at a crawl because targets are routinely changed by upper management. Midline managers are not trusted to make real decisions, which is too bad because there's some really sharp guys that are being ignored. Marketing is a white ivory tower that hands down seemingly arbitrary decisions, very Dilbert. Projects are developed, then scrapped. Deadlines are routinely driven over like road kill with no apparent consequences; we just move on."
good,"No good.  Bard was bought out by a larger Healthcare company and left 1200 employees unemployed.  Was a very stressful time for all of us, and eventually they ended up closing the doors and moving the entire operation to Illinois."
good,"When I first started at BD it was a great place to work and learn.  As the years went on, constant changes in management led to constantly shifting priorities and abandoned initiatives.  Organizational structure was constantly shifting in IT.  Most recently, most all of IT has been outsourced."
good,"Nice gym (with trainers) in each building, sand volleyball courts, and different BD sponsored leagues to play in. The summer sand volleyball tournament is a great way to meet people within the company."
good,Bonne entente avec mes collaborateurs. on sent un esprit d'équipe entre les différents service.
good,Excellent benefits with a variety of options to choose from.  Very conservative environment which could be a struggle for someone who is tactfully vocal.
good,"A typical day "
good,"Das Unternehmen wächst stetig, jedoch die Löhne nicht im Vergleich."
good,"Lots of positive changes in a small space of time"
good,Great place to work for certain people. Younger people without families and want to make great money it is a good job. People with familes dont get much time off.
good,"It was a nice work place environment. My only real complaint would be how management kept us, including our shift supervisor, in the dark for many things. I worked the night shift and our main supervisor said she will have a meeting with us next week to give us an update on the state of the company, Instead, the night shift was let go on the spot. "
good,Bard porvides/affords the opportuniyt to understand full accountability of sales and sales expectations.  The companies products fulfill the needs of the interventional nephrologist working with access issues related to the dialysis market.
good,The individuals that I worked with made the job most satisfying. A typical day at work was very busy dealing with medical supplies and trying our best to get these supplies out to customers despite sometime rapid insurance benefit changes.   The hardest part of the job no doubt was the inability to take care of a customer.  The most enjoyable part is a happy customer.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and wish I could stay permanently - but unfortunately, they rely on contractors to do the bulk of the work....and they hardly ever release headcount to make those contractors full-time employees - even though the departments where they work are extremely busy. They will rotate temps in the same position for years. Not sure why - but my guess is to look better to shareholders (less headcount=less cost). About 1/3 of the staff at it's world HQ are temps, contractors, or freelancers. "
good,"I worked full-time for BD medical Shanghai branch in China. This company provided some interesting and very helpful activities/lectures. It always promotes healthy life and some medical knowledge which is meaningful."
good,"It is not a bad place to work. A lot of information sharing. you learn a lot about insurances that you would typically not know about. It is a team oriented setting. Co-workers are nice and friendly. I like working there because you get to gain a lot of knowledge you would otherwise not know about when it comes to insurance. Getting to know what will be paid, what will not be paid, and so on is very important to people who need the services Liberator offers."
good,"*Traveling throughout the State of Florida Including other parts of the country installing various types of secure med station equipment at Hospitals environment and Pharmacies. "
good,"Cons- Too top heavy.  Do as I say but not as I do environment.  "
good,"My group in the systems engineering department at BD focused on research and development of new technologies in the medical devices field. My boss would introduce new ideas to us and then try to implement them. My role in the group was to use MATLAB to create scripts and prototype programs to help the group efficiently analyze their results."
good,CareFusion is a great company where you are able to provide value-added analysis via cross-functional projects in addition to the recurring monthly close process.
good,"BD has been around for 100+ years and in many ways the processes and management fit this mold.  It's a financially driven company that is typically #1 or #2 in all of the categories it plays in.    While it innovates, it is extremely risk averse and tends to develop products that are in the comfort zone. It's an R&D/Operations company that is trying to build it's capabilities in marketing.  In late 2011 it hired a CMO, who's helping BD better understand it's customers and develop products that address their needs instead of products that engineers could make.  Employee training and development is minimal and getting a good manager is hit or miss.  I like the people I work with but I'm not inspired by management or the company's products.  There is no clear career path and while they are trying to focus on building talent this is still very much a work in progress."
good,Good overall place to work as most people are very nice and pleasant to work with. Company does try to treat their employees right. Like most other old manufacturing focused firms - they are slow to react!
good,"I was aquired as a Customer Complaint Coordinator in a lift and shift transition in which San Antonio was to become the hub of complaint resolution. Complaints were to come from the four major busineeses that compose BD and arrive from varies areas throughout the US. Although the importance of knowledge capture was strongly iterated over and over by the project managers, the managers of the departments that were to supply the knowledge allowed personnel that knew the process to depart the organization before the knowledge was captured. It was a very confusing and stressful process. There was a constant power struggle between project managers and department heads."
good,good work life balance however. Salaries are below market value
good,Learned a lot and had fun working there;
good,"A typical day at work: Managing emails and meetings. I also provide process and system expertise to a young staff; this includes supporting the Warehouse Manager, Director of Operation and Supervisors. Currently I am working on an SAP upgrade project - The good portion of my day is spent working with a larger cross functional team, both in Canada and the US, in setting up process and data for the distribution center to support the SAP upgrade from 4.0 to 6.0."
good,"The projects you will work on at CareFusion are exciting and intriguing. You get a real sense of pride in knowing that your work directly improves the level of healthcare that patients receive. The compensation is very competitive and the facilities are wonderful. The leadership however, is lacking. There is a large amount of turnover and re-organization going on in the company. This leads to a large amount of politics within the individual departments and also a large amount of ""directors"" looking out for their own necks. While the majority of the people you will meet here are professional, your experience here will undoubtedly be affected by the poor and ineffective leadership."
good,"My sales team and RBM are all great to work with. I especially enjoy being in hospitals where staff members are having difficulty with a product, and I am able to turn them around to ""loving"" it. I think that the hardest part of the my job is finding out on a Friday after ""business hours"" where I am flying to on Monday morning and being gone for the entire week. Lots of planning for very little turn around time."
good,"A NEVERENDING amount of information that they can never fully train you for because operations are always changing and new curveballs come at you every day that not even the management knows how to handle sometimes. The pace is grueling and you are always behind, which results in constant weekend overtime pressure. You will be considered a bad worker if you don't cheerily agree to weekend overtime, regardless of the circumstances. So the only ""good workers"" in their eyes are the ones who work 7 days a week. The benefits are good, the facility is wonderful and clean, the co-workers are incredibly nice and helpful -- because they HAVE to be. Positivity is one of the very biggest things they hire for because they know stress is huge at this job. The pay is okay but should be higher for what they demand. It's very software intensive and not all the workers have college experience, so a lot of mistakes are made. As soon as I thought I was getting ""good"" at the job, a new and totally unexpected scenario would get thrown in front of me and often no one (including my manager) knew how to handle it. Thankfully, all the customers are business contacts and internal installers, so they're almost all very polite and professional. But the company product lines are so numerous and ever-changing that we would get questions every day that no one knew how to answer, causing jobs to get backed up and customers to get upset. The overall operation puts too much faith in off-the-street workers with no education to handle complex SAP and Excel operations. Many employees look like Trump giving a speech:"
good,"Had good time and enjoyed corporate life. But not at all enjoyed the work life. Learned the work and process of the company."
good,The environment is more relaxed and you can take your laptop home to work and you can make your own schedule. There are team building activities but my group lacks participation.
good,"Still working through integration between 3 compnies and will take time to establish one company culture.  In the meantime, the work is challenging but fair."
good,Enjoyed my job very much with equipment and fellow employees. Management changed three years ago. The new management swept through with new policies that were heavy handed.
good,"The company overall is a great company to work for, but the people make the experience. The works days may seem long and some days are better then others."
good,"BD use to take care of their employees. That changed about 5 or 7 years back. Everyone became a number, there are hundreds of lay offs every year. They have invested their money in remodeling the Franklin Lakes campus instead of ensure their workers kept their jobs."
good,I learned a lot as to running machines and working well with other people. I would still be employed there if the company had no relocated out of the country.
good,"Provide technical support via email or phone "
good,"I was in outside sales in a home office environment.  A typical day was visiting my customers; Hospital SPD Management and personnel, O.R. Nurses, Purchasing, Materials Management, Surgeons.  Uncovering needs and providing products and services to add value to their Departments."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, dificil promocion para otros puestos."
good,Great potential to establish mid management career.  The biggest challenge is formalizing the tribal knowledge and eradicating variations to process.
good,"Es una empresa que ofrece estabilidad laboral, multinacional, lo que permite viajes e intercambio de experiencias con colegas en el extranjero."
good,"Decent workplace with good management."
good,I have worked here for a year and a half while going to school. I work the weekend shift and I am off for the week to do school and work on things I need while most businesses are open. I am almost done with school and they do not offer any jobs in my career field.
good,"I have enjoyed working with BD for my 5 years with them.  The company is very stable and pay/benefits is just as good, if not better, than competitors.  There is a culture of respect and accountability and a relatively open environment for progression."
good,"current global health economic woes have caused an even more stringent cost culture. understandable, but be careful that cost decisions are made after appropriate analysis, and not based solely on short term goals."
good,- Kontroll av passagesystem
good,"Atuando na empresa há dez anos, adquiri experiência e centralizei a maior parte do tempo de atuação na área da Garantia da Qualidade. Sendo assim, a importância em dar visibilidade nos processos, ser pró-ativo e buscar o aprendizado contínuo e versátil tem sido acrescentada a cada dia em minha carreira profissional e vida pessoal. Meus relacionamento com meus companheiros e com o corpo gerencial é extremamente respeitoso e agradável, pois entendo a importância do trabalho em equipe."
good,"Co-workers are great people. Work is steady pace, very good life work balance."
good,Work is consistent with other companys in the field. SOPs and TM dont always make a ton of sense. Science isn't necessarily up to scruff. Investigations take the easy way out instead of trying to solve actual issues.
good,"Learned alot, most employees are professional. Some not so much thats where the drama comes in. Management doesn't always do what is needed or necessary."
good,"Great company to work for.  Great products, great employees.  No rooms for career advancement.  It was great working for the company until I got assigned to a real bad manager."
good,"Pay isn’t all that great, but it’s very relaxed. You aren’t over worked like crazy, although as an engineer you do more paperwork than engineering, which gets frustrating. Other than that it’s a great place if you aren’t super motivated to work hard or advance your career."
good,Work is fast paced and continuous. The culture is helpful and eager to improve. Management is overworked and is mostly unable to actually perform management due to busy admin schedule.
good,The job was very easy and everyone was extremely helpful but the biggest problem for me was the language barrier and we didn't deal with any customer service
good,"Management were always will help and answer question, people were great to work with."
good,Enjoyed working at Carefusion. My co-workers were great to work with.  Management was awesome.
good,"BD has a great future ahead in medical device. It is a stable company and is still growing. Fast paced company, data oriented, six sigma approach and statistically driven"
good,Working at BD was a learning experience. Good managament at first then management begin to fail at most people expectation. Quality work was very much what i expected. My manager was very caring and very forward kind of person not letting things get out of hand before handling the problem.
good,"One of many companies I worked for maintaining the majority of the work force through many years, myself working a total of 34 years always striving to contribute the best of my abilities"
good,"I would answer two different phone lines, my job was very fast pace and fun. I would open and sort all mail. Complete projects,enter in AOBs, clean workstation,greet guest. Schedule Interviews. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,a typical day is okay I learned to be humble management was the workplace  culture is mixed with all type of people there is no hard part of the job I loved the people
good,"BD was a great place for money. They have great pay, and great bonuses on a quarterly basis, The best day was the day we decided it was time for me to go, It is a very stressful place and the training needs improvement, If they didnt make medical equipment the pay wouldnt be as great. It all comes down to a hospital charging you $100 for an aspirin. Facility is very clean, climate controlled. Management was great to me, understanding and easy to get along with on almost any issue. The problems are some of the lead people below management, they have alot of authority and could throw you under the bus for anything. Something you had nothing to do with could suddenly include your name. They have a fairly high turnover. I should have left long ago but its tough tot turn away from $50-$60K a year. My ADVICE---- GET A GREAT TRAINER!!!! Someone you feel a bond with..."
good,"Coworkers are amazing. Like that we had a peets coffee on site, didn't like that we had to pay for everything."
good,Great organisation with great values. Had enough and more opportunity to learn and contribute. I thoroughly enjoyed the training opportunities
good,"I was with the company a little over a year. The management did not have any management skills, the took working reps and promoted them to management wit no skills or training. The pay was not good. They expected you to be a robot and never have any family time or emotions. It was never about the customers and always abut the money. No mater what, they always made sure they got paid. They don't care about their employees. There is favoritism in every department and cliches all around. We are handled more than what we were paid for. Loved the company but the management needs work."
good,"I did receive experience in forklift and shipping and receiving, but management was poor, difficult to balance life/work, due to the 1 to 2 hour they would give us for mandatory overtime, so if I worked til 6 pm at 5 pm they would tell me I have to stay. I did however meet a lot of wonderful people. Since I left they are now under new management."
good,Pocos beneficios sociales y sueldo bajo para trabajar a turnos.
good,It was a great company if you was working directly for that company. But working with the company as a temp/contract worker is horrible. you never know from this day to that day if you have a job.
good,Undervalued and underrecognized good employees and their achievements.  Pandering to the slow kids in an overly politically correct culture of 'diversity'... Departmental arrogance is abound.
good,"Very fast pace work environment, managers have there own agendas not aligned among them self's. Work culture is very reactive no consistency from day to day activities."
good,Becton & Dickinson located in Franklin Lakes New Jersey  is a good place to work. But new changes in management  is making very competitive environment.
good,Pay is ok if you are just starting your career. Good Place to learn customer service skills if you are just starting out. Not a place for career advancement or if you are looking to stay a long time.
good,"Low moral, hard to work with people with bad attitudes and no hope!! Sorry about this section, I am not one who talks a lot, I just answer the questions straight to the point."
good,"As an employee of Adecco Medical and Science for CareFusion, I am acknowledged as an effective Clinical Product Educator,  Presently, I provide in-service education and troubleshooting follow up for the Alaris Safety Software System.  "
good,The amount of change has been difficult for the organization to establish a new blended identity. The major acquisitions has proved to be very challenging for the establishment of a cohesive workforce and has created numerous silos and protecting of turfs and turf  battles. The leaders have yet to figure out and rebuild the culture that is critical to function effectively.
good,"I actually enjoyed working for BD. sure the hours were a lot, but they were never more than 3 days in a row. the schedule worked out lime this: 3 days on, 2 days off, 2 days on, 3 days off, basically it was every other: lets say today is Friday, if you worked today you would have next Friday off, but the Friday after that you would have back on, and so on, and so on."
good,"Always learning new things, hard to move to a different position.  Very demanding. Its demanding for overtime. Its a great job if all your in for is the money!"
good,No surprises working for this company.  They are straight forward with their expectations.  High volume of business is conducive of high stress situations.
good,"Bästa delen handlar om att ha förmånen att vara och förhandla och umgås med kunder och partners på den internationella marknaden och att resa internationellt, och att därigenom få kontakter på alla nivåer inom de företagen, från ledningen till alla avdelningar under dem, mycket stimulerande och lärorikt."
good,"Typical day at work was rush,rush,rush! Every contract needed prompt attention and you were always busy. Hardest part of my job was trying to control the level of stress. I mostly enjoyed my co workers and the reps I worked with."
good,"1.Visiting doctors, Medical shops, stockists and sub stockists."
good,"Todos os dias aprendo na BD, pois é um bom lugar pra trabalhar. Ela tem muito valor, com ética que é importante hoje no mercado! A parte mais complicada seria a vida pessoal x trabalho, onde sinto que não dão muito valor a isso! As pessoas são amigáveis e estão sempre prontas a ajudar quem chega."
good,"Large employer in a small city, so as a new employee I was informed to be mindful that many people working there were related to other employees. "
good,"Wasn't that much of a good paying job for what we had to do<its a real new fun expirience. Did learn some new techniques in working there, Manager are good help on what you need good clean organized staff"
good,"I was a temp, and the management had the temp agency under the impression that the position i was working was temp to perm,,,in reality it was a permanent temp position."
good,"I was employed at BD for 14 years and enjoyed my job a lot,but the management there has a hard time making decisions and sticking to it."
good,Peers and colleagues are great to work with.  Management too often stressed and burdened subordinates with same stress.  Unprofessional management and need better defined roles on do's and don'ts of management. ie:  management does not gossip or whine to subordinates
good,"It is a Medical Devices Company. "
good,"Limited opportunity for growth, unless you are willing to relocate to New Jersey. Benefits are great, company is doing relatively good in the market"
good,"A typical day at BD packing materials, working and a team setting. I learned how to fill out paper work which was the hardest part of job. As far a my co-workers by far the best people I've have ever worked with. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers and them putting a smile on my face."
good,"BD è risultata azienda multinazionale, con struttura piramidale e in alcunme occasioni poco recettiva alle istanze di mercato nazionale e europea"
good,"I have loved what I do for this company. "
good,"Este tipo de trabajoes bueno por que aprende uno hacer muchas cosas, pero muy mal pagado, y no oportunidad de crecer.., Compañeros muy bueno y cooperativos es parte de las reglas de trabajo, trabajo en equipo"
good,"Carefusion can be a great place to work and at times a very frusting place to work. I had a field postion, so I was involved with the customer service side of Carefusion. There was a lot autonomy mixed with rigid schedules, So you had to be very flexible. Most people did have a hourly position, but there are no times clocks. Yor pretty much set your own schedule in order to keep up with the demands of customers."
good,It was a great job experience it helped me learn to move faster. And be more accurate. You to concentrate and watch where u put ur surgical supplies they have to go into certain spots.
good,"The company is fun to work for generally, nice level of challenge and helpfulness from most people. Low level management is great, but higher level management seems hypocritical to have such high expectations of action from teams when they themselves are the slowest and least productive in enacting the most impactful change that requires their action. Also, this company is rushing to run as lean as they can with respect to resources and employee accommodations which I predict will make them less and less desirable to work for in the future."
good,Bd was friendly environment.  I learned how to maintain and ran machines that assembly syringes and learned the importance of paying attention to detail..
good,L'environnement de travail est top et le personnel en place aussi de très bon collègue de travail toujours prêt a s'aider mutuellement par contre une direction déplorable qui n'accepte aucune critique et qui ne juge pas ces employés sur leur valeur de travail mais plutôt par affinité et copinage ce qui est regrettable...
good,A lot has changed. It has its good n bad just like any job. I work hard and have been trained for a lot but I’ve been working for five years and I have yet to level up in pay
good,Empresa multinacional extremamente profissional na gestão
good,Company as a whole is a good place but under certain leadership is something to desire.  Benefits are good compare to others.  Certain culture still hasn't changed even thought we are supposed to be one BD.
good,Fairly new to the company and was very excited to be a part of it then integration hit and the work dynamic and management now is a true nightmare.  Here's hoping it gets better but many are not sticking around to see
good,"+известный бренд, международная компания"
good,They had great teamwork and very mannered. They cared about your health and safety. They are very laI'd back and easy to talk to if something comes up that you have to take care of.
good,"This is an overall good place to work."
good,"Muy buena empresa aunque los jefes son muy inhumanos, no se preocupan por su personal"
good,"I would recommend Becton Dickinson (BD) as a good place, opportunity for entry level, and growth opportunity.  If have experience, and history it is not often used and/or recognized.  The company is strong, stable and has a great product line."
good,Large medical company with extensive healthcare customer base.  Pay and benefits are average for the type of business.  Inter-company advancement can be a challenge.
good,"Temp assignments OK; very short-term.  Good assignments for in-between assignments, etc.  Dependent upon contracts with various local hospitals for equipment installations/upgrades."
good,big company with movement opportunities.  Great work/life balance  not super progressive  structured  movement slow   good benefits fair comp could be more creative
good,"Medical Dispensing Implementation: Company is always busy and very fast paced. Low level management is poor at best. Upper management has a clear focus but struggles to have oversight at lower levels. Expectations from project management vary , some do great, some just phone it in."
good,"En charge de la réponse aux appel d'offres sur le secteur géographique dont je suis responsable, j'identifie pro-activement les points critiques, élabore l'offre, cordonne les services concernés afin de répondre dans les délais impartis. J'ai également en charge plusieurs missions transverses. Mes objectifs individuels sont liés à ma contribution à l'avancement des projets en cours et ma participation à la démarche qualité et à l’amélioration continue du service."
good,Rather flexible hours. To much nepotism and no room for advancement. The building was always cold due to malfunctioning A/C.
good,"When Carefusion spun off of Cardinal Health, the leadership & culture was great.  Vision and mission was super simple ""Right Medication, to the Right Patient, at the Right Time"". There was room to soar and advance.  After acquisition by BD the culture and leadership went down hill.  A stodgy East coast company purchasing a So Cal company not the best fit.  Leadership is very poor, makes horrible decisions and there is no accountability for these poor decisions.  Tons of favoritism and nepotism like behavior.  Salary good. Work life balance is good.  The parking lot is empty at 5:00pm."
good,"It's not relevant to write a review on a company you may have worked for over ten years ago, things change, people change and management changes, please delete."
good,Great Culture and people. Communication was not as great. Was there as a contractor and it seemed that the employees were really happy with BD
good,Im proud to be a part of BD India although it was a short work experience b ut I have learned alot and thankful to all the seniors and coworkers for their support and motivation.
good,". Always have projects to work on before Becton Dickson acquisition"
good,Very fast paced. Great place to work. Management was very by the book.
good,"Good company to work for but, there was no room for advancement."
good,Good company along with people. Wrote validation and test protocols for the tooling department. Interface with local and international vendors
good,"evaluacion regular puesto que la cultura a nivel jefaturas es elitista, se rige de acuerdo a status social y esto implica discriminacion a diferentes grupos inferiores y por ende la posibilidad de promociones es asignada regukarmente a grupos cercanos que se rigen por aspectos sociales fuera de la empresa."
good,Good place to work but no advancement available when in Sales.
good,"At CareFusion, I had the opportunity to learn about ventilators while visiting numerous medical facilities around the United States. CareFusion provides an excellent opportunity for many recently graduated biomedical technicians. "
good,"Old Company trying to make positive changes. Manic activity but actual changes come very slowly."
good,"I'd like to see more women advance outside the quality department. You must be open to changes. Helping people live healthier lives. Excellent pay, pension, & benefits."
good,I really don't have much to say about the company it was an ok work place i loved the people i worked with. Thats what made the job ok. On a day to day i woud take about 90 or more calls and input about 200 orders in te system
good,"I worked in rework and that was an easy job. Keep up with your work and you'll be fine, it's nothing too hard and easy to get the hang of. The condition is extremely hot though, so I would recommend bringing water or Gatorade and making sure you stay cool."
good,"The pay was wonderful. The benefits were also really good. Very strict policy on sick leave. Don't get involved in the gossipsing and just do your job. The ""lifers"" out there run the show and they'll let you know it too."
good,Great place for opportunities volunteering in the community. Great benefits. Work life balance and able to work with school schedule. Parking is sometimes difficult when coming back from lunch.
good,"I got a great manager which is always setting goals provided on the opinion of everyone on the team. We work numbers, so every day you need to meet at least a minimum but it is a reasonable goal. I enjoy working due that you can modify your schedule if needed for picking up kids at school or doctors appointments."
good,Great products and people to work with.  Independently lead your customers through education and workflows designed for a safer environment.  Freedom in your day.
good,"Worked as a contract employee through another tech, the job on contract has high starting pay per hour but lacks benefits. Contract employee's are also not provided a lot of the same tools, software, and benefits as actual care fusion employee's."
good,"BD/Carefusion was filled with rewarding challenges due to the fact it was comprised of two major companies merging together. The educational value of these great challenges were very fulfilling o my personal growth. I wouldn't say over all the company was without its flaws, but out of those flaws I learned a lot in a short amount of time."
good,"Work environment is good,Atmosphere could be more upbeat.Good company to learn different applications. Most people are friendly ans supportive.Good Work Life Balance."
good,"-Plusieurs domaines d'activités "
good,This company has great benefits and is a great company to work for.  It is growing and there are may opportunities available at this company.  They encourage advancement and cross training.
good,"Overall is an average Company for Technical level Employees, response is average slow to issues as is advancement and Salary upgrades. Life work balance is ok and Benefits are also ok.  There is a lot of Dead Wood in the Ranks that impedes newer workers from advancing, "
good,"Supporting 24/7 where required, can be stressful and seems unrelenting, however, benefits package is very good.  I work in a global team which is very diverse."
good,"a good place to work, but a lot of jobs are now being sent to other countries.  work-life balance is good, compensation is good, job security is poor."
good,"Good people to work with, a quality medical device manufacturer, dedicated to the health and outcomes for patients using devices.  Good benefits, good educational opprotunities"
good,BD is a big player in low value consumables medical device and technology.  It has manufacturing facilities in many parts of the world with business diversified in primary & secondary medical care.
good,"great pay and benefits. twelve hour shifts with almost endless possibility for overtime. two shifts, first seven am to seven pm and second shift seven pm to seven am. rotating schedule every two weeks."
good,"Managerial support.  Able to work as a team and independently  "
good,"BD gives good benefits but upward mobility for coloreds is nonexistent. BD needs to pay attention to that if it wants to make the company attractive. Holidays, annual meetings and employee socialization are nonexistent."
good,"I only worked here for a week and a half as a contractor, but there was a really great cafeteria, similar to what you might find on a college campus (grill, hot meals, etc.). Onsite gym for full-time employees."
good,"Becton Dickinson was a great place to learn and hone your skills. However, the management had a set way of operating and they were often unwilling to alter their mindset."
good,"Typical day you could have nothing to do or you may run all day long."
good,"Dinâmica, trabalho em grupo, responsabilidade social."
good,部分工作流程有少许不稳定，时常要接触不是本身工作范围以外的工作。影响了工作甚至无法在准确时间內完全，导致要在加班时来完成。电脑系统化无安排在培训，很难自我增值。
good,"Technical and professional organization that keeps up with"
good,"BD has too many projects for the R&D organization to complete. This might be seen as a good thing, but when resources are constant and the project number increase there are trade-offs that have to be made."
good,"Worked as a contractor and the job security was unstable. The job was challenging, yet interesting at the same time. Travel requirements for the position is 90% which began to be too much."
good,"All mergers and disruptions cause waves, however, current management is not response to the work force. This is resulting in  low morale and good people are leaving. Need reality check."
good,The call volume is very high.  A lot of migrations for different appications.  It a busy place to work and you don't have to worrie about it being too slow pace.
good,"The location of the office was right in the middle of rush hour traffic.  However, that did not matter too much because I was always on the road.  The people were fine."
good,"Empresa en crecimiento, con muy buenas bases, personal eficiente y con orientacion a superacion diaria."
good,This was a great first co op for a college student.  Working here was a great introduction into corporate America.  The work in my opinion was too monotonous.
good,"In R&D most days have different requirements.  You learn to be flexible, open to new ideas and able to communicate well with different engineers from various departments like Mechanical Hardware, Software, the Production Lab, Customer Service, etc...  You have to be able to work autonomously and be observant and ready to give the engineer valuable feedback from testing."
good,BD can be a tough environment for a newcomer. it seems rarely that newcomers are put in the best position to succeed though high expectations are placed upon their sholders.
good,"Gaining employment with C R Bard has been a very fulfilling experience for me. Learning that the person right next to you could be wearing a medical device that is essential to every day life function is somewhat shocking. So many things that come naturally to me are taken for granted. This position opened my eyes to that fact and many more. At some point in our lives we ave all needed some type of medical assistance. Whether it was major or minor. I learned that in the Medical Equipment field, not all medical equipment is considered a necessity. Though this is considered incorrect, they should be. Anytime your bodily functions are not functioning the equipment is necessity. It is so difficult having companies turn down patient prescriptions, due to insurance reasons. Somethings we have no control over. Those that we do however, are very enlightening. Making sure patients are receiving services and things are functioning properly, is the most rewarding feeling ever. I can honest say that I know that I have helped changed lives."
good,I enjoyed going to work everyday and challenging myself with every task that was assigned for me. I got to work with great co-workers where I learned how to be a team player and be a part of a team effort milestone achievement.
good,J'ai effectué une année en apprentissage chez BD. L'environnement de travail est très agréable et dynamique. Une expérience très positive pour mon développement personnel et professionnel.
good,"There are many divisions of this company. I am an home based field service engineer for the diagnostics division based in the Baltimore area. So, I can't really comment to much on the corporate workings, but it does appear everyone is happy."
good,Great place to work where employees are well respected and encouraged to help improve patients' lives. Strong social investing position. Good team work.
good,"One of the best and highest paying jobs I've ever had. I love that I don't have a manager breathing down my neck all day ""micromanaging"" me. However, many have been affected by recent lay-offs since BD acquired CareFusion...I am one of them!!!"
good,I have enjoyed working at Carefusion with management team and peers but  the company was sold and the doors are closing soon.
good,Working at BD during their transition period and merger with Care Fusion was very interesting and for the most part a great learning and growing experience.  As with any corporate mergers transitioning people and processes takes time and can be challenging and political posturing and shared consensus on what is best  .  They are on the right track and once things are decided upon a systems and commonality platform processes should fall in line .
good,The work was very rewarding and the customers and co-workers were fantastic. Management was uneven and disconnected and were prone to micromanagement.
good,"The company treats everyone with care and respect. My role is very transactional, with heavier volume at month end closing."
good,"Good work life balance"
good,"- able to learn and improve yourself"
good,"- From this company I had learn how to write an Standard Work Instruction, Test Procedure, Blueprint of On-The-Job Training"
good,BD is a leading medical product company.  They manufacture everything from complex diagnostic instruments to cell culture media to billions of disposable medical devices.
good,"Good company to for. Supplied training, communication and good management. travel sometimes takes a toll on the employee. Yearly company meetings were fun."
good,"Great six Years at BD. First Job out of college. decent amount of red tape and politics, and poor management. Would not recommend going here as a young professional."
good,alto conocimento en montaje y puesto a punto de líneas de montaje
good,BD is a solid ethical company. No one will every ask you to do something that might be unethical.  In San Diego there are few employers that provide such a solid place to work.
good,"Managing Incoming and Outgoing medical devices, handling customer complaints efficiently, monitoring revenue, turnaround time, inventory control and providing efficient service."
good,Co workers made the job and day fun. You were always busy and never a dull moment. Many of the managers were hard to find when help was needed but there was always someone around to help out. Helping those that cannot afford their supplies was what made the day worth being there.
good,A global company undergoing major changes.  The company has many very nice people and was generally a nice place to work.
good,The best part of my job is knowing that my products positively impact the lives of the patients and their family members that I get to work with.

good,"Senior management support  is good"
good,Enjoyed working there but management was not interested in promoting people from within.
good,"First i would go to work and meet up with 1st shift at 2:00 PM and find out the status days production, deal with issues and 1 st shift complaints or any complications then at 2:15 my second shift comes in and then we would both have a huge meeting in which consist of 30 associates and discuss product flow, training and quality and safety. Then frist shift would clock out and go home and i would get the shop organized for the first 2 hours then have a meeting with my other bosses and deal with questions about the documentation practices and any thing else that pertains the job. Once the bosses are done with me they go home and now i have to make sure that the shop runs smooth. My job is to service ventilators and make sure that we get our quota out on a timely matter. I have learned patients and i have learned to work with many different cultures. The hardest part of the job is we get low on parts when we cannot make our production # so the # goes up even higher and now i have to pressure my team to make the higher #. The most enjoyable part of the job is the final result when a project is completed on time"

good,"A typical day at work consists of checking emails, daily meetings, conference calls, and finishing tasks for my manager. Over the last year and a half, I learned a lot about interacting with others, the importance of finishing work on time, and carrying myself in a more professional manner. I very much enjoy working with the people in my department. The hardest part of my job is requesting confidentiality agreements and having suppliers agree on all the terms. Going back and forth from legal is very frustrating. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I work in the medical industry and that in some way or another I am making a difference."
good,Teamwork
good,Interesting work but often overbearing by some members of management.
good,"At BD, I was a technical services representative. A typical day would be spent answering phone calls and emails (requests for information, troubleshooting, filing complaints and closing complaints).

good,"* Manage Inventory levels, guide all aspects of supply chain."
good,I usually worked 8.5-9 hours a day. I learned how important it is to keep track of everything by recording data throughout the day. The hardest part of the job was being seated for most of the day. I met so many wonderful people in the two years I worked here and am very grateful for that.

good,"We the security team deal with the workers, and the public as well. We are the go between for the employees and upper management.  We are also the first ones that they call when things go wrong.  We are expected to know and do everything.

good,"Au regret de ne pas avoir été retenu en cdi lors des test."
good,"The wages were great but the hours were very, very long and management did not appreciate the need for time off and the need for family time.  Management stated that Safety, Quality and Production were the order of priority, but that wasn't the case.  Mandatory overtime was the normal because production was always on the line."
good,"I love my Job, its a good place to work. My husband is from Washington North Carolina.CR Bard is a very productive place to work.We love thr paid holidays."
good,"Invests in employees to further their skills and provides benefits to the company.  The culture is a bit political and rather serious compared to a cutting edge company like Intuit or Facebook.  Overall, the company does do its best to make employees happy."
good,"*   Enjoy working there and meeting new peers along the way during my employment period."
good,"Worked 70 hours a week for four years. Management put no effort in to get help. We were constantly short handed. Great pay and benefits, but ultimately management just didn't care."
good,"1. Knowledgeable  and Multi-talented people around the organization. "
good,"A typical day was a tight schedule. I learned to be self reliant from the laissez-faire management style. The workplace culture was welcoming.  The hardest part of the job was the commute. The most enjoyable part of the job was the sense of accomplishment from getting to use the knowledge I acquired in university,"
good,"CareFusion was a great place to work. Got caught up in the rift of lay-offs, which happen anytime there is an acquisition. In the medical device field, it seems to happen quite frequently."
good,Typical work experience for a FDA-regulated position. This is a big company so there is a lot of big company issues. You tend to disappear in a sea of workers. Lots of outsourcing.
good,Quick paced workflow. Easy to learn and keeps you busy. Generally decent co workers. Many managers unfit for their position. Can quickly be pushed out if certain employees don't like you.
good,"Good opportunity to be challenged as an Engineer and Manager working with newest and older equipment."

good,Una empresa con un alto nivel de estres debido a los cambios que se sucitan en estos momentos. Sin embargo los cambios son buenos y la empresa empieza a repuntar. El ambiente se empieza a relajar y si te gusta la profesion Bard es un lugar donde aplicaras todos los conocimientos y experiencia adquirida. Si no la tienes aprenderas mucho de ahi.
good,BD was a great place to work.  The culture and employee benefits are wonderful.  Senior management is really good with communication to all employees.
good,Life is full of numbers and by working in accounting I have learned to see the number everywhere.  Good thing I love numbers and I would not know what to do without them.  Give me a puzzle and let me solve it.  I am really good at researching an issue back to the beginning and resolving the problem.

good,"Opportunities were provided to learn various areas of the business.  Gained great experience as a Process Technologist to develop knowledge of manufacturing, filling line equipment and Aseptic processing. As Quality Engineer, I have increased my knowledge of regulatory requirements and developed competency with risk assessment, non-conformance investigations, complaint handling, audit responses for customers and regulatory agencies, and change management. As Label Control Supervisor, I have restructured the department to accommodate expanded product offerings by adding headcount and labeling equipment."
good,Le travail est très varié et se déroule dans une bonne ambiance.
good,Although the pay and compensation were on par with the industry things were a little disorganized. Management seemed to only manage upward being in constant fear of losing their jobs as much as everyone else. Many people were let go due to downsizing in preparation for a huge merger that just completed this month.

good,"For the most part, I enjoy working at Carefusion.  I have had the opportunity to learn and grow while working there."

good,"Excellent opportunity for advancement and full- time employment with company. Detailed but not rigorous physical work. Days consist of unloading trailers and locating product. For those living in, or close to the Metropolitan area it can be a bit of a commute."
good,"I can't say CFN was a bad company, just not the right fit for me."
good,"Beckton Dickerson is a wonderful place to work.Management there are always willing to help you in any situation,especially in career advancement."
good,"Empresa muito boa de se trabalhar, porém a respeito de promoções era muito difícil de se conseguir."
good,"1. A 3-2-2-3 work schedule from 8pm to 8am. 2. I lean mostly technical information and technique setup, troubleshooting, changeover and repairs. 3.Management was good sometime a little differcult. 4. A great group of people to work with. 5. Finding new ways of having a better quality production run. 6. The same as number 5"
good,"over good company, too bad I was a contract worker. Very professional work place but not overly stressing."
good,"Het is een hele leuke job en een hele goeie verdienste met de nacht ploeg , alleen de werksfeer tussen collega's kan beter ."
good,Productive and fun work environment and good people. Good company culture and positive future outlook. Management can often change their strategy and people become expendable.
good,BD is overall a good company to work for. Especially the plant in South Carolina. Great people that care about what they do. The company has gone thru a lot of changes lately and it has created a lot of stress and uncertainty. Not much communication on what the final result is supposed to look like for the whole corporation. But they treat the employees good. I've had a lot of opportunities and learned a lot. If you want to make a difference you can. I hope I retire from BD.
good,"Company is currently restructuring their IT organization to support a Global SAP Implementation. While both of these events are meant to create more efficiency in the company as a whole, there have been many delays that have caused this project to drag on well past (years) its original projected go live date. Associates are forced to work long hours and weekends. While this could be sustained for short periods of time, the current timeline projects this work model for at least the next 12 months. Burn out is becoming an epidemic."
good,"A good place to learn about best practices. Lots of product lines and manufacturing challenges. Company leans forward to develop new diagnostic technologies and product lines. Good opportunities to work within design, production, and suppliers to deliver good products. Company readily invests in improvements and has enjoyed growth."
good,I was able to learn a lot and apply my skills on a daily basis. The company has a lot of interesting products and there are many ways to make an impact. However there was not much opportunity for advancement from a contracted position.
good,"BD is good and recognized health company. They are always thinking customer experience. Getting connected and networking is an open window here at this company. The negative side is that many times it feels like the company thinks a lot about external customers than internal employees. As an employee, I feel that there is a lack of interest in regards employee satisfaction overall."
good,"BD can be a bit too corporate at times, but they do a pretty good job at keeping the culture fun. I enjoyed coming to work on most days. Also, they have good engineering processes in place."
good,Keeping the line full of product that goes out on a regular. Keeping product put away in the location it should be. Loading out all product that have a to go tag. Last not least keeping my area clean and neat.
good,BD is a very stressful place to work with all the FDA regulations and paperwork that has to be done. It takes a lot of concentration to work in this very fast paced environment.
good,"Very employee friendly culture"
good,Fast paced environment focused on the customer.  On-going changes due to acquisitions.  Many large project implementations every year.  Work closely with Canadian and US Associates.
good,"BD was my first job experience after University and I've worked there too many years ago, so I don't feel comfortable rating the company at this stage of my career."
good,"I love working at BD. It is a great company. People and the workplace culture are nice. I work at the clean room performing inspections, testing, reviewing documentation, and engineering support."
good,"There are so many different products at BD that you could always be working on something new. The 2 recent acquisitions, CareFusion and Bard have only grown the portfolio. This is a complex matrixed organization where a lot of your ability to get things done comes from who you know."
good,"Demanding roles, tasked with developing and improving R&D product design. Tight schedules and availing of Agile project planning strategy.   Not enough resources to manage workload. Systems improvements and IT infrastructure requirements need to be developed further. Quality and Documentation generation always demand effort."
good,"you are required to be punctual, hard working and willing to work anywhere within manufacturing, not much chance of moving up the ladder,"
good,"Solid management."
good,Like the schedule .   Decent pay.   Lots of turnover.   12 hour rotation schedule.   Large factory. Good benfits.  Management sucks.    Overall ok job.   40 hours a week
good,"Cognizant working culture :"
good,Work at BD is very fast paced. The work force is very lean and most people end up doing 2-3 different jobs. It is very hard to stay ahead here. It is overall a good place to work.
good,"As it has been a couple years since I worked for CareFusion and CareFusion has merged with another company, I cannot provide a review of this company that would be relevant to anyone currently looking to work for them."
good,"The benefits good, the company ok, understaffed in some departments. High paced. I really didn't want to write a review------,,-,-------,-----------------'zzzxxxxx"
good,Carefusion was a very results driven company.  The culture changed dramatically over the years and not always for the better from an employee perspective.
good,"Mangers are great, never micromanage. Older crowd not open to change. Coworkers do not encourage teamwork. Overall the company has a great mission statement but most employees are only there for the paycheck."
good,"busy work environment, great benefits and  friendly co workers."
good,"Thanks to the quality of the products, the professional environnement, the well structured cross functional collaboration it was possible for me to develop successful strategic collaboration with OEM worldwide."
good,The company as a whole seems like a good company but my experience was not the best. My manager was unorganized which lead to a lot of unneeded stress.
good,"Empresa dinámica, nuevas adquisiciones, lanzamientos de productos."
good,"Through my many years with BD, my career develop well beyond my expectations.  The only reason that I am no longer employed at BD is due to their decision to off-shore all technical resources"
good,"Time management and people management are important.  While multi-tasking isn't the best way to work, it is required here.  There is a culture of do it right, do it well, but do it FAST!"
good,This was a commission based sales position.  We all worked very hard to make our numbers and earn a good living.  The products are the best in the market.  I am proud to say that I worked for them.
good,I work from 7 to 4 each day with overtime as required.  I am in the Quality Department and help monitor and submit FDA reports.  Company culture is community oriented.
good,Very good training and experience working with fun dedicated workers and managers in this medical products environment. Very rewarding daily tasks with high sense of a job well done.
good,I was a part of Carefusion right when the organization was formed and it was an exciting place to be.  The leaders have since changed and the business I was a part has been divested so unable to share current information.
good,"no comment about the current state of this company."
good,great place to work. great culture.  management could be better.  Benefits are good but medical insurance could be better. Sometimes the job can be stressfull.
good,"Boa empresa pra se trabalhar, entretanto alguns gestores recisam ser melhor preparados para os desafios do mercado"
good,BD challenges its employees to perform. In general one of BD's greatest strength is its employees and its value system that guides professionalism and work life balance. A good place to work.
good,This job is flexible and understanding in reference to work/life balance. Fixed Asset Management has been unsteady for the past two years. Advancement is seldom in General Accounting. Inclusion and Diversity is becoming a focus at this work environment. Hardest part of the job is being recognized for accomplishments. Most enjoyable part of this job are the friendships that are created.
good,"Saving lives everyday with disposable medical devices. Challenging work environment, fast paced, many ongoing projects and initiatives. Manufacturing sites need more linkage/visibility to corporate strategy."
good,It is very interesting to work in a medical factory.  A long term stable job.  I wish more of my jobs were like this.  The kind of place you envisioned working as a child.
good,"A lot of work to do, not afraid to give overtime to employees. Very strict on quota. Good incentives and treats employees fair. Fast paste environment."
good,This company is good to a certain level. The problem with it was the abillity to advance in pay rate or promotions. I did like the final department I was in. I do not have any poor things to say other than those few that I have given. The company did pay well and when you where able to be promoted you where taken care of.
good,a typical day would be processing units in a fast paced but orderly manner. we are always on our feet lifting 30 to 45 lb. materials continuously all day.
good,"From what I hear, they have flex schedules so that's a plus, as far as anything else I'm not aware, haven't been there in 22 years. I do know people that are still there so it can't be that bad"
good,"Laid off 100+ people two weeks before Christmas."
good,"BD is a great company to work for. "
good,Enjoyed this job while it lasted. Work was fast paced with good coworkers. The was a large break room and good breaks. I had very few to no problems while employed here.
good,"They mainly have temp positions so job security is good for the time of your contract. After that, who knows. Pay is average, overtime is common. They have events for the staff which is nice, temps don't get any benefits other than what the temp agency offers, company employees have benefits though."
good,Assurer que les produits qui sortent de l'usine soient conformes aux spécifications clients.

good,"Vary Busy"
good,les conditions de travail sont tres agreable. les intérimaires sont tres bien concideres de plus les formations sont completes
good,Becton Dickinson is a good company to be employed with.  Their compensation package is higher compared to other companies in the New Jersey area.  Culture is a family type environment with pleasant co-workers.
good,"Overall this is a great company to work for - great benefits, competitive salary, good group of co-workers.  On the downside, unless you are technically inclined there isn't much room for advancement (in the QC office)."
good,"Active day on production area, I learned new process on medical area,  young management on process of growing, communicate new ideas on continues improvement, make excelent inter-relation with people of all levels"
good,"Fun work place with supportive colleagues and supervisors. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,Good company.  Overall this company is really treats it employees well.  Doesn't always have the best communication with their employees.
good,"Nice place to work, flexible schedule. Friendly people, always busy. Opportunity to learn different things in the different department."
good,"A typical day at work involved working with management to ensure smooth closure of site by maintaining employee engagement. Completed site initiatives that were in place such as Health Assessments and Career Assistant Workshops through Lee Hecht Harrison. Processed payroll and managed leave of absences as well as Workman's Comp claims.  Scheduled and conducted all exit interviews for site closure. Created group presentation for exiting employees to ensure a collective understanding of BD's severance package.  "
good,BD is a a great company with a lot of potential to grow due to the recent acquisition of CareFusion. The company is poised to expand its footprint in the medication management space.
good,i have learned many things in this company like how to work in a team.Management of this company is too good.managing team is very cooperative and supportive.they give the opportunity to learn the many things to the employee.
good,Good work environment with very limited opportunities for advancement.  Quality is implemented throughout the process.
good,"planning une semaine avant, il est régulier. "
good,"I learned a lot about how a medical device company works.  As a small subsidiary of C.R. Bard, we function as a startup.  This leads to employees, especially R&D personnel, to wear many ""hats"".  I've had the chance to immerse myself in product development, manufacturing, clinical, and quality control through this dynamic internship."
good,Different environment compared to Retail and not so fast paced. Enjoyed learning about a new sector. Only a temporary role to cover maternity leave.
good,"Very fast paced environment, but more than adequate training was provided.  Analytical skills along with Excel skills were an important part of the position.  Needed to be a team player, yet work independently on a daily basis."
good,"Allows to manage work load, plan and execute orders assigned."
good,Good company to start off in a phone sales enviroment.  Learning how to manage time is a major skill gained here.  Co-workers are very helpful and friendly.  Management is helpful and friendly.

good,"·Help make sure  plastic injected goods remained at max production, without loss in quality overall"
good,Grazie a BD ho potuto crescere notevolmente in ambito professionale.
good,"Started as a HR Assistant and gor ptomoted to HR Supervisor."
good,"I would go in at midnight every night and would work with a team of 3 or 4 people. We would start up the line and inspect and package the product. I learned how to do this work, plus fix the machines and switch out product when needed. My supervisors were very nice and, most of the time, were helpful. My co-workers were fun to work with but sometimes were very juvenile and inappropriate, which at various times made me uncomfortable. The hardest part of my job was when I had to work with people who loved to spread rumors or were just plain unpleasant, because I had to spend eight hours straight with them. The part of my job that I loved the most was learning new things, inside the cleanroom and out in the rest of the plant. I loved being the person that my supervisor would call on to learn something new."
good,"My Experience In BD Is Very Good, I Am Satisfied With My Job Profile & Other Aspect."
good,"un dia de trabajo inicia saludando a mis compañeros de trabajo y solicitando pendientes nuevos a mi supervisor"
good,Great facility and top notch people. Learned about working with engineers
good,festejan los dias celebres tus coañeros de trabajo son buenas personas.
good,"During all my time at CareFusion Intl. I have always felt like I was in a big group of friends - whether VP, Managers, support functions everyone was pretty much on the same level of respect which made the working environment very pleasant & friendly. Whenever I was travelling on business I found this same ""friendly"" atmosphere with colleagues from different offices worldwide. Always eager to help and sharing the same respect. "
good,Very engaging and focus oriented. The colleagues I worked with had vast experience in the medical industry and pushed me to learn more and increase my involvement
good,After 29 years I have had great life-changing experiences at BD but their processes prevent them from developing products
good,I worked with Becton Dickinson for 17 years as Antibody Purification Scientist. I had a good experience until my department closed. BD is a good company.
good,"Overall, the company has treated me well, but lacks a firm goal from the top down that leaves a large hole in the project prioritization process which leads to general frustration."
good,You make medical products but you also learn  everything about them. You spend more team with your coworkers than you own family. In away your team becomes a  second family.
good,lots of great people to work with. management was good. you could enjoy going to work I actually felt like I was contributing to the goals of the site.
good,"Worked on a service life test of medical equipment, so daily tasks were repetitive - tasks being running the equipment and documenting the results. That was a bit of a drag, but had a great team and management during my shift. Everyone looked out for each other and was friendly, which was easily the best part of the job. The other shift was a bit problematic, but some improvements were made. Working in an research and development lab gave me a better idea of what kinds of projects were going on across the company; and my shift team was encouraged to get involved with other projects in the lab. There were several other projects we got involved with while work on our part of the service life test was on pause. That allowed us to work with engineering, quality assurance, and reliability teams."
good,"BD as a company looks after there employers and pays very well but for me as an employe I don't really fell part of my team. during my time at bed I supported multiple projects to deliver design improvements, cost savings component, component obsolescence issues. My role requires me to be highly competent in electronic design, Cadence ECAD package, manufacturing processes, quality documentation and change order management processes"
good,It's a good company with good benefits and pretty good pay. Vacation is a little low when you start but that is to be expected. Jobs are pretty easy and easy to learn

good,"Management deliver in commitment, relatively slow pace, high integrity and collaboration. Meaningful purpose and focus on quality for patient care."

good,Heel aangenaam werken bij BD. Aangename collega's en de sfeer is daar super. Voor mezelf spreek ik over de afdeling labeling. Het spijtige is dat er op de afdeling labeling geen zicht is op vaste contracten.
good,"Professional place to work. "
good,"Very helpful and friendly co-workers."
good,"Company has plans to become modern and use inclusion and diversity as a tool for it. But for now it’s just a plan, that’s why I believe that it’s going to be improve lot of things in the future. There are lots of good and smart people leading this process."
good,"I’ll start this review by saying that I have worked in several manufacturing plants and this one is the best I’ve worked at.  "
good,Worked for BD when they were Liberator and over all they were a great company who showed alot of love for employees. I would go back to the company . Most of the people i worked with were great and i love helping others
good,it was a good job with stability. Enjoyed going to work. I met a lot of good people there and was a good step in the direction of my degree. Because of BD I decided to become an electrical mechanical tech.
good,"Large company with well regulated environment by FDA."
good,Its not bad here. If you are a contract worker they will really give you the shaft but if you can get hired in then you will be taken care of really good.
good,"I worked at BD as a UI developer for almost 2 years."
good,"had a competitive good pay, had good health insurance such as visiion, dental, and medical. lacked a good supervisor. needed a better system when using vacation hours."
good,Agradable ambiente laboral la empresa cuenta con valores y políticas de calidad las cuales tratan de inculcar al asociado
good,Supervisors mainly for themselves bd is a good job and only you can make yourself get fired by your actions ..it’s very demanding if you don’t have time off available then you are required to be at work however it offers  a lot of overtime which is really good
good,"Hours are tough, distance for me was wearing doing 12 hour overnight shifts. Atmosphere is relaxed, but can be stressful at times. Manufacturing department is cut throat, people will stab others in back for their own benefit. "
good,"This company is focused on hitting their numbers, and the culture supports that motive. When numbers are not met, that is where management will spent most of their time."
good,"Good place to work at, having a good time here, a bit of politics that needs to be taken of everyday, which is at every company, so it is not too bad."
good,The job was to prepare and test products for the company and meet cGMP regulations. I had weekly projects that I was responsible for. There were only a couple of different rotating projects that I was allowed to perform due to my lack of a BS degree.
good,"BD is a global leader in medical technology.  The company offers a competitive salary and the culture is dynamic.  It is a great atmosphere and smart people surround you. It offers many opportunities to learn and grow in your career.  There are however, many changes occurring within the organization.  Communication can be better but overall, a great place to work."
good,"It can be busy, but not overwhelming.  good people, nice atmosphere. Nice facility.  the company has a long history of medical device manufacturing.  I think there is a low turnover as I work with many people who have worked there for a long time."

good,"ik werkte bijna 30 jaar voor BD en behalve de laatste 6 maanden heeft dit bedrijf mij zeer veel bijgebracht."
good,"good company ,long shifts due to running 24 hours a day"
good,"Nurturing and promoting teamwork are not a primary concern of board of directors; consequently, lacking of cohesiveness and collaboration is discernible among numerous engineering departments thus affects company overall success."
good,"Great opportunity as well as benefits. Manager was very organized, but understanding. Staff was friendly and made the day go by fast. Job was hard, but rewarding."
good,I was a temp to hire position even though they didn't hire me I felt like if they had an open position they would have.  They ended up outsourcing their general ledger and fixed assets so my position was terminated.
good,Great place to work. Leading healthcare company with a large number of customers in the US and in the international market. Great teams and colleagues to work with.
good,"Good work experience.  Team is very knowledgeable and proactive in providing excellent outcomes.    The company has a good vision, good products, and a focus on innovation."
good,friendly coworkers and supervisors care about you as an individual. i worked as a temp and they catered to my school schedule that i needed. it is not a bad job to have.
good,"Working on a production line building or packaging in a fast paced work environment. This was my first manufacturing job , so everything I  learned was new to me. Control documents Specifications,MSDS, OSHA,FDA regulations,GPA ant the train the trainer program was a great learning tool. The hardest part of the job was mandatory overtime , however you get used to long hour's. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing I was building quality products to help the healthcare industry improve poeple's quality of living."
good,"Great benefits, culture of respect for employees. Great place to develop your professional career. would advice to not get to complacent with the job security."
good,"Good company, good pay, good benefits, nice people.  The move away from R&D is unfortunate.  They would rather buy smaller companies than develop new products."
good,"Often contract employees work and are not given the opportunity to convert to direct/permanent employees, yet could make some of the best employees if given opportunity."
good,"I was a contractor, so I did not have a full compensation package, but my group director was fantastic and a good teacher. The other members in our group were nice and helpful. I only left because I found a permanent job with benefits at another company."

good,"The company does focus on providing solutions to Healthcare problems.  Requires very productive work from most of its employees, some more than others."
good,"The work itself is very interesting. You get to tear into a ventilator unit and replace a large circuit board that controls the pneumatic part of the unit. Then you calibrate the unit and perform an operational verification procedure to ensure everything is working per manual specifications. You get to travel to various parts of the United States and stay in very nice accommodations with a rental car all at company expense. The hardest thing was waiting for parts when there was a malfunction. It was a major loss of time. For me, the most enjoyable part of the job was working on the machine itself since I enjoy working with technology. The workplace was very professional. I am proud to be an employee of this company. Although the management encouraged communication, it did not always seem to work both ways, i.e. from manager to employee."
good,You can make money if you work in sales. And it's a sharks tank so go in ready for a sales job. I made over 45k my first year. Not the most I've made in sales big given the location I wasn't complaining.
good,Well respected company in the Medical device industry. Designs and manufactures great products. Provides room to grow in career.
good,A typical day at work consisted of being on the phones making calls to doctor's offices in an attempt to obtain a verbal auth or signed Rx to dispense medical equipment to clients. My Team Lead Dawn was a gem - I adored her! My manager Mark was the best I ever worked with because her was down-to-earth and sympathetic. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job (besides receiving that hefty incentive check once a month) was the team I was on. I loved every one of my squad co-workers!!!
good,Compensation is Excellent. Work/life balance not so much. Strong leadership. Great thought leaders. It's all about what you can produce and there's opportunities for career advancement. A lot of unsettling with BD acquisition. Changes are happening fast and there is a lot of concern. Overall the company is very strong and a great place to work.
good,"Pour un alternant, l'entreprise est intéressante du point de vue des missions proposées. Les collègues sont là pour nous mettre dans le bain du monde du travail."

good,CareFusion is an international company with facilities all over the world so I can only really comment on the facility that I worked at. The facility was a great place to work with many friendly and helpful coworkers and members of management. All of the workers in my department worked together as a team which helped to make each day an enjoyable one.
good,"good work life balance. good salary, compensation and  benefits. good potential for advancement. approachable management."

good,"If only our small company stayed longer with BD, I would say, BD is a very excellent company to work with because this company is in the healthcare business. People from all walks of life needs this company because they helped not only their emplyees but also the public because of their products they produce that people depend on"
good,"This company is fun to work for, with a casual vibe. Not a lot of bureaucracy at the lower-than-manager levels. Very communicative in the sense that you get to understand how your job/project/program supports the growth of the business."
good,"The complaint system in which they utilized was a little out date however, the people made the job worth doing. They had no problem with answering question."
good,A typical day at work was very productive.. I learned how to work independently and to be self sufficient..I enjoyed working with different ethnic groups and supportive management team.
good,"Productive and learned a lot working at Becton and Dickinson, and enjoy working with my Managers and co workers. It was a very fun work environment."
good,"It was a nice place to work.  Nice benefits, friendly coworkers.  I was unfortunately laid off after 14 years of service."
good,"At shift change (beginning of the shift), it was usually an uncomfortable feeling, there were certain co-workers that went out of their way to ignore you or make you feel less capable then them. There was no chance of advancement there, it was all based on favoritism. The supervisor liked to micro manage her staff, always disciplined you based on rumors, never gave you the benefit of the doubt. Never came to one and got their version of the story and never approached witness. When going to management, they would listen but nothing would ever be done! Same thing with HR, they never got the whole story also. I didn't learn much at carefusion, I went in with knowledge from previous work experience. I knew more than some of the employees that had been there for years. There were some employees that were enjoyable to work with that I can still call them my friends to this day. There were some engineers that where enjoyable to work with and treated you with respect and always explained everything to the workers."
good,"BDMS was a good place to work. It had family events and allowed family members to tour where ""Mom & Dad"" worked.  Pay was competitive for East Coast and health benefits were good.  Coming straight out of grad school, they paid my first month's rent and put me up in temporary housing for a month, allowing me to get on my feet.  Company had box seats at Oriole games and gave employees opportunities to go for free. I loved working there in the Baltimore-Washington DC corridor!"
good,"One of my biggest issues was the lack of life and work balance."
good,"Monde intéressant, process en perpétuelle évolution. Qualité et bon du premier coup sont des objectifs quotidiens"
good,It was a very sanitary environment and employees had to wear proper attire to cover areas of the body that could of spread unwanted germs. At first my anxiety was very high and I had to keep myself occupied to keep my mind off of it. However the attire required is important for the safety of those patients who will be put in contact with that merchandise. I learned all about how the facilities were organized and how strict the protocols were in regard to yielding so many catheter by the ended of every week. I also learned how complex every department is and how much of an abundance of merchandise is shipped every week. Managers worked hard to run every department and to be fair to the co-workers. Co-workers all had to be team players in order to make sure that group of manufacturers were on the same page. The hardest part of the job was the tedious repetition required in an eight hour shift. However I enjoyed the pay and I got to listen to music which was a plus.
good,"Each business is like working for a completely different company.  There is a lot of opportunity, if you are patient."
good,Check to see what job or duties need to be done first through the supervisor or day shift co-workers . Working with chemicals was the hardest part of the job. I loved doing various duties and working with and helping co-workers.

good,"I have the opportunity to work with great people at my current employer. I typically start my day by updating/creating contracts to send off to distributors. I spend a lot of time talking with marketing, sales, IT and finance to compile completed data and keep each unit in line. It is my responsibility to work all rebated lines that come in for my business unit. Working with IT is a huge task for me as I am continuously working with them to make our processing system more efficient. We just moved into a new facility with many great amenities including a gym, coffee bars, and cafeteria. The best part of my day is interacting with my employees and co workers."
good,"Bard is a high on education and you can have your complete college education paid for though the company. It the past few years they have work hard to help you get the training you need to complete your job."
good,Growing and as such as lots of challenges. Lots of turnover as challenges have bee too great for some to handle.
good,This was a fast paced job and had good management. the co-workers were great and the job was fairly easy.
good,"Se ofrece un aprendizaje continua debido a las numerosas capacitaciones que se otorgan al personal, el crecimiento profesional es muy lento y la remuneración económica es baja respecto a la cantidad de responsabilidades adquiridas con el tiempo."
good,"My time at Care Fusion was the most enjoyable experience I have ever had, in a position. I was the Facilities Admin Coordinator, and it was my main responsibility to coordinate repairs, and cubical moves for five different building sites. I was always busy, and it was great. Along with the work load, my favorite aspect of the job was my boss. He ensured I understood everything I needed to know, by providing all the training I needed to do my best. My co-workers, were very helpful as well, and were there to support me with any question I had that they could answer. The hardest aspect of the job was leaving it. Due to personal family related circumstances, I found my self having to relocate to another state."
good,"Besides the fact that the leadership had trouble getting started on the job we were on, it was a great work experience."
good,"Good work life balance."

good,This company is located in Columbus Nebraska and I enjoy working there really good paying and people are always helpful and good environment and management
good,There are friendly co-workers who work as a team and a wonderful manager. The pay was $10/hr which isn't bad. The only thing that wasn't great was standing 10hrs a day on concrete floors. I recommend getting good shoes.

good,La empresa te brinda un excelente ambiente laboral
good,"I was in a temporary position but I really enjoyed this job. We had long breaks, we weren’t constantly on our feet and weren’t micro managed. We also got to travel around the city to different hospitals. Also great pay"

good,Good company. good culture. growing very fast in the last 5 years with acquisition of 2 big companies resulting in triple the size of the company. People were impacted.

good,BD is making changes to become more efficient as it take on Bard and becomes one of the largest medical device companies in the industry.  The solutions the company will now provide will be second to none.  The management is making changes to deliver on their promise - they will require their people to have the skills to meet the promise.

good,"As a whole, BD is a very good company, doing good things. There is a variety of work cultures (good & not-so-good) within the organization.  Good opportunities for young, aspiring professionals."
good,"I would have continued to work at BD if not for their yearly lay offs.  I was there for almost 15 years and really enjoyed working there.  Nice people, on site gym, employee events, etc.  Management needs help!  Some managers were hired or advanced into positions they had no experience working in."
good,The company had just been purchased by BD in NY. Most of the non-production staff was losing their jobs due to duplication. Our job was to complete the tax returns for the period when CareFusion ceased to exist.

good,"Entreprise où on apprécie travailler, bonne ambiance d'équipe, Managers à l'écoute, bon CE, salaires corrects, formations prévues pour que les salariés évoluent en même temps que l'entreprise."
good,"A typical day at work is fun and enjoyable. The people are always nice to hang around and they are very kind and polite. They are good with new employees and will help each other out when they need it. The work environment is enjoyable. The machines run good and you don't have many problems running them, and the work environment is clean. They keep the place nice and clean all of the time and when you are done working you clean up around the machines if there are tubes that have fallen out of the tube bins. Management is also good. I've learned though to not argue with your fellow employees because you spend more time arguing about what to do if there is a problem, rather than fixing it. They do run things smoothly though. They are always on top of things, they make sure we are working in a safe environment and they always look out for their employees. The hardest part of my job was paperwork. The paper work is a crucial part of working in the plant and if the paperwork was wrong the whole order was wrong. If there was a mess up on the paperwork, and it had been sent off to another machine, you had to track it down to fix what you messed up on the paperwork. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the people there. My fellow employees made work fun and enjoyable and they always kept the day lively even when it seemed long. I will miss working with them the most."
good,"Upper management was not the best but had great life balance, was given a lot of good opportunities to work on good projects. Overall, environment was great."
good,"They teach you everything you need to know about how to work on a phone, basic MS Office, and a lot of useful technical Medical knowledge. There isn't much room for advancement though, Department leads, sure, but that's about it. Honestly, work there for 2-3 years, move around departments as much as you can, and use what you learn to get into Medical admin."
good,"great place to work. great people, great work culture."
good,Buen ambiente laboral y trabajo de equipo/ Muy enfocado a resultados
good,Good place to work.  Changed since BD bought the company to be more structured which is a good thing.  Salary is fair.  Advancement is difficult.  Management is good overall.
good,"Can seem pretty slow paced. Not many people moving around. It is a basic sit at your desk, do the work kind of a job. Working at your own pace. Would have been nicer if it was more of a working as a team environment."
good,Each day at work was varied which required contact with various departments and colleagues this gave the opportunity to shared work practices and knowledge on a regular basis enabling continual growth and development.  The organisation put a lot of focus on self driven development so the culture was great to support this.  My role came with a lot of time pressures and due to the variety of people involved meant consistent organisation and communication with colleagues to achieve results and meet deadlines. This however created a great sense of team work and group morale within the workplace.
good,"Normalmente regalan pan dulce los viernes por la mañana para tomar con el café."

good,Our management was great to work for but on the corporate level I think they had no clue to what they were doing when they shut the facility down.
good,"Great place to work. Managers have open door policy. Can be stressful at times. Good teamwork. Great co-workers. Benefits are great, good vacation time, sick time and good insurance."
good,"Everyday can be straining and hard on your back. "
good,"With all the Mergers; Buy-outs, it made my days sometimes very uneasy - not knowing when the shoe was going to fall by being laid-off, and in November 2015 - that's exactly what happened to me."
good,"Work load is high but you have access to great number of latest technology.  You can advance your career when you have access to many technologies.  Since this is a global company, you will end up working off hours to meet deadlines.  The communication between management and workers need to improve .  We always hear changes from word of mouth.  By the time they announce, the news is already old.  The people are nice to work for.  Hardest was to meet deadlines when the company was down sizing"
good,"En general es muy buena empresa para trabajar, aprendi técnicas profesionales de ventas y como administrar mi tiempo de manera productiva, en mi opinion la dirección de la division es excelente, los nuevos gerentes son buenos, lo que mas me gusto del trabajo fue el conocer gente tan profesional y dedicada como mis compañeros"

good,"Enjoyed my time here.  Wish they were more innovative and less bureaucratic but this is typical of a company this size.  I enjoyed the cross functional cooperation.  Working in silos is not good, but sometimes there were so many extraneous people involved in driving important projects that it negatively impacted productivity.   Company is well intended overall."
good,"Great benefits"

The company was always seeking ways to imporve efficiencies by seeking employee participation in that process. We worked 12 hr. shifts and enjoyed our time on shift with lots of pot luck dinners. The hardest part probably was communicating over long distances in a noisy invironment. "

After you take care of your primary responsibilities, you are given free reign to prioritize secondary work and complete them in a comfortable manner. Managers typically operate with a hands-off approach that give people room to breathe and do their work. The atmopshere is friendly and the company hosts events that allow you to participate and engage as little or as much as you please with other co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the extremely flexible work hours.

good,I used to be a picker at Bard. The money & insurance is good but everything else sux. The people work against each other trying to make the production you are pressured to make. The over time is off the chain. That's ok if you like that but I have a life. A typical day at work is spent fighting each other for work to get your numbers. What I learned was how to look out for myself because no one else will. Management would rather stick their head in the sand like an ostrich rather than hear all the problems that need to be addressed. All I have to say is good luck to all the good people left over there that still have to deal with it.

good,"Amazing company, organization and facility.   Relentless used of SPC, DOE and DMAIC to archive best in class quality.  It was an extremely clean facility and very well managed and organized.   Validation of Equipment, Processes and Product to optimized operating process parameters is a daily event and on everybody's daily activities.  First facility  I work on where the quality culture is a living culture.  I felt like we were audited by a third party every month.

good,"Working for BD was an eye opening experience. I was lucky to work for a large, well known company which made products with excellence and ethics. Distanced from any factory work, I was nonetheless able to play a key part in operations and felt that my role was never put down for being an office job. Day to day hours in the office were pretty mundane, buckle down and do the work but there was always time for a joke at daily team meetings, and our group lead believed heartily in taking time to celebrate each win. Potlucks to make not of software launches, holidays, and sometimes seasonal changes were the norm, and office decorations were encouraged as long as they didn't go overboard."

good,"Overall, Carefusion (Pyxis) was a great company to work for.  As the company began to transform into a larger entity, the management began to shift.  Our territories where broken down into teams.  The individuals that where in my team worked very hard at their projects and were willing to assist each other.  The most difficult part of the job was the long hours and the paperwork.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when a project was completed and successful.  Our national meetings were also fun."
good,"The daily work at BD is balanced and well controlled by roles assigned to your daily activities in SAP."
good,A typical day of work went quick and easy. You were allowed to listen to your own music or books on audio. You work independently and management was amazing. You had a review sheet each week that showed progress. Raises were awesome and the people there were all so friendly and helpful. I loved this job. Job Security was bad because they were going through a huge lay off. I got hit with it and by the time they called me back I had received a better job

I learned that heavy industry jobs are very fast paced and require a lot of time to getting used to. The management was decent but not very supportive i constantly had issues with a manager telling me maybe the job was not for me but i ignored them and kept moving forward with my job. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with everyone else who were already advanced in the work area and improve all at the same time.

Management was ok, but sometimes set unrealistic expectations on project deadlines."

Each assignment was a little different as I sometimes focused on upgrading software or I removed the components of the system for analysis.

Always had great benefits and continued to have wonderful leadership within my department.  The employees etc were overall wonderful people to work with.  Customer Service can be somewhat demanding and stressful, as we dealt with customers on the phone from all over the country...not just the US.

Every job there is full-time, I was asked if I wanted overtime over the weekend almost every week. It was mostly voluntarily overtime, but when people didn't sign up or the teams numbers were down it would be forced overtime, which is okay when you see your paycheck. The pay there is very decent. Unfortuntly, the only way of getting into Bard is through a temporary staffing agency, so EVERYONE starts off as a temp. now. The contract with the agency is three months, so after the three months they will look into how you performers and possibly be permanent. You are not isolated in your work, it is a open environment with many employees which are nice, so you can talk all day to them and will not get yelled at by management. Most of the managers there were good, some were strict because they are forced to be strict because they have to keep up with the numbers, if not, goodbye manager. If you do get the job be very carefull, as a temp they will let you go for anything! be there on time everyday and just do what your told, do anything out of there policy and you will be fired, we have all seen it happen. You do not get any warnings. Unless you are late they have a three strike policy for that. It is a job to look forward to!! You can apply through Intregrated Stafffing in Glens Falls, NY."

Great pay and company incentives. Company incentives would change over the years. Sometimes you could earn quarterly bonuses. Over time was offered all the time, sometimes it was over bearing. Was nice when it was not mandatory so if you did not want or needed it you could offer it to another team member. Great co-workers but like any manufacturing clean room environment you always get some employee's who can not get along. 8 hour positions turned into 12 hour positions to do high company demands which did become exhausting to take care of your family. One department stayed 8 hours throughout the entire company but for job security many of us ran to the 12 hour positions where your position was more secure. I got bumped many times do to my seniority within the company. Sometimes there was no heads up and you would start your new shift with 2 days which was very tough for certain employee's of course raising a family. I worked days, afternoons and graveyard shift."
