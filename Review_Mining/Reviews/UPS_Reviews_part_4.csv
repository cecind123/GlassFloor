They need to be to certain specifications, but when done right there you have a happy customer. I enjoy the customer interactions the most"
good,"It was great to work for UPS I learned a lot from the job. I worked in the call center and I assisted customers, businesses and more with tracking and locating packages. There were a lot of different screens to be used some my navigation skills are sharp. The hardest part to me was the multi-screens because it was 6 different screens that all do something."

good,"The nights were a little hard to get used to, but  the work made the shifts go by quicker.Working at UPS was the start to a career in shpping. If I could have gotten a transfer out to the Deerfield,Ma or Springfield,Ma I would've still been with them but there weren't any openings and I didn't have the seniority.While I was at UPS,though, it was the greatest job I ever had."
good,"A typical day as a drivers helper starts by meeting the driver on route. We get the equipment necessary for deliver and then sign in. We then start to organize the boxes for delivery, log them into the database then we deliver them to the appropriate address. I learned the importance of team work and dedication. At UPS you can't think only about yourself but instead the people around you. The management and co-workers are both helpful and energetic.

good,I audit and create International shipments.  I load and unload freight.  I enjoy it because I have the ability to work independently.

good,The early morning job is consistent but hard working. We are told how much we have for the day including what is expected of of us for the day. My co-workers at UPS are funny and make the day go quicker than you think that you are there. But the hardest part of working here is that you have to have a swift mind and a very fast body. I would have to say that the best past of the day is the morning before you start. When you worded the morning before and you get to hear the statistics of what happened the other morning and you hear your supervisor say that you had no miss loads. For some reason that puts a big smile on my face.
good,"Walking back and forward out of trucks"

Since I have past experience in mangement, I find our managers are good at their jobs, and they get the volume of freiight in the terminal or on the way to it set out to be unloaded in a timely manner.I have decent coworkers, we all try to help one another since some of the motorfreight is very heavy and it takes more than one to get it on a pallet. The hardest part is some of the very heavy motorfreight. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting or exceeding the production numbers set out by the terminal."
good,"Constantly moving all day long, meeting new people, consistency"
good,The team at UPS is very friendly and helpful.  I have worked there for the past few holiday seasons and I have learned a lot about customer service in just that little bit of time.
good,"A typical day at UPS is like working in a factory. It is very direct and the supervisors are  somewhat strict but for very important reasons. They don't want their workers to be in danger. The hardest part of the job is getting accustomed to the physical labor. For instance, if you are not one to work out before working there you will get a rude awakening. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking amongs peers because they  can totally relate to one another. If you can not make friends then working at United Parcel Services will be extremely rigorous on you."
good,Very demanding job. Must be able to multi-task and stay focused on the end results.
good,"Great place to work.I dont know what else to tell you."
good,"I worked there while attending a community college and it really helped me pay for this. In a job market where it is difficult to find work that will give you benefits as well as a flexible shift, this was a perfect job for me. I had to not only balance my school with work but I was also a member of the baseball team and that took up a lot of my time as well. UPS was always willing to work with me and figure out a plan and that is something that is hard to find these days."
good,"it was a great job , lots of good perks , fun customers , lots of little task to do but you can manage, might get overwhelming at times"

I learned about the various shortcuts to reach an address faster, an excellent memory needed to remember all delivery locations and good organizing skills makes the job easier. The team were all very helpful to assist wherever needed to complete a day's route. Management was very informative to provide a thorough walk-through of each driver assistant's role. The hardest part would be remembering the many delivery zip codes. The most enjoyable part would be delivering packages to customers; it felt like delivering holiday presents."

Management made sure that all aspects of the job were explained in great detail and made it a good experience. The hardest part of the job was getting in/out of the truck all day, but it also deemed to be great exercise.

good,"Everyday at work was great because i had a great driver that help me out a lot. I learned how to deliver packages at a fast pace and keep up with the time and get a long with everyone in the area all of my customers and workers. The management was also great they weren't just telling us how to do anything they very helpful in every and anything just like all my coworkers. The hardest part of the day was keeping up with the time because you will have over 400-500 packages in your truck and we had to deliver each one of them everyday at a certain time.The most enjoyable time at this job was meeting good people such as the good people i delivered to everyday, and my coworkers were great."

Our center manager is very kind  and hard working and believes in family, My co-workers are great and I love speaking to them daily even if it just a quick hello. I enjoy my job as it is great to know we are providing a wonderful service and making so many people happy ."
good,"Good management.  Owners (because it is a franchise) are pretty great.  Learned a lot from the POS systems.  Got to experience new model of a reconditioned store.  Hardest part of the job would be having to deal with unhappy customers -- that no matter how hard you tried to make things better, some customers just aren't happy.  The most rewarding part of the job was seeing our repeat clients....  they were usually so happy and chipper when they walked in and saw familiar faces behind the counter, whether it was to send off a package or to check their mail box."
good,"My employment with UPS was very satisfactory. I loaded trailer trucks with parcels set to be delivered out of state. I had to remember shipment codes in order to assure delivery to the proper state. The management was more than exceptional, they commonly help employee appreciation days. My coworkers were fun and with a strong work ethic. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a speedy load time and remembering the coding. I really enjoyed the camaraderie amongst the employees."
good,"Working as a driver assistant was both fun and rewarding. Seeing people smile when they get the package that they've been waiting for is very rewarding. The drivers are hard working individuals who do their best to show you the ropes and make you feel like a team player. You never think for one second that when you're working there that what you're doing is pointless. While it's a very fast paced environment, I know it had to be that way to get the job done. "
good,"Great Job , Everyone So Nice , Have to have great customer service skills keep a smile on my face , Trainers Were Wonderful helped me a lot with delivering heavy packages , working on computers . "
good,Awesome job to have to make extra cash. The work is hard but 4 hour shifts makes the work easy.
good,"UPS is a decent place to work. You have decent benefits such as health care, and receive raises every year. The difficult part of the work is continuing to work at the pace that they want and following every safety guideline in place. You have to sacrifice production speed to stay safe. Most of the co-workers and management are easy to get along with and work together. "
good,"Would start by getting our parcels organized, then we would get on the road and start delivering them. And we would keep delivering them until the job was done. I learned people skills, as I had to talk to people that had packages. The job was pretty simple, you just deliver the packages."
good,"Package after package, was just I mostly saw everyday of my job. But all those packages had a story to tell. A muffler going onto a restored car, a gift to a child, or an important document that need to be signed. Behind each of these stories was all about servicing our customers. I learned so much from this company that I would not have learned any where else. I gain skills that I am proud to say that UPS gave me in returned of my employment. A manager can make a big difference on how far you want to go in your career. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, because we were a ups family, the upsers.  "

good,"Physical job which is very demanding. I have leaned every aspect involving loading packages from trucks to airplanes. I have used various types of equipment from my bare hands,forklifts,tugs,small engines,and k-loaders to load the trucks and airplanes. Management is military structured as well as my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is the summer time when the temp is well over 100 degrees in a truck I am loading. the most enjoyable part is the teamwork with my friends and loading the planes. It keeps me in shape with the younger generation which I enjoy."
good,"UPS of the 1980's was in my opinion one of the best run companies in the country. Zen management, utterly committed employees, incredible work ethic that permeated everything and everyone. Labor environment (Teamster closed shop) that was respectful, collegial and always reasonable. Industry leader in compensation and opportunity for advancement was offered to almost everyone - certainly everyone that sought it."
good,"  I actually worked for America's Skilled Personnel, though during the entirety of my employment with them I worked at a UPS-Mail Innovations facility in quality control for UPS. The compensation actually was quite good. I really only left because I could never get health insurance. In retrospect I should have stayed, but I've heard from people that have worked there recently the compensation has gone down drastically."
good,I enjoy learning new things on a daily basis. Every day there is a new task and a new experience.
good,I really enjoy working at UPS. The benfits were great and the mangement was great. I just did not have enought hours.

The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my regular customers, who were very friendly."

good,"UPS is a wonderful company for ensuring employee benefits and pay. However, I have had a college degree before the time I started with UPS and it is still a bewilderment on how to advance in the company unless one wants to become a driver or a supervisor/manager. I wish UPS would make more career opportunities available for individuals who want to excel in the company but, at the same time, do not feel completely comfortorable supervising others."

good,The bad would be that some of your managers try to talk down to you. Also I have seen employees throw and play with the customers frieght. But overall it's a great company to work for.
good,Working at UPS was a very different difficult job for me just because I am a very slim gentleman packages were pretty heavy but nothing I couldn't handle waking up in the morning with pretty hard it was cold riding my bicycle to work other than that loading up three trucks wasn't a problem and loading trucks and taking them back to customers houses by dropping off packages with my driver was the fun thing about the job
good,I did 800lb Ida 6000 package is a day walk up and down stairs the belt that Miss orbs black and red and white I did everything in the book job I left the job and went back to school
good,"Me encantaba trabajar en ups , lo único que dos o tres personas indecente personas que pensaban o piensan que la empresa es de ellos y en la realidad la empresa pertenece a las personas en general es decir a quienes solicitan el servicio no a quienes por alguna razón quieren subírsele a los empleados , pero independientemente es muy buena , me encantaba trabajar en Ups ."
good,"Équipe et relation exemplaire "
good,"you'll see that it’s about the opportunity, teamwork, a supportive culture, and benefits that help you become everything you’re envisioning right now."
good,Great company and pay. Can be stressful but worth it. Never fun working out in the cold but it comes with the job. Anybody would be lucky to work with this company.
good,Good job to get for part time work. The people are nice and the pay is good.  They don’t give enough hours to work thu.  You will probably need a second job.
good,Ups is cool. Managers are great. People mind their business. Great friends made. Good benefits. Good salary. You can change jobs if you are qualified. Supervisors can train on job. Safety first.
good,"Ups is a great job for people with no kids are older kids work schedules is flexible, and pay is great weekly pay great team work great Supervisor trainer"
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed my time with UPS , I was a seasonal driver yet pay was significantly higher than any other job I've had thus far and it was my understanding that the full time employees compensation rates were extremely high as well, but this comes with a trade off, ups has high standards and expects excellence at all times, no exceptions, in this job literal seconds matter and they as well teach you to better yourself and your routine to achieve their expectations, and the pay and benefits set the pace for such. one thing I will say is this job is not for the lazy person. But they invest in your success, all in all I loved this job!!"
good,They pay very well and are flexible with hours and days. Newer vehicles and great training provided. Very knowledgeable and patient trainers. Nice and friendly co workers and a very overall friendly atmosphere.
good,It was a great experience being a helper. It's a great job for someone who hasn't worked in a while or with no experience. Very fast paced job. Mostly hard labor. Driver's are very helpful and patient. Always an opportunity for overtime.
good,"I worked hard here and I loved it. The only thing is that the weather, if it’s hot it’s hot if it’s cold it’s freezing. Other than that I loved UPS and being an unloader. I thank this company for giving me great opportunity."
good,"I really enjoyed working as seasonal driver-helper. I enjoyed the experience, meeting people, and the all around job. UPS is a wonderful company to work for. I appreciated them giving me that chance.  THANK YOU..."
good,I truly love working for this company. I have been here for 3 years and I enjoy everyday here. This company is great as are the benefits and the culture.
good,UPS has been a great place for me to start gaining work experience. The environment is very inviting and simple. Management is very caring of their workers as well as the work being produced by workers.
good,"I loved working with UPS, it’s an interactive and incorporative job with opportunity to expand and grow, if the chance to work there is in the air, take it. Fantastic benefits and the employees are apart of a union"
good,This is a great company to advance from.from seasonal positions to warehouse workers to deliver packages this is a fast environment to challenge the youth to break threw barriers and be successful.
good,"I thought the job was very straight and to the point as far as its purpose. Duties were expressed very clearly, the work hours were fair and as far as the physical demands of the job I personally felt accomplished with each shift I completed. Wouldn’t mind working as a PVD(Personal Vehicle Driver) again in the the future."
good,"We respect each other, the managers and the supervisors are very good, I'm going on my 13th year it's been great to me and my family so far I'm hoping to start a full time in here."
good,"Was hired on as a Season Driver helper, they had Friendly people who helped me when I had questions. Easy and straightforward job duties. Love to work there again"
good,No problems at all great security great people just an overall great working environment. The training was long but it was a very detailed training process
good,It was a great job and I would love to do it again the team atmosphere was great and they really understand that family is what matters nd weekly pay is awesome
good,I enjoyed meeting new people and learning a new part of My County.My managers were Awesome and Always available when needed.The only downside is that Peak season ended earlier than projected and my vehicle now needs major repairs due to the areas I delivered in.(Extremely Rural)(95%dirt/sand roads).
good,"Friendly people, pay just wasn’t enough, always busy, fun environment, I liked that you could listen to music and that you could work at your own pace"
good,I enjoyed working there people easy to talk to. Friendly environment. Got to see different areas new places good customers.  If given the opportunity I would stay longer
good,"Friendly work environment. "
good,Hiring process is quick. Managers and supervisors in contact for support.  Local work and other employees very friendly.  Used my own vehicle and delivered packages to private homes on a set route
good,"Although must start part time it is a great opportunity. Great pay and benefits, friendly work  environment. May take awhile to progress but that is because is based on seniority and sign up lists."
good,"UPS provides a work place that rewards hard work and recognizes and rewards outstanding work.  One of the best parts about the whole job is  the benefits package.  For my money, the UPS benefits package for a Part-Time employee far exceeds any company out there.  Can you name a company that 1) pays 100% of your medical insurance for both you and your family after 1 year on the job, 2) Has a 6% matching 401 K plan (You can choose either Traditional or Roth) that begins after your 1st year of employment 3) Will reimburse for additional college schooling if you maintain a passing grade and 4) provides a pension plan.  (The Pension plan will be phased out in 2023 but is grandfathered for all existing employees.) for PART-TIME EMPLOYEES?   "
good,"Great place to work. Positive experiance. People are polite,respectful,helpful.Adiquate training. Organized for most part.i would recommend this company. My position was a pvd. I wish it wasnt seasonal. I loved the job."
good,If you like to work out then look no further this is the place for that all day you may think you fast butt wait tell you start working there you can't make it to full time
good,The work place goes off the temperature outside. Summer time it gets HOT. Make sure you keep water with you. Eat healthy so you can perform. Winter time make sure you wrap up.
good,UPS is a stable company to work for with great benefits available to all employees. The pay isn't that great starting out but annual raises are given.
good,I learned how to finish work more effectively. The environment was great because there was always people who worked hard but worked as a team to get jobs done.
good,"Typically driver helper position is one of the easiest position there. Light walking, loading of packages, unloading of packages, unpaid break, great benefits if applying for driver position, helper position has it's benefits as well, overall great company."
good,I love UPS! Still hoping to get on as a driver. I will continue to apply through out & do PVD next christmas\peak season if I'm not already an employee full-time.
good,"You can’t beat the benefits here! Your getting better benefits as a part timer than you would bring full time at any other job. This job is great if you love a fast paced, hard working environment, but the harder you work they will take advantage of you!"
good,I worked seasonal for them the past two winter seasons and enjoyed it! Very good company to work for! Seasonal does not give benefits obviously. Alright pay but it’s a nice job for extra money during the holiday season
good,Hard to get into seniority base system after you train and serve as driver you have to start inside as loader then put your self on list to move up. But loved the time I spent working for ups .
good,The first couple of weeks they train you with safety rules and regulations. Ups really is a safety first job and they do a really good job at enforcing this to all employees when you first walk in and get interviewed. I'd say the bad about this job is that the work can get pretty heavy if youre loading and especially heavy when unloading. Some days they had me working different areas.
good,"The workload was very fast pace, sometimes I felt safety was not consider in the department I worked for. I felt unsafe in my sector, at times I felt that the managers just wanted to meet the quote that day. I the short time I was working at UPS, I personally saw three accidents happen near my area. I felt I was going to be injured."
good,Great company with a solid pay rate and family like work environment. They have great opportunities and room to grow with. I did not enjoy the hours they gave unless working more permanently and full time but overall they take care of their own. The most difficult part of the job was the long hours and getting in and out of the vehicle. Overall great company and wonderful opportunities.
good,"Time Management Skills, Team work, Planning and Organising, Accuracy, Timelines, Consistency, Positive Attitude, Interpersonal Skills"
good,Great company psychical work but great reward if kept terrific pay and benefits early morning job so be able to rise early management was stern as should be
good,I really enjoyed my employment as a seasonal worker for UPS my co-workers were amazing to work with as well as my supervisors. Even though we had high volumes due to Pete season of the holidays everybody worked very well together and was very supportive of each other and succeeding to complete the task that we had to do that day
good,Great holiday job got to learn alot all around and the task is f u n and challenging I didn't have any problems with my driver training me he was hella kool
good,Ups is a great company to work for everyone that works there are really nice and great people.I loved every driver I had at ups and every supervisor at ups is just a great company .
good,It's a good job but I need a full time position. I would definitely recommend someone to work there. You will deviling me a lot of nice people I really feel sad about leaving.
good,"Strong corporate leadership conveys a culture of discipline that betters the workplace. Focus on safety is important to the managers. It’s hard work, but it’s worthwhile. The part time job is great even if you’re a goof off in the rest of your life, you’ll have this one stability on which to hang your hat."
good,Good place to advance your career n grow excellent pay n benefits. Nice environmental to work in.if you like meeting new people ups is the place to work..
good,"Working for UPS has been the highlight of my entire working career. It’s a competitive job yet it pays off when stuck out. I have not had a day that has made me rethink working there; yes there are tough days and trying times, yet I still know this job will be my career and will provide me with everything I need and want in life."
good,"Excellent job with great pay, benefits and pension...and job security. If you like to keep active and meet new people this is definitely the job for you."
good,Ups showed me there’s more than just coming to work and punching in a clock . I’ve gain relationships in those I would like to call friend. It showed me how you can start at the bottom and work your way up to the top.
good,Great job great love great people being around just being inthe trucks is a piece of mind i love ups best job i ever had great management you can get great insurance for free you can get school reimbursement
good,Working for UPS is an amazing job. The hours are good and the pay rate is excellent. Its an overall good paying job and I love working with my driver we conversate a lot and we work very hard at our job.
good,What I learned about ups was that at that particular job was that you had to be a fast paced worker to work there because on busy days worked moved very fast everyone was working and loading up trucks very fast and also working at ups taught me how to become a better worker also.
good,As a driver helper all i do is help the driver deliver packages to houses and business locations. Sometimes me and the driver would be making pickups as well.
good,"I was a seasonal worker as a truck driver helper delivering packages in my city. I always felt energetic at my job jumping on and off the truck. My driver was really awesome, delivered in a nice area. Got good hours during the seasonal time"
good,"UPS is a fantastic place to work with good pay and growth opportunities and a supportive work culture."
good,This is by far the best place to work. It is very fast paced but fun at the same time. There is always a sense of accomplishment when finishing for the day. The pay is wonderful. The benefits are spectacular. Just an all around great place to work.
good,"They gave me the opportunity to learn a lot of things wich makes me feel grateful."
good,"I was hired in November 2019 for the position of a Seasonal Driver Helper. The pay is $14/hr, in High Point, NC. I went in for the ""interview"", and was hired on that day... and started working about 1.5 weeks later. The interview process was simple- walk in agree to the safety and appearance guidelines for UPS, give your availability, sign some documents and show your 2 forms of ID. They let you know straight up that this isn't a job for lazy people, or those who don't like to communicate and abide by their guidelines. The rules are ALL tattoos must be covered, your hair has to be shoulder length- if not, you must tie it up, no beards or goatees - mustaches allowed. I have hand tattoos, neck and many other visible tattoos and just wear gloves and collared shirts and a scarf. I have long hair and tie it up. You must buy your own SLIP RESISTANT work boots. You are REQUIRED to have them. I bought a pair of slip resistant LUGZ for $35 at Shoe Show. A typical day is the Driver texting each morning around 8 am to give the ok to meet at our specified location each day at 11,  I put on the UPS vest that's kept on the truck. Use the 3 point system to get on and off the truck, and deliver packages to residential houses. My job is part time so I average about 3-5.5 hrs a day mon to sat. The job is easy, you must be physically fit and fast to do this job. Honestly, I've never worked a seasonal job nor a job like this at all...but i freaking love it, and am hoping to be hired on part time as a package handler.  fyi package handlers who are part time also receive the same benefits as full"
good,Worked both seasonally and part/time over several periods spanning from 18-40 years of age. Always enjoyed working there. Their business model and practice of hiring and promoting from within is great for morale and their wages are fair.
good,There a lot going on there cause it's always busy and u always have to be on top of what u are doing cause it can get crazy at UPS never  Boring always learning something.
good,I hope to get the job and show how much work i can put into anything you give me to do. I think the process for the job is fair. I do not have any negative feedback.
good,"A typical day included packing and shipping objects that customers brought into the store, sorting through mail, and interacting face to face with customers."
good,Its a great place to work depending on your location the people and other workers are the nicest people you would ever meet but some are straight up A***
good,"The physical work environment is challenging and you learn achieve way more than you thought you could. Once you cut your teeth there are opportunities to move into driving, management, mechanical, logistics, and human resources.  Benefits extra include educational support and Union provided benefits of insurance and assistance programs."
good,Ups has great benefits for their employees. The pay should be a little more for the hard labor the package handlers do especially around peak season. They have multiple positions within the job to apply to
good,Excellent company to work for. Great people and environment. They gave me all the tools I needed to succeed and the management team were friendly and very helpful.
good,I love being a part of the UPS family thanks for giving me this opportunity to become employee and learn to elevate my experience in logistics and mail delivery.  THANK YOU
good,I would usually work overnight the work would be easy at the start buh get harder & tiring as time went on. The Hardest part was to wake up in the night/morning time. Also to lift up certain size boxes.
good,"UPS challenges its employees to be their best and rewards with good pay and benefits.  UPS stresses customer service, employee safety and teamwork.  I enjoyed all 32 years that I worked there."
good,"Great place, and benefits. Several shifts and locations plus transportation during the holidays. New seasonal hires receive bonuses, overtime for all employees."
good,Love working here and you can work basically as much as you want. The downside to this is I started getting injuries. That's what the insurance is for I guess.
good,Perfect job for a college student. Must be able to work early in the morning. Very fast-paced work environment. Good pay and good benefits. Would definitely recommend!
good,If i was given more hours i would have never left. i loved working for UPS. It was a fun and exciting environment to work in.  fast paced to the point that you didn't even notice the time flying by.
good,It's a labour rewarding company to work with.  I love to work at UPS but It seems there is no opportunity to work there as permanent employees for me as I was just hired for a seasonal job.
good,"I was seasonal so a lot of the normal compensations did not apply for me.  I did love this job, unfortunanitly I was not able to be hired in because of the lack of openings, great group of guys working the morning shift though."
good,"A day in UPS is always a good day, there are going to be days where u would be stressed but overall the job its self is easy i have learned how to load heavy packages on the conveyor belt or on deliver trucks and unloading the packages as well."
good,UPS is a wonderful company that really takes care of their employees. There is always something to learn and opportunities to grow. Management is very helpful in helping employees with their career goals.
good,"I was a delivery helper and I had pretty straightforward hours but sometimes it would take longer. I loved the job. I rode on a golf cart delivering packages in a neighborhood. My trainer was great and so was my driver who dropped off my packages. If I ever had problems, I could call my trainer and he would get it fixed quick. Other than dealing with the weather at times and it only being a seasonal job, I loved that job."
good,This was my first job and I’m so very thankful for this opportunity. This job has really matured me. I wouldn’t trade this experience for anything. I’ve enjoyed training and learning. I’m very shy and this job has allowed me to open up in many ways.
good,UPS is a good employer. They offer different shifts which is very helpful.  The pay and benefits are great. Pace can feel too fast for 75 lb. packages
good,Was a delivery driver helper and honestly it was one of the best jobs I’ve worked. Keeps you super active and it’s easy to learn on the little device they give you to scan the packages. You deliver to the same area and a lot of the same people and the driver makes a real connection with them. They weren’t strict on uniform I just had to wear a ups vest and decent brown boots (because of the snow).
good,"Es una empresa muy exigente, te capacita en su visión, valía los cuales debes llevar acabo eso me hizo una formación laboral de excelencia"
good,I have been working with ups for a year and a half and I love the work atmosphere its not always ideal but the workers are very dedicated to getting the job done
good,"We move around 8,000 to 14,000 packages on any given day. All the packages are unloaded and loaded by hand, so you get a work out in while you're there."
good,"It’s 3rd shift and fast pace, goes by quick and easy, all supervisors are nice and everyone has to work hard to complete the work load. It’s a good job if you are hired"
good,Challenging work if your not in shape but there are some really great Supervisors there that really make things run a lot smoother. EXTREMELY WELL TRAINIED.
good,I went on time to my job performed all the duties I was told to do was on time had reliable transportation to work and back good work ethics team player
good,"UPS provides full and part time employment. Depending on their position, most employees work Monday-Friday. Full-time employees are paid time and a half after eight hours. Part-time employees are paid time and a half after the five hours. UPS offers employees a great deal of advancement and educational opportunities. A typical day at UPS begins with the preload loading the trucks at about 3am. The trucks leave at 9qm. The local sort begins at about 4pm. They unload feeder trucks, sort packages to trucks that are going to other places, and unload packages that drivers have picked up to go out of town. The workplace culture can be amazing when you have great supervisors and teamsters working together. The hardest part of the job is the fast paced heavy lifting. The most enjoyable part of the job is the camaraderie among teamsters. We definitely stick together through thick and thin. `"
good,I loved working at UPS.  I was able to move up from a loader to a supervisor quickly. People were great to work with and there was always something new to do.
good,Very good hours and insurance. Great people. Lots of things to do and learn. A+ in my time there. No uniforms was a plus. They will work with your family and needs.
good,"UPS definitely care for there employees, it is a great company to become apart of. The supervisors are awesome, they help you learn things that may be frustrating at first. And if your retired, or in school it’s the perfect place to pick up extra hours."
good,UPS takes care of its employees from the top to the bottom. UPS like to promote from within the company which is great for employees. UPS makes the employees feel that they really care you.
good,"The UPS was a great job, everyone looked out for one another and helped to get things done around the store fast and efficient. There was always something to do. The manager and owner are wonderful people and smart hard working women."

good,"This is was not a difficult job besides having to deal with the cold.  I enjoy a good, honest, hard days worth of work and UPS is great for that.  Every driver I had been paired with was great and thoroughly knew how to do their job quickly and efficiently."
good,The work is very fast paced and requires alot of physical demand in heavy lifting and working with potentially hazardous materials but over all the benifits beat anything else as its free health insurance that really pays off and there's even room for growth when you apply for it
good,UPS is a great place to work.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and the managers were great with the employees.  It was fast-paced which made the days go by quickly.  I was sad that the Christmas Season came to a close and my assignment ended.
good,I feel like ups packaging and handling was more for men if you do work there it’s a good  exercise  But you’ll be super tired after it all . Make sure you eat and have water or a  gatorade  Because you will be sweating .
good,"It was a seasonal job, very fast paced loading the trucks, sometimes 4-5 at a time. While I worked there it was during the winter but moving so much it only got cold on slow nights when you weren’t that active"
good,Hang in there it pays off when you retire . Good benefits .great insurance coverage for your family. Buy UPS stocks at a discount . Provides a pension they pay into it
good,They have all the benefits you'll need and more if you just graduated from high school. This position isn't for someone in their 30s or 50s. Unless you plan to break you're back for UPS.
good,I really enjoy working at UPS I enjoy working with my co workers the pay and benefits are really good and my hours are flexible enough for me to enjoy things O like to do
good,"When i worked there I was only 18 with little work experience and they gave me a wonderful opportunity even though it was just a seasonal job. I got extra hours as a package handler which helped me get more on my check. Everyone was kind and professional. I would love to go back and work for the company again, I highly recommend this job."
good,"Fue una buena experiencia laboral, aprendi a realizar el etiquetado, reparacion de paquetes y carga y descarga, lo que mas me gusto fue el buen ambiente que habia y la parte mas dificil aprender todo tan rapido"
good,I’ve worked for UPS for 25 years and have had opportunity for promotion consistently. I had many supervisors/managers over the years that were great to work for.  Also on the same token I’ve worked with and for some difficult people but that is typical of such a large employer.
good,Working at UPS there were so many opportunities to learn and grow in the company. Every day was a different experience from working with new people to working at a slower pace than usual. I was able to learn how the company runs and what the behind the scenes looks like. The management there is very professional and open to any and all employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet so many people and be able to work in a huge collaborative work environment.
good,"Perfect job to have if you are fresh out of high school trying to get entry level. If you are in college and want to work around your school schedule and make a decent pay, it’s perfect. Company promotes within first."
good,"I really enjoyed working for UPS, it just became an issue of juggling kids, homework and work hours, to balance my life accordingly. It only became an issue when my children's grades began to slip because I was rushing through their homework to get to work."
good,Ups can be a little stress full from time to time but overall a great place and company to work for. Very fast paced work environment and a extremely physical job. Great benefits and pay is good as well for the benefits you receive. And a great place for inner job growth. Overall a great place to work in my opinion
good,"UPS is a Community as much as it is a place to work, I have nothing bad to say about it, Supervisors and management make you feel welcome from the get go, when you bring them the required numbers you are serenaded, you feel like a hero. "
good,"Working at ups was great experience. Started off as a package handler then moved my way up to supervisor in a matter of months. This is a fast pace job and you will work for you money. There is plenty of opportunities  to advance in this company, you just gotta work hard"
good,It's pretty productive and you have to keep a steady pace. I like people at work with and around and you have lots of opportunity to move up. paid for benefits completely.I'm a package handler right now but I plan to be a truck driver and a really good thing about working there is that you have to go from the ground up so someone with the CDL license isn't going to come and take my spot if I have seniority.
good,"I started as a package handler 08/18, now I'm driving...I couldn't be happier. The opportunity to grow with this company is there if you want it and if you're a hard worker."
good,La empresa realmente tiene buenas prestaciones y en calidad ! Buena estabilidad y buen ambiente
good,"This is a great job for those who like a fast pace, independence, and not being stuck in an office all day.  Must be self-motivated and able to adapt to constantly-changing environments. Be prepared for anything, every day can bring different challenges including changed routes, unexpected deliveries, and unscheduled package pickups as directed by your center.  I loved the personal relationships developed between my every day customers and myself."
good,"Amazing job, with great benefits. The job is very heavy, and fast paced. Deadlines have to be met on a daily basis. All the benefits are amazing as well."
good,I liked working this job because of the hours in a night person so this was great for me I would recommend this job for anyone who want to work nights..
good,I Love it..Fast paced intense working..Everyone constantly moving and the time flies by before You know it..Nice Supervisors and The driver were also nice...
good,"Every day was fun "
good,Working for UPS was the best opportunity I ever had. Loved it the whole 5 years I worked there and the two Christmas seasons before. Solid career choice!
good,"I enjoy working at UPS, from the managers, supervisors and team members - Everyone is willing to help you succeed at your job.  It is a fast paced environment that isn't for everyone.  Coming from the logistics industry is a big help."
good,Good experience the job was fast paced. Hard work requires at all times. Very physically demanding. Stressful work environment to make shipments on time. Hours varied daily
good,"This job is for someone looking to work outside, lifting and lowering heavy boxes and working along side others in an aircraft or around an aircraft. Good for someone looking for manual labor."
good,At first UPS may seem hard and not worth it but with hard work the possibilities of grown within the company are endless.  The benefits and pay are extremely good if you stay on the union side.
good,The interview was basically none they asked the hours I would like to work told me the pay and start date. I dressed business casual but others dressed like they were walking by n came on in personally I love the job I lost weight working here you sweat like crazy very fast paced but relaxed you can be trained to drive the brown trucks which is paid training and also CDL I’ve was asked to be considered for supervisor position 3rd week there dressecode is very laid back just wear boots is perfect for part time only 3-4 hours wish was paid a little more but I like it
good,"You are basically getting paid to workout. Shifts are 4-5 hours depending on the time of year. I generally lifted packages no higher than 10 lbs, but depending on which area you work in, it can be up to 80 lbs. Great part-time work if that is what you want."
good,"I started working at a trailer hub, a few day after being there someone came to talk to me and ask me what my goal was carrer wise and I told him I wanted to work wothing the aviation industry. 5 months later I was offered the opportunity to transfer over to the airport."
good,Loved working for them. All around a pleasure to work for and with. Easy work but you have to move fast. Very organized and work friendly place. Just love to work there.
good,I recently started working at UPS and I’m currently loving the experience! You’re most definitely guaranteed to sweat as a package handler. Expect the work to be fast pace.
good,The shifts are not long which makes it easy to have a second job or take care of your family. The nights usually go by pretty quickly especially around Holidays. The worst thing about the job is some of the management can get really stressed and make it harder on the employees.
good,Good company. Stable if you do your job. Good benefits. High expectations. Not a job that will tolerate goofing off. Conservative culture. Room for growth but very competitive.
good,"If you do not have job experience or looking to get great benefits after a year at only a part-time job, United Parcel Service (UPS) is the perfect place to start at."
good,Loved the interaction at UPS. Sadly this was a contract job and ended suddenly 2 weeks before Christmas. I would have loved to have been hired permanently but there were cut backs during the time i was there. People were friendly and eager to answer questions if a problem arose.
good,Its a good job to have they just don’t give any hours. So the pay is lousy. Its not hard work but it at the same time its not easy work either. The job has its own pace.
good,I. I am proud to have worked for UPS more than 19 years.  It's a stable job with full benefits that stand behind its employees and customers.  Was privileged to retire at 56 with benefits.
good,"If you're new to the industry like me, this is a great place to start. The environment is great and the management for my team specifically is amazing. Wonderful people, flexible work schedule, and good pay for a student. Everyone is laid back and super friendly with each other. No over working, learn at your own pace. Amazing."
good,"Friendly ppl, good management, great hrs. & always busy.......... loading trucks in the morning to delivering the packages to customers. All around great place to work"
good,Genuinely one of the most fun jobs you’ll ever have. The hourly rate is generous and the hours are decent you are paid even if the work day is cut off short and you are paid overtime for extra hours. Only downside is it’s a seasonal role. Always wanted more hours
good,I loved where I work and if I could have stayed I would have they was nothing but the best and the first day was not even bad they welcome me in with no problem at all
good,I enjoy working for UPS. I have met some real nice people out there. I love the benefits they provide. The area i work in we all one big happy family. We love and respect each other. It's a job i don't mind coming to work everyday. So with that said it's a place I'm planning on retiring from one day.
good,"A typical day entails waking up early and arriving with enough time to pass through the guard station to punch in. Then I grab my Load IDs for the day and pick out a scanner before heading to whichever area of the boxline I am to work that day. I sign into my trucks--usually 3 or 4. I then begin pulling boxes from cages and placing them according to number within the assigned truck. There is an art to doing so as one must account for the volume within a certain area of the truck and also give oneself room to maneuver as the day progresses while limiting the amount of stacking out one does and being careful not to violate egress so as to keep a clear walking path. The people are friendly, but the language is really rough and its not uncommon to be within earshot of a flared temper. During my training period management and supervisors would constantly critique my performance and add approval where seen fit. The critiquing got me to where I needed to be performance wise but I had to fight off feelings of discouragement. I now have a strong appreciation for how hard these men (and women) do work. The most enjoyable part of the job is easily the mid-shift PCM/break. Pro-tip: drink plenty of water!"
good,If anybody ask me I will tell them I love you ups but you better be able to stand on your feet over 10 hours but after 5 hours is overtime and UPS have a good union
good,The workday was very fast paced. There was a fair time for a lunch break and then it was back at it. The customers were always happy to get their package and were very friendly.
good,This is the best delivery company that I've ever work for besides FedEx both of them are very good understanding fast-paced environment customer service base and do not have a higher turnover rate best place good benefits good pay rate
good,The work is a little hard but yall get used to it for a couple weeks pay it good but coworkers are another thing some of them rude some nice choose wisely to ve friends with
good,Its very fast paced and at times it seems like it's a little too fast paced. Especially during peak season it seems like it never ends. Management is good but they dont honor seniority here so it's kind of pointless.  Good pay rate plus great benefits
good,I would love to still be at UPS. They paid well and the job loading the unloading tractor-trailers was easy to me. I started school at night Monday-Thursday and those are the hours I worked at UPS. I tried working the day shift but had to be there at 4am but I didn't get home until 11pm from school. I did it for a while but just wore out.
good,"You must have tough skin. My pay was always great. Diverse place to work in. Lazy management,  lazy workers, favortism at an all time high. I miss the job but not the people."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. Shorter shifts and great benefits, including health insurance and tuition completely paid for. This company gave me many opportunities to grow and develop my skills."
good,Working at UPS is hardwork. Staying hydrated is a absolute necessity. Great benefits and management is excellent. Mental and physical toughness is needed to complete the tasks at hand
good,I was able to gain invaluable training and qualifications at ups. I also was able to advance giving me the ability to provide as a single mother for my family.
good,UPS is a fast pace work environment. That requires you to sort thru packages in a timely manner and make sure they are going to the right shipment address when being delivered.
good,Loved working for ups. Great people. Coworkers were supportive. Management was pretty awesome until they moved me into another location that was unorganized and understaffed.
good,"It takes too long for advancement,the benefits are great,medical dental vision and 401K.Things at ups are done every minute of the day,whether you are on unload or load side.I learned Alot there."
good,We usually had a fast pace work day. Management was always helpful and making sure they helped us reach our goals. Was it a very relax workplace but we were also pushed to reach our goals.
good,I enjoyed my position as diver helper the driver was very appreciative of my help i want to in the future become a driver for them the benefits are awesome and advancement happens quickly with performance.
good,"UPS is a fair and reliable job. The lack of hours for part timers may be a little in fair but the benefits make up for it. I’m trying to pick up a full time job as well, so that I can be more help to my family and my future. I have learned how to load properly and be a team player."
good,A solid work place if you can keep on your feet and make the work count. Have t o be on time and ready to ride along with any number of drivers. have to stay safe as well as fast on your feet to get the packages delivered
good,Had lots of flexibility. Management was nice and understanding. Had to be able to work at a fast paste. Lots of opportunity to grow within the company.
good,"I love working here. I intend to retire from UPS. The hours are almost always rock steady, and you know what to expect when coming into work. Overall a great place to work, with management that cares about you."
good,Ups is a great company. The only down side is everything is part time. Other than that great. Tbey keep the emoyees in mind with all tbings. I would recommend them.
good,UPS can be a physically demanding and stressful job. The hours can be long and working conditions in extreme heat and cold can be a challenge. The great pay and benefits in my opinion compensate for the challenging work conditions.
good,"Role was repetitive, however when issues came up you just had to learn how to deal with things knowing that certain tasks had to be executed before the shift ended. If you have great staff like I did, they will make sure you learn everything you need to know."
good,Its a good company to work for i would recommend this job for anyone who is looking to build a career with a company and they have exceptional benefits
good,I would go back to ups but it’s just I lost my vehicle and could make it there anymore due to no buses or trains ran anywhere near it from were I live
good,"Busy at work at all times always something to do the staff is wonderful and are always willing to assist in your advancement ."
good,All the employees are really nice with each other. You can tell they care about one another beyond the work area. This job offers a lot of benefits. It is also guaranteed that you will move up and get promoted
good,Working at UPS was an very interesting experience I learned more about the company and it mission and goals which motivated me to work harder. I enjoyed my time at UPS I would recommend anyone to try UPS as an employer.
good,Very people oriented company. Excellent benefits. Promote from within. Above average employees are hired. Expectations are well defined.  Good retirement program. Team oriented. Great place to work.
good,"UPS offers awesome benefits ( which i guess compensates for the pay). You do receive raises and the longer you're there, the better off you are. UPS is a great company to GROW with. Def not recommended for people looking for an ""easy job"" or temporary job."
good,"It is an extremely stressful environment at times, it is super fast paced but if you land with a good supervisor they make the day a lot easier. They have great pay and some amazing benefits after just 9 months."
good,"UPS is a very rewarding place to work.... it is a CAREER..not a 9-5 job. If you are in management and willing to put in a minimum of 50 hrs. per week, you will be financially set for rest of your life. With the pay into the 6 figures, sales commission and stock options, most UPS management people can retire as millionaires. UPS also offers current retirees a great pension at 55 yrs of age along with FULLY paid healthcare benefits."
good,"I enjoyed my time at UPS and would work there again!"
good,I started as a driver with ups and Dro for 8 years I went into management and was in management for 23 years when I left I was in charge of to Center I managed 48 drivers and five Clerks I dispatched them on a daily basis on their routes and train the clerks to be able to take packages and ship packages.
good,"no complaints, work is well layed out. you know what you have to complete once you leave the yard, bosses fuss consyantly but its just a high paced environment a lot of deadlines with a non stop timeline.."
good,"Pretty decent pay, can be a lot of work at times. Management was very professional. The people there are great too and really helped me through a tough time in my life. J.B."
good,Very fast paced work. Most be done in a timely manner. Hard on the body and very stressful. Coworkers are very nice and knowledgeable about the Union.
good,"Loved my job, Co-workers, Management.  Busy, fast pace office.  The hardest part was seeing a Company have to close their Business.  "
good,"The long hours and fast pace environment meeting new people not have to get up so early, weekly pay is always great, extremely high workouts if you were trying to lose weight"
good,"Load truck with packages for deliver to homes, so that that can be received before Christmas.  Had to place items in the correct truck so that they can be shipped to the correct address."
good,"Take attendance, assign work trailer and most important is to make sure everyone works safe. I went from unloader to supervisor in a month. Management is always pushing you either to to better, or for advancement opportunities. Best part is all the relationships you make and the hardest as leaving after 5 years."
good,"I had to leave because my family was moving, and I hated going. Everyone was great and the supervisors are very supportive and understanding people. When I left I was given an amazing going away gift."
good,"The workplace was a good environment, and everyone everyone had a role and they did very well on it,at times there were times we would get out late but work had to be done an the vibe was fun and outgoing"
good,it can be stressful but majority of everyone works as a team. management at this particular facility work with you and is understanding. if you can't handle  extreme temperatures then this would not be a good job but I look at it as its like your getting paid to go to a gym. I have been here for over 3 years and love it!
good,It just started at the UPS it’s a great work environment and I got hired on the spot and there’s tons of room to move up. They pay for school up to $5000 per month and they are union
good,"UPS & IBT provide the best part timer benefits out there. Supervisors are cool as long as you come prepared to do your job and don't act like an jerk while your doing it. UPS hires from within so you always have room to advance to being a driver, among other positions. Pay is above average for the job your doing. Only complaint I have for my center is the scanners."
good,"UPS is a great job with flexible scheduling , friendly environment overall I would recommend anyone who is looking for a full time or part time job to work with UPS, Great benefits and much more !"
good,The job I got was for someone straight out of college with little real world experience.  I learned about technical support and help desk roles and was able to utilize some of my college experience with SQL server.
good,"UPS is a great place to work and offers great benefits.  The environment is no frills and co-workers are interesting.  There is lots of customer interaction during the day both in person and on the phone.  Like other places I have worked, the hardest part is learning the abbreviations and acronyms used but once that is mastered, it's easier."
good,Get a lot of daily exercise. Driver willing to help deliver packages and may need a little help finding the house but often tells you where to go and a good place to put the package and warns you if there's an agressive animal around
good,The educational benefit with UPS was a key component for me to advance my education in the area of IT certifications and personal development (college).
good,"compared to similar jobs, pay by hour is decent. hours can be barley enough. not worth it unless youre in it for the long run, or trying to move up in management."
good,"peak season driver long days, brown trucks have no car charger plug ins. Unfamiliar with the routes, new drivers get way to many items to deliver. Staff is very helpful and always willing to help."
good,"Fast paced environment, enjoy working with those around me, hardest part of the job is the packages that can be difficult at times. Overall good company to work with"
good,"Great employees. Bosses can be jerks occasionally, but that's true of any job. Everyone at UPS, except top management, is a part time employee so they can be flexible with your hours..... Within reason."
good,This place is a grate place to work there is a grate team environment. The managers there are very well trained and love there job. It was a very physical job but you can beat the benefits
good,"I was a Temp Driver for UPS , Good Management, and supportive"
good,"I enjoy working at UPS. I have played baseball all my life and my Full timer is tuff. The way he teaches he will get on you and push you to your limits and at times it may seem like he is being mean or anything that, but in reality he pushes us to do our best because he believes and trusts in our abilities when it comes to our job."
good,"UPS is a great place for growth. Ups  offers skills and opportunities that can be taken on to further careers and future opportunities, such as tuition assistance. Great place to manifest your goals."
good,great experienced coworkers that can show you the ropes and how to do things. Fast paced job that constantly has you on the move so time flies by. Great environment overall.
good,Great company to work for. Learned how to move at the speed of business and on a timely matter. Learned responsibility  and how to work and deal with different customers
good,"Helped many people ship out packages, retrieved packages for customers who were not home when the UPS driver attempted delivery. Pretty laid back as long as you got your job done."
good,"Everyday was challenging, productive and a team effort. We had a family atmosphere within a large corporation. Great management support for training and problem solving. "
good,The times were hard for me having a four year old in school. But other than that the best company to work for. Management awesome even Human Resources.
good,"Excellent benefits for part-time employess and family when I worked there. Great environment, fast paced and pay was good for some extra income. Opportunity to move up especially if you continued your education."
good,"Love my job, just didn't pay well enough for my living cost in the area of which i lived. I would work there again, there will have to be more benefits and pay incentives to retire to."
good,I really like working for UPS even though I was on a seasonal contract. They have a great compensation package. And the supervisors that work with me were very helpful. Still waiting to be hired as a full-time driver
good,I enjoyed working at ups it was a simple and easy relaxing job where you don’t have to worry about making a mistake and having someone be extremely upset
good,fast paced work environment working with friendly hard working people that works together as a team to get the job done in a timely fashion & when you finish in your area you go see if they need help in other areas
good,"If you like physical work this is a job for you. Everything revolves around safety, safe driving and good decision making. Most employees in the building complained but there’s a lot of factors to aggravate you in one day driving. Those paychecks kept me motivated and you’re pretty much guaranteed overtime every week. The only issue I would say is how competitive it is to keep a job there. I was hired for seasonal cyber Monday- xmas eve.  For anyone wondering cover driver, part time, full time all receive full time hours (for the most part) the main difference is how high your pay can go up. In other words, unless you’re in a big city goodluck getting a ‘fulltime’ Job.  Seniority matters. So get your foot in the door ASAP. Peak season will keep the back of your truck jam packed so don’t expect anything easy and 6 day work weeks. Thank you UPS for the opportunity!"
good,Great. Stay busy be productive.  Hours are there if you want overtime. Some times there are dry spells when your sent home early causing lost of hours
good,ups was good I enjyed working here but we were laid off due to only being hiried for the busy season. THis was my first job so it was great I like being active due to it helped me on my work outs.
good,"Working at UPS was a lonely and stressful job. Your typical day consisted of seeing only a few people in your inbound or outbound area, checking in with your manager before and after your shift, and working in a trailer alone for multiple hours at a time. Since I am a very outgoing person, this was a temporary job for me and I knew from the minute I started to work at UPS that it was not the job for me. The hardest part was not being able to bring my phone in to the building to listen to music while working, but as a manager I believe you could bring your phone into the building."
good,UPS was a very different and intense work environment. It can really bring out the best in someone. Waking up every morning at three in the morning and getting my operation ready and my employees started was an everyday task for me.  The culture at UPS is a deep one. The most enjoyable part is being involved in a huge operation filled with all types of people to meet one common goal. The hardest part would definitely be waking up early and the physicality of the job.
good,"Excellent opportunity with the company, the hardest part of the job would be the lack of progression, you begin to get a feeling of being just a number. A company as large as UPS has so many employees I feel that they are not able to reach all of the potential candidates when considering someone for a raise or promotion."
good,"UPS is a great company to work for, whether short term or willing to stay in the company. Great environment, flexible hours and they promote from within. Do not regret working for UPS."
good,"UPS is a place where and you can honestly make a good living,  you can advance as long as you are a good worker,  management does listen and UPS is always interested in your opinion. The work environment can be stressful at times but all you need to do is take a moment and breathe and get back to business. It's a company that tells you upfront overtime is mandatory as well as satisfying the customer is a must. This is a great company and I would recommend it to anybody."
good,"Full on and hard work, the pace of which was fun and a good challenge. I enjoyed the customer-facing role. The pay is very good and worth the hard work for it. The management was helpful when there was mistakes to sort out"
good,"Fast paced, outdoor position that involves continual lifting, lowering and carrying packages that typically weigh 25- 75 lbs. "
good,"At UPS, I currently supervise employees who load and sort to outbound trucks.  I've expanded my leadership skills, number production and interpersonal skills. Challenging but rewarding position."
good,At Ups i learned about the process of delivering and interacting with customers at their homes and work places with parcels they ordered online. I worked well with the drivers.
good,"This job is a good job to work for. "
good,"A fun fast paced teamwork enviorment.  With a good chance to advance to a better postion. Fairly quickly. Everyone is friendly and willing to help you, or awnser any questions. They have a very good training process. They are also very safety orientated. Safety first is stressed daily. A Very good place to work with competive wages. The supervisor`s are fair and communicate well also. They keep you in the loop on changing conditions. Be it scheduling ' weather conditions. How the terminal is doing as compared to other terminals in the state. Any  Changes in format or procedures. A fun place to work. During peak season. Thanksgiving to Christmas. It gets very fast paced. but you also earn overtime and  it only lasts for a month. And the overtime is based on anything  over 8 hrs each day. Rather than anything over 40 hrs in a week I like my part time job there. One of the biggest bonus`s I feel. Is after working there part time for a  year. The employee gets health insurance for not only self. But for your whole family and the company pays for it all. So i`d have to say they take very good care of their employees.There are more pros than cons. It is also a  clean organized work place. Every thing is labeled and easy to find ."
good,The typical day was hard. I learned how to pull orders and load them. The management was fair grade. There was a lot of culture. The hardest part of the job was the sweating part. The most enjoyable part of the job was the free water and beverages they provided.
good,Seasonal work was fast-paced and UPS associates/seasonal workers work as a cohesive team.  Tabue Hub is being remodeled and we were able to meet all peak deadlines.
good,"Great part time job, none better. Great pay and best benefits in the nation. Everyone is approachable from the President to the General manager. I would recommend this for young kids just graduating from high school because of the college tuition reimbursement."
good,New hires are trained with all tools needed to perform well and enjoy work. The company as a whole is progressive and very meticulous with all procedures at all locations.
good,Just very fast speed alil hard nice safety zone very clean place and very loud the ppl are very nice the driver's are nice and respected the other workers help if your behind
good,"Worked only for peek season. Manager gave me many chances to come back to work. I was just physically starving myself not purposely, and I was drinking vitamins with an empty stomach. I was just messing myself up not purposely. This is my reason for leaving."
good,Huge company and plenty of experience. Learned many skills and perfected team work along with communication and accountability. Excellent hands on training along with managerial skills established.
good,Workinng As A Package Handler For UPS Was A Great Experience. I Was Able To Test Myself To See If I Can Handle The Tasks That Were Giving. You Have To Work At A Steady Fast Past. But Overall I Loved Working For Them The Environment And The People Was Great
good,"Fast pace but nice"
good,"If you get a job here and stick it out, the benefits are exceptional. The current wait for part-time work is changing from 1 year to 9 months and will cover full insurance for you, your spouse and children. Part-timers also get up to $2500 for school."
good,"I loved my driving career with UPS, now that I am retired, I do miss it everyday.  I was very hard work but very rewarding. Great pay and benefits.  Awesome retirement."
good,"I enjoy sorting and unloading packages at UPS. I enjoy the relaxed work environment, such as being able to wear causal clothes to work.  I enjoy the fast paced environment."
good,"UPS is a highly competitive environment that is a high demand job.  You will never be bored at UPS.  It is a good job to work.  A typical day is non-stop action with breaks as needed.  I learned to manage time, to manage work, and to balance goals with day to day needs.  The hardest part of the job was the amount of ours worked.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the people you worked with."
good,Going in early in the morning it’s very hard and very fast paced you are constantly moving in and out of trucks loading the boxes. But at 9 o clock in the morning you get to go home and have the rest of the day to do whatever
good,"It's pretty hard work at first, but within about a month your body gets used to it and its not as bad. One of there mottos is to ""make 8 hours of work into 4"" meaning to always work very hard and fast paced."
good,"Fast pace walking up and down steps on truck and to address on package to be delivery. Make deliveries in rain, sleet or snow. "
good,"This is not an easy job can be stressful."
good,"I personally think UPS is a perfect side job, with a straight forward set of responsibilities. As well as a good amount of benefits provided for anyone who is thinking about joining the union. I would highly recommend as a side job, if you are looking for a few more bucks to squeeze in that day."
good,It depends who you end up working around and who your managers are but it a really fast pace and fun environment. It's a great work out/maintain you physique kind of job.
good,This job was a good job but I left due to only getting 2 hours a day and it wasn’t enough for me to live off of. Would recommend if you need a job in the afternoon since my shift was from 5 to 10
good,Had a very great driver he was very helpful in training. Company is very safety orientated. Seasonal positions are very challenging but rewarding. Very fast paced.
good,Started UPS was making $13 an hour then they brought me up to $14 an hour but the fact is only work 20 hours a week and I have to show up 5 days a week for 4 hours a day and I lived all the way in Lewisville and my job was in Dallas and I was riding the bus at the time so I I had bad Transportation at that time but the money was worth it
good,I was a driver helper for the Christmas Season at UPS.  I enjoyed losing weight as I delivered the packages to the houses.  I also enjoyed the people I was able to meet.
good,I actually got 20 under their 250 boxes per hour needed quota. The managers were very understanding about how new people would need to ease into this job environment. The six weeks of training that I did there before I left was very well done as they would show us all of the safety requirements that we would need to follow whenever we would be in the warehouse.
good,"As a delivery driver peak season helper, you're to be quick on your feet and to know where the best place is, to put the package at the customers doors. This job was a good experience, and I would have liked to been texted more often from the day I was hired to be able to work. Even though the job was seasonal, I felt like I was overlooked more than once. The most enjoyable part of the job, was when the customers would thank you for delivering their packages!"
good,It’s a good and fast paced work environment to which you are not confined to a small work place but rather a whole city as your work place I did much enjoy my time their
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS as a seasonal helper . Pay was fair , hours make up for it. The supervisors take their job seriously,  overall a good work environment."
good,Packing the trucks are very easy. The hours were manageable and the staff were very understanding. I worked on the purple belt and gray belt a lot and it was nice to make new associates at work. As long as you made sure your shoot was cleared than you were doing a good job.
good,"good steady work. Union is great. Good end game for a career. Everyone starts in the warehouse which isn't great, but being a driver is a solid career."
good,I was only i seasonal worker at ups but i loved the job and i had a really cool manager. The work was easy but it was also quick paced. I loved the job i did there even if it was a really short time and i would definitely work there again if i could.
good,"its noisy at the hub, but its fun and people and boss, supervisor are friendly as long you do your job properly and follow rules and regulations. not easy job but its a good exercise though."
good,I've learned alot from working at ups. Helped me to even be considered for my current job. Really easy and very understandable. All employees are very respectful and trust worthy. im not sure how it is now but when I was employed it was really great.
good,Easy work and If you don’t like working long hours during the day then it’s perfect for you.  Kinda strict with phones and anything really. Just work and be safe.
good,Loved this job tremendously. It was only part time but pay was reasonable. Worked Preload which was fast paced and hard. Your mornings went by so fast though and co workers are very welcoming and helpful. Management at Estrella location was the absolute best. I was going through a lot in my personal life and they eased my mind for sure. My personal Life issues and lack of communication on my part is why I was discharged and Now I am seeking new employment.
good,"The job can help you will a lot of things in life that you can afford. It has good benefits, good security, and good culture. The management is good, but I've been terminated for a humor that was taken the wrong way. Other than that, it's acceptable."
good,Guter Arbeitgeber nur gute Erfahrung gesammelt . kann ich nur weiterempfehlen.
good,"I was the owner of the UPS store in wixom."
good,"the work is hard and fast pace but the benefits are great.they have a union that protects employees, the work is stable and opportunity for advancement."
good,its a good job it just dont give people enough hours to pay their bills and im looking for a fulltime job that i can stay on to pay my bills and my car note
good,UPS is a fast paced company. Most people in my position there are treated like just another number in the system. It was busy and a smooth environment.
good,I’ve worked there 15 years it’s a very demanding physical job but I’ve enjoyed it ! It’s definitely not a place for the lazy or the non PR person you have to be able to communicate with the customer and people!
good,A typical work day is very productive non stop busy day. Get to work with different cultures everyday while also getting to learn new work ethics about yourself.
good,"I very much enjoyed my 30 years at UPS. I developed many skills including training on the B757/767, MD-11, B747-100-200-4-- and -8. I was a simulator instructor, a CRM course developer and facilitator and was a FAA designated check airman."
good,"helping driver deliver packages, learned how to scan and sign board, it was fast paced, enjoyed the challenge, got to meet new people, wasn't boring because we were always going to different places."
good,I like job the job very well. I was a hard working. I was always on time to work. You get overtime everytime you stay and help and other shift. Managament was fair with the employees
good,"Every day is different. Challenging work that you need to take in stride. They have you work hard, but you feel proud to work for such a company. The pay and benefits are great."
good,"Long, haard working, and tiring. A good learning experience to be involved with. A good workout to do while making great money at the same time. A typical day at work usually is a fast past experience at all times."
good,Uma empresa com uma cultura muito forte e focada no bem estar dos funcionarios
good,The workplace culture was good. The people that works there were friendly and very helpful. The job was demanding and performance was high in the employers.
good,There are a lot of opportunities for advancement within the company and they pride themselves on promoting from within for higher positions. The benefits that are offered are fitting of a world-class company as well.
good,"I started out as a peak box loader and was promted to supervisor about 8 months later. I worked hard and found meaning in working hard. Being a package handler is a whole nother beast. The pay is to good to pass up a promotion despite increased responsabilities. 19.30hr im 19 years old. UPS helped me find my motivation to exceed in other aspects of life. It teaches you determination and managment skills. A typical day involves me setting up my boxline. And scanning boxes in trucks for misloads. Then taking care of all the odds and ends. Open/broken boxes wrong labels leakers and things like that. I do this all well supervising my employees and making sure they do what they need to do. On a bad day which there are many I am responsible for covering the workload of an employee that didnt show up as well as my other responsibilities. In my opinion the people with the worst expierences have the worst attitudes. Having a good attitude is everything at UPS. If you have a crumy attitude you will not enjoy your job, youll hate it. You will eventually find it gratifying to push yourself and do a good job. Managment is tough because it has to be but if you work hard and do your job the people there can be very fun and playful. My coworkers are good dudes and very funny. Management always had food for us and rewards like UPS clothing. They gave a way xboxes in raffles and reward supervisors with ps4 games. The CEO started as a package handler and worked his way up. There is always opportunities to rise through the ranks. The job is quick paced but my adhd brain enjoys that. I couldnt imagine"
good,Loaded and unloaded trucks in a fast paced environment. Sorted packages by city and zip code. Scanned packages for tracking purposes. Lots of room for advancement.
good,"I was working here for UPS Chain Solutions as a subcontractor for an outside company to manage and take care of this order machines and other machines around the warehouse, I was third shift and I worked it for 4 years the company I work for was based in California so there was only three employees and three shifts in the Illinois division which meant there was no room for advancement but with that being said it was still a great place to work in a company is great"
good,It’s a fast pace working environment you get to unload airplanes Lord airplanes unload bellies unload trailers at the airport nice place to work for Just the current manager it’s not too nice
good,"Typical day @ a UPS store involves, packing/shipping via UPS, USPS & DHL, sorting mail and packages, notarizing legal documents. Printing various documents, flyers, posters and banners when requested."
good,Company do take care of his own and cares about hiring and promoting within. Benefits are second to none. Retirement plan is also an excellent choice and great for long term employees.
good,"But you are reduced to part-time hours and there are no full-time positions available unless you drive or become management.  The pay is great for Union Employees and Managers, but non-union employees get the short end of the stick."
good,I did a lot I drove k loaders took packages on an off planes sorted them on the sort department. Also I pushed and pulled containers. I even drove tugs around the yard
good,"you unload all the trucks that or coming in with packages. practice the safety rules. the hard part is the over 75 pound boxes you cant lift , so u gotta get help"
good,I was there part time during the Christmas season and boy it was a rush all this boxes everywhere.   Good pal be to work if u got out of school and fat paced
good,Very fun job! I miss this job. If you need a job get ahold of UPS. It is a great paying job especially if you are fresh out of high school! fun environment as well!!
good,"I love working at UPS, great benefits, good career advancement.  I've learned & developed computer skills which has been an asset to my skill set.  The management team is very helpful on work place environment.  Each job you advance in gives you good training.  Being on time is a big part & having integrity which makes it a great place to work."
good,You can start here as a package handler and in a few years become a driver and make great money. It takes 4 years for top wage but if your young or a student it's a good place to start. Job can be physically demanding at times. You are working in every weather condition in a warehouse . Postings go up all the time for driver positions and they promote from within before going outside the building .
good,"This company has something for everyone. Part-time, full-time, seasonal, there is a spot for you here. Opportunities for advancement are plentiful, so if you are motivated, the sky is the limit. They promote from within."
good,I enjoyed being an intern ta UPS. I believe I was paid well and enjoyed coming to work every day. My only down side was they did not offer any position at the end of my internship.
good,UPS is a great company. It is one of the best companies that I have had the opportunity to work for during my professional career.  I would highly recommend the culture is great they are focused on a sustainable future with the company when you work there as an employee.  There are many people  that have spent 5 to 30 years as seasoned employees with the company.
good,"Un bel lavoro si lavora su turni , i caposquadra tutti gentili"
good,U.P.S. was a great place to work. management were great people. Fast paced felt like a workout everyday. Was never a dull moment. Great co workers. my only complaint was very little hours as UPS only hires part time. Great place though for someone with schooling.
good,loading trucks is not easy but very confusing at times. you will have to be up at many different times in the early morning. this job demands a lot of your body
good,"Great place to work! I wish I could go back. Some issues with Management. Offered classes, internal and external. Always came me time off to attend my children's school events."
good,"You come in clock in and wait until its the ususal time for the trucks to start bringing you your trailer. Loader your trailers and when you are done with that or if you don't have anymore packages coming, get out and help out on Eregs."
good,"Great people, the employees at UPS are well trained and conditioned to work hard, work fast and most importantly, work safe. I enjoyed the team atmosphere, it is always about working together to reach the common goal of safety, Service and production."
good,"Honestly, the culture is not supportive of business owners at all. At times is was quite difficult to adhere to new directives that came from corporate"
good,"You get paid to workout. If you like a fast paced job, this is the place to work. You'll meet new friends and coworkers every day. Management is understanding and fair."
good,"Business services includes., Account set ups. Notarizations, Printing packaging and receiving. claims on all lost or damaged packages shipping international and domestic"
good,It was a great job just not enough pay for all you do and all the overtime you put in especially during the holidays but other than that great place to work
good,"I loved my season as a Driver Helper. By far, the best work experience ever. The drivers were great. It was a hard day. When winter really hit, it was terrible. Still fun and awesome pay. UPS has great benefits. Definitely think of getting a good pair of safety sneakers. Something light. Boots were too heavy and my knees hurt so bad near the end of the day. Gloves that fit right to your hands with grip. Long hours and a lot of lifting. Make sure to learn the DIAD. You can get into a career there through being a Driver Helper. I hope any of this helps. It really is a great company."
good,Fast Paced
good,"I liked working at UPS but I worked only seasonal so they would let me go after the busy season. Friendly people, good managers and great culture. I learned working in UPS that some employees are thieves."
good,"All you need is a pair of boots & gloves you’ll be set to go. UPS is not a job for everyone I see a lot of people come and go, but as long as you work the boxes and don’t let them work you this job becomes easy as you go."
good,"Was an a.m. preloader and had to be very swift at any work position. Was dock work, so was a rather dirty work environment, but made up for with great coworkers and hard work performed very fast. Occassionally handled heavy products exceeding 100+ lbs. A great, long- term career job with advancement, benefits, retirement, 401K"
good,UPS has a relaxed although fast paced atmosphere. The management team is easy to talk to with an open door policy. There is a strong team work atmosphere.
good,"UPS is a very fast paced job. Each day was filled with new task to complete. There is a timeframe to get certain activities completed. The management is great and very helpful. The workplace is peaceful, there are no hard parts of the job. I enjoy the fast pace of the job, and the pay rate."
good,It was a great place to work but I wish I could of been full-time I was jus a driver helper but I enjoyed wat I was doing. I am a hard worker and I am a person that can adapt to any type of flow of work that I do I can get along with anybody and I am good at whatever it is I do

good,I really like that I was working at ups because they move in a fast pace and also have good hours. I would prefer to work there again in the future. It is a good place to work.
good,"Absolutely love working there. Fast pace, great company to work for.  Yearly raises, and great medical benefits. Protected by Union.  Would recommend to anyone without a job"
good,I was laid off due to site shutting down.  Normal day consisted of troubleshooting and system maintenance.  Enjoyed coworkers and environment.  Would definitely recommend this job to others if the company had stayed here.
good,I like it it’s fun but the only thing is it can get very hot in there lol. The managers are great they actually sit down and tell you how the day is supposed to be. Co workers can be a little annoying at times but they know what they doing and we get the job done
good,"UPS was a great place to work. They offer you benefits and nice pay. Everyone is friendly and ready to work to get the job done, was a great experience."
good,"What I did at ups was basically sorting packages. After the initial week training, they started me out loading trucks. Then they switched me to the second floor. Basically we had to memorize 60 zip codes in the city a long with each color that goes with each zip code and place the packages on to the belt. The work is very fast paced."
good,"UPS is a very fast pace type of job. Working for a job like UPS helps you to focus more by making sure the right packages go to the right truck, or location in the facility. My fellow co-workers made the job much easier and fun."
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS as a seasonal driver helper because it was not that hard first off, and they pay you great. Each day you have the chance to meet a new driver, which kept the job different. Fun job."
good,"I loved working for ups they were welcoming fun sometimes fast paced sometimes slow paced, I love the physical work and the people I worked with or had times where I was in my own zone and that was okay too, they paid well would of been living if I had a full time job there but for part time they paid very well."
good,"Great place to work, no need for a gym membership! You will be sore if you work in the warehouse. Management is cool, very friendly and helpful. Always willing to help if not busy"
good,"You most like will be working the 11:00pm to 3:30 shifts starting off."
good,Very good company to work for. Consistent training to keep up to date with todays changes in the logistics world. Offers a very good benefit package as well as a competitive salary.
good,One of the funnest jobs I've worked I mean it's hard work but you make it a good time with the people you work with . Very fast paced job but not to bad to where you hate life.
good,Extremely fast paced.  Precision was required.  Lifting of heavy boxes onto a conveyor belt. Very hot inside of the trucks.  Needed to pay close attention as you are unloading boxes for safety.
good,"Great place to work for,  job security, great benefits, hours of operations are absolutely perfect. Would definitely recommend anyone going to school that this job has flexibile hours of operations."
good,"UPS has been a fantastic place for me to work during college. I wish to continue my career there, however there isn’t much room for advancement in my area. I loved my job as a pt prelod supervisor and would work there for 40 more years if I could go full time"
good,Honestly. It was the best job I've ever had and I screwed it up myself.  It's hard to get fired and I managed to do that. It sucks to think about. If you get a chance to be a driver.  Do it.
good,"Productive and serious workplace; with a real since of customer satisfaction: both Internal customer and External customer satisfaction."
good,"When it was time to leave in order to fulfill my career goals, I was sad to leave UPS because I absolutely loved working there. Really nice company and place to work for."
good,"A fortune 500 company, A head of its competitors. Start out a driver and promoted to management. A typical day is working 10 hours."
good,"it was a nice job at the time. i enjoy working at ups, but the hours was too  little and the pay wasn't much so i had to look for a better paying job."
good,"Nonostante sia un'azienda enorme, ai tempi del mio ingresso contava più di 1.000 dipendenti, è incredibile il senso di appartenenza che sa creare e infondere nei suoi dipendenti, a qualsiasi livello."
good,Ups is a great job to work at there a lot you can learn. There is different areas that you can work in. You can work in the warehouse or you can be a driver.
good,"United Parcel Service is what I call a real equal opportunity employer. They gave me a job after the 2016 Christmas , which is peak season for delivering packages at United Parcel Service. No age discrimination there. I was 58 years old. You just have to work hard. Pay attention and work safely. I only have good things to say about this company"
good,"Very faced pace work, lifting boxes continuously throughout the night. Fun, laid back place to work. Manager is awesome would buy us breakfast every friday."

good,"physically demanding very important to stay hydrated. Great environment good workers. has good training, very good benefits. hard part is the hard labor."
good,"The job is pretty simple, deliver the custumers products safely and undamaged, with a smile, the hardest part of this job was the weather when it was icy or snowing was the worst other than that the job itsself was easy and enjoyable. All my co-workers were cool and the managers were great as well. Just a great job/company to work for"
good,Labor intensive fast pace work but always has a good team working with you. This company also takes real good care of you. And this company also gives you the opportunity to grow
good,"working for UPS was great , I had a good time and they have a knack for understanding Human Stress and Pressure and allow their employees time too heal . I when its and on the job stress , a person causing issues on the job its reconciled . Its turned over twice since I have been there , From Management to Peers"
good,Learn as much as you can about brokerage and logistics.  Review also air/ocean freight. Know what you salary expectations are and your goal you want achieve.
good,"I worked seasonal, drivers helper from Thanksgiving to New Years. WE organized and delivered packages, loaded packages from dock to truck.  Assisted the driver in finding those hard to locate addresses."
good,Great place to work if you want to meet people. Every day is different in the tasks you handle. Not just shipping but helping people with there business needs
good,"Enjoyed working for UPS.  Nice group of people, Job was temporary with no benefits.  Learned a lot while working for UPS.  Would not mind working for them again."
good,It takes a lot to work as a UPS employee. Not only will it demand physical labor but it will also demand decision making skills and the passion to get the job on time and protect everyone’s packages to the fullest.
good,Everyday you must be at the top of your game. 100% is barely enough to be successful at the end of the day. At least that was my experience and I worked there for ten years.
good,"Hard and fast paced work but good pay and benefits even for part timers. Pension for part time as well. Job security as it is a union job."
good,"Very fast and awesome work out hours are great , staff is great management is will to work with you if you have school or another job. Awesome benefits, especially for a part time job."
good,Retired after 33 years currently have a great pension. The benefits were outstanding and provided well for my family. Ups is an excellent company and I'm proud to say I worked there.
good,I can simply just show up punch in and get to work. Its awsome becasue I can just get things done. VERY fast paced environment so I hardly feel like I am at work for too long!! We hold daily meetings and get lunch bought when the shift has done a great job!
good,i love ups they way things are ran there. the only part about this job is the fact its super rough on your body.if i could stay there to retire i would .
good,"I like my job but not the hours we work relay relay in the morning but good pay great benifits ......."
good,"Worked twilight ramp and seasonal driver. There was something to be said for the satisfaction you felt after a days work and emptying your truck. Pay and benefits are great, but the work is tough and the days can be long, especially in peak season. But I fully recommend."
good,"As a supply chain management major, I enjoyed working as an assistant delivery driver. The work was active and it never got boring. Management was always very organized when planning routes and scheduling. Things were very busy during the Christmas season but I would definitely recommend this job."
good,it was okay but i would say if you don't like to stand for long periods of time this wouldn't be the job for you. otherwise i would say this is a wonderful place to work and benfits are a plus.
good,I'm not gonna lie everyday for the first week I wanted to quit but I stuck it out and got promoted to team leader after 8 months and that's when life gets much much easier. You turn into a supervisor and from that position the sky is the limit at ups. You just have to work hard and long there get your degree they have an excellent tuition assistance program and you'll be cruising. Only reason I had to leave was joining the Marine corps.
good,Very busy during the holidays enjoyed working for this company. Very good salaries and benefits. Part of the Union.i really. Don't have much else to say bit this  is a good business to work for.
good,I loved working with different drivers. Got to work with a few supervisors and they work just as hard as everyone else. I love the face paced environment. Loved organizing the back of the truck as well.
good,UPS is very fast pace because you are on the computer making and printing out labels for customers who want to ship products all over. The people you work with are awesome and very helpful in making sure you learn the system and know your regulars that come in the store.
good,"Good place to work at, you get paid to loose weight. The work day goes by fast. The supervisors are all very nice and will to help. They are good about showing that they care about you by taking safety very serious."
good,Good job to have if your unsure in what you want to do. Flexible hours and no uniform.  Work is simple but you have to use your legs and body. Part time or full time shifts available
good,"My position at UPS was a Driver Helper. Me and my driver had the same blocks each day. I got to interact with parents and there kids, along with there fur animals. But my job was to give people there packages or pick packages up. I learned how to interact with people more. But it all sounds easy, but at the end of each day you are in pain. From all the walking and bending and lifting for 8 to 12 hours each day. If you are in shape or you are dedicated to your job, you can work and do anything you want in life."
good,"Hard work, but fun to work at. Love the hours- I work the midnight shift part-time. It's like a military setting. Lots of the employees board the bus at Broad and Oregon en-route to the facility. Septa has special express buses to the facility."
good,I enjoyed the job and the extra Christmas money was great too. I had a great driver. Training only lasted a day. Easy application process. I lost weight and got paid to do it. No drug test and I didn't have to wait an extra week to get paid.
good,Great job for someone who wants to go to school and make extra cash on the side. They also work with your schedule. Have plenty of open spaces in either management or basic warehouse positions. You have room to grow either in management or in ware house positions.
good,Great work day there are times when you can can be at work waiting for pick up to continue your day but for the most part I had a good time with ups if was a good starting point to learn to drive 24 foot truck
good,"Working as a Driver Helper for the 2017 holiday season was physically demanding. However, my driver made it both challenging and fun. We worked as a team, and he let me know he appreciated my help. We remain friends even as I've moved on to other employment."
good,"I over loved my job, especially when it came to dealing with ups employees. I worked there during my breaks from school. my supervisor was overall very understanding when I told her i had to return back to school and offered me a position that I could always come back to in order to make money."
good,"A typical day as a driver for ups:"
good,"Was able to be independent and work at my own set pace while feeling very productive. Being on a truck was very liberating and low stress, not being stuck in a building was very enjoyable. Fresh air was great and being out in the winter weather was not an issue."
good,"Flexible work schedule, great employer and co workers. Hard part about is that you may get very busy while you are working by yourself. Very laid back job,"
good,"You’re always working out with all the boxes that you have to move. It’s good workout & good hours, I would recommend it you’re really motivated to do a lot of movement."
good,"I worked overnight loading and unloading trucks containing packages for delivery. There was a lot of movement and lifting of boxes, you get in great shape."
good,You have to be fast on your feet and deliver and pickup  packages in a timely manner. A typical day could be 8 to 12 hours to include Saturdays.  The hardest part of the job is when you have lifted big packages to deliver and no one is there to accept or sign for the items.
good,"It was a great place to work, loved the people on the job and people o worked with. I was so happy to work with UPS it was aan amazing time, I can't wait to be a driver helper again."
good,"As a loader and unloader, the job wasn't very stressful but it was fast-paced and you were expected to perform at a certain level. As a supervisor, the stress level is much higher based on the fact that you have to deal with demands from upper management while trying to ensure safety and good service numbers for the customers and part time employees."
good,"Work hard and you'll do well. UPS has amazing compensation packages for part-time workers. Go to college, work part time, get almost full time pay and excellent medical care and scholarship opportunities."
good,"It gave me a set of targets to reach my goals. The United Parcel Services offered a lot of teamwork. I am suggesting to anyone -- try it out! Whether its short term or long, it had to be my best experience."
good,"After getting truck loaded and paper work for day you are on your way for delivering and picking up freight..I learned to be fast paced while being safe with a truck.The management at the time I worked there was good.It also was a very good work culture there. The hardest part of job was getting all delivery's and pick ups done by end of day, while most enjoyable part was meeting different people every day."
good,every morning i would unload trucks and seperate packages. once that was done i get on the road and deliver packages to residental and commercial buldings.
good,"My experience at UPS was great even though it was not necessarily the easiest job, I was compensated well enough for the time I was there. A typical day at work consisted of myself meeting up with a driver who would then take me on his assigned route in which I would assist him in delivering packages to local businesses and residents. I learned a lot about the many rewards of hard work and how the supply chain from the package to the warehouse to the final customer was executed. The culture was positive and the driver's attitude about his job was up-lifting. The hardest part of the job was probably the physical exhaustion from a day's work of lifting packages and having to move at a very fast pace in order to ensure all customers got their packages for the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was my personal driver who was extremely friendly and easy to get along with."
good,"I truly love working for this company. The management  team was great , the atmosphere outstanding.  I have learned so much in such short time , how to communicate with others in a positive way."
good,"fast pace, hard work and achieving company goals is highly commanded. Your goals have to  be focus and clear. The atmosphere is loud and noisy and you have to be patient."
good,"Its a very stressful and dynamic work, dealing with unions employees.  "
good,"Flexible scheduling. Great for students, getting a leg up in retail management or printing. Competitive pay and incentives for employees who stick around."
good,Working as a driver helper was interesting and learned a lot from my driver such as locations and the area of delivery.
good,"Fast paced and long hours excellent management, Had to deal with employees as well as customers. Excellent recognition for both hourly and management employees."
good,Great way to add income around Christmas time.  Great company to work with. Managers were very good.  All employees were extremely helpful and friendly.
good,"By far the most intense job I've ever performed. Work was constant movement and thinking about how to properly load/unload trucks without damaging the contents. Many items were immensely heavy and required teamwork/help, which everyone was willing to give. The pay was great and the benefits are still to this day unmatched. I would recommend UPS to anyone who asked."
good,report to work at 330 am. Determine if work level requires addition routes. Add or remove work from routes to control drivers paid work day. Create dispatch plan for following days. determine staffing levels during holiday and vacation seasons.
good,"I enjoy my experience, co-workers and work environment. However, my desire is to work a full time job within office hours of 8 am - 6 pm. I have been with UPS for seven years and have learned a lot about the company."
good,"Excellent customer service, friendly, good with payroll."
good,"It was a great place to be, I loved the environment, the fast pace of the entire organization while still making sure their employees where doing okay was great as well."
good,Great Job. They will work with your hours. Management has your back if your a hard worker. The people you work with are positive and the clients are predominately nice to deal with too.
good,You get to ups facility and check your truck make sure you all next day air is loaded in truck. It’s a fast pace on the go job that’s why I liked it. Managers  and supervisor were great  always helping out.
good,"As an intern you will learn the ropes of the position they feel is best for you. If you excel at something else then you will likely be moved to another team. Generous and flexible work hours, and the lower levels of management know exactly what's going on and how to answer any questions you have."
good,I feel as though I could work for them again I loved working there I loved the management there they are very well organized and they a very stress free work environment if I didn’t need a full time job I would’ve stayed
good,"Working with UPS was a breath of fresh air after being at a call center. The work was typically very steady, although picked up pretty quickly during peak season. Everyone was a lot of fun to work with and management was easy to talk to and personable."
good,"I met a lot of nice people there, and the typical day at work was slightly stressful, but worth it. My manager was also very nice, and the people working with me didn't mind helping me out on the first day."
good,Everyone is very helpfull during training and coworkers are great to work with. This was a part time seasonal position I am greatful for the chance to work for ups.
good,Great job managers work with your schedule and offer you a variety of benefits. Work place environment is great and your coworkers will help you if you need help no matter what .
good,I was a driver's helper with ups for 3 months it was one of the best jobs i ever had i loved it but it was temporary sadly. I was in charge of delivering packages to a certain route while in a golf cart if was very demanding but once i got the route it was amazing.
good,"Very busy, fast-paced environment.  Time goes by fast.  Management is easy to work with.  Co-workers are friendly and hard-working.  People work together well."
good,"awesome experience!"
good,Ups was a wonderful place to work. You get to visit different neighborhoods. It was very fast paced to get everything out by a certain time but its great hard back busting work.
good,I've been at UPS over 13 years. benefits are great. Working environment is great and safe. They offer more hours often. Only complaint I have is they should have more full time jobs for the hard workers that deserve it.
good,UPS is a very productive and people-based company. I had no complaints nor disagreements with anyone or anything. Id come back to work anytime of the year.
good,"i would love to keep working for ups, everyone i met was so nice and helpful. im a little person and the job was too vigorous for me but it was still fast paced and fun. i wish they had more full time positions open"
good,"love my job not leaving till retirement . great benefits , good pay raises . great stock option and 401k . great bosses great employees . free uniforms"
good,"I really enjoy working at UPS.  The atmosphere is fun and fast paced.  "
good,The people seem to be friendly. The jobs that are at UPS are working with people and the public yet at the same time you are your own boss.  Once you leave the main branch and you go on your route you really don't interact much with other employees unless there is a problem.  Good place to work and feel productive with a sense of satisfying the community.
good,"* typical day was so fast paced that it was over s soon as it began"
good,"UPS was great place to work for if you only wanted to work about 25 hours a week, their benefits make up for this but is hard to raise a family on that amount if you are the only bread winner"
good,If u dont come to work dont work here its fast quick paste and have to get your work done but the bosses are very nice and understanding the benefits are great pay is good you could ask for nothing more!!
good,Nice place to work if you like a fast-paced environment.  Coworkers were great teamplayers.  Supervisors gave clear instructions and were available for questions.
good,"come in get started right away it was very quick paced, but great people to work with. overall great experience I learned to be quick and productive to have a great day and get packages out in a timely manner. made sure packages were not open if they were repackaged them also maintaining the belts as a belt tender. very multi-tasking job."
good,"If you are looking for a good benefit, fast paced and fun place to work, then UPS is your best choice. It's just you are expected to work long hours, typically from 9am to 7 or 8pm."
good,ups was a great place to work! you can always look up and try to further your career at this company. they will always make sure your safety is first! i love it !
good,I enjoyed my time at UPS. Met some good people. Learned a lot and worked very hard while I was there.  Would highly recommend working here and considered my time there as positive.
good,Fast paced and lots of work but it's good pay and lots of hours. Good management and everyone gets along well. They help you out with transportation and try their best to help you
good,"Out of the four jobs I have had UPS was the only one that showed how much they care about their employees. They always make sure your good, some of the calls can be overwhelming, and very stressful and UPS does what they can to help you relax and feel better."
good,"Great work ethic, they like to do their job well and quickly and they take serious pride in what they do. They taught me how to sort the trucks and use thePanDAS system."
good,Always got crazy’s towards the end of the night boxes would just pile up and sometimes smash you land on your feet sometimes just always bending and lifting barley even got. Ten min break
good,I started early in the morning loading the trucks.  I would then return later in the day to work the customer service desk if needed.  I also helped loading the packages out at the end of the day also if needed.  I enjoyed my time with UPS it was a part-time job that I took after the death of my mother to keep my self physically busy and it did that.
good,the company really cares about interns' experience. learned a lot about other departments' job through presentation. Opportunities to chat with the CFO and directors.
good,UPS pays well and the culture is easy going.It is hard physical work But at the same time traveling makes it very fun.The hours are not that consistent I still enjoy the work though.
good,fast working. lots to do but worth it. the hardest part is starting out because people who've been working there for a while move fast and you move off of there paste. it can be overwhelming at first. Good thing is they train you to be prepared and help you keep learning as you go.
good,"Employee's was great"
good,"The company is constantly changing, therefore the positions of employees constantly change. Competitively driven, it causes the company to push employees to strive for their best. Has really developed me as an engineer. You work until your job is done, but you are rewarded for good work."
good,UPS driver picked me up at 8am and we would work until we got that truck empty. He drove and I went to each door with packages. I learned how work super fast.
good,Learned how to work with people. Enjoyed meeting new costumers everyday. Very fast paced job. Days went fast. I really enjoyed my supervisor! Great workout everyday.
good,"by far the best job i have had, i do everything there.  I am the fill in guy, i am the one who knows most jobs in the building, the supervisors come to me for insight, And I always go above and beyond my job"
good,"very fast paced and can be a stressful environment. But they offer great benefits, with weekly pay. The hardest part of the job is when there is no air flow in the summer and no heat in the winter.  The weekly pay is great"
good,"Assist driver in deliveries and pick ups during the holiday season."
good,It’s a fast past job it’s fun but hard work it’s great if you want to get a 4 hour work out in! I had a great experience working there just not enough hours
good,Able to assist customers with billing and shipping issues. Enjoyed resolving issues and correcting billing issues. Great management and advancement opportunities.
good,It is a good job to have. A typical day at work is like any other warehouse job. Either really hot or really cold depending of the season. If you can keep up it is a great starting point for a career.
good,"Great working environment, ok pay for a temp job. My diver Allen is still a close friend of mine. I'd work there again for a seasonal gig. I can only wonder how it would be working full time"
good,I worked here for about 6 months of senior year of high school after my final football season ended. Great people to work with and you will not find lack of hours here.
good,"I worked as a package driver over the Christmas peak season. Absolutely loved it. I have nothing but good things to say about UPS. worked Monday thru Friday, no weekends. GREAT pay. Uniforms are very comfortable and made perfectly for UPS employees. They give you everything you need to be the best you can be. Including lots of training. I would do it again in a heart beat. If I had started with them when I was younger. I could be retired right now & still have time for another pension."
good,A great job with great pay and benefits. It's like going to the gym and getting paid for it. If you have a positive attitude and can keep your complaining to a minimum you'll be successful at UPS...
good,"Great place to work ,to advance . This is one of the better companies I've ever work for they treat everyone as family and great respect.The work is hard but enjoyable it's really helped me become a better person and help me increase my management skills"
good,UPS is by far the best job I've ever had. the management was very flexible and mature. i highly recommend making UPS a career life goal. i hope my children one day too work for ups.
good,Super fast paced. You have to be strong to lift most packages. I would pass out as soon as I got home just from how tired I was after each shift. It was a decent job though.
good,Wonderful place to work.. I had the opportunity to manage many departments..operations..finance....sales...customer service..call centers.'' industrial engineering.. and human resources.
good,"Meeting daily with my Supervisor's and Driver's, meeting the customers needs, running a on time network, customer visits, planing and development of new hires and training, hardest part of the job need meeting customer needs, making sure all empolyees are properly trained in the area and providing leadership and guidance."
good,"Overall a good place to work. Typical warehouse envoronment. Unionized with good pay, perks and benefits. They also promote within and the company is global."
good,"I love working alongside my father and brother at one of the best companies around"
good,"Good place to work. Need CDL to get fulltime opportunity. If you can secure a full time position, you can make a career out of your job. Management works with employees well."
good,I only worked at UPS on a temporary basis. I did it for two seasons. It is a decent paying job with a good aount of hours during peak season. The management was pretty good.
good,"Great company, start early work until job/task completed. Employees know what to expect on a daily basis.Leadership begins with you take care of your employees and customers and they will take care of you. Management takes responsibilities seriously. Enjoyed meeting customer understanding needs pulling teams together to identify issues create a plan and execute the plan"
good,Worked mostly evenings at a fast pace to get packages out to customers on time. Enjoyed working with my co-works as well. We always finished ahead of time and often help other lines out with their work.
good,"Although I was apart of a small team, communication with various departments is necessary. Management and managers are extremely approachable and make you feel heard. I am enjoyed my experience with them."
good,"Ups is an awesome place to work only thing ia the pay, needs to be higher for the type of work and heavy lifting, constant moving and movement , but over all a aweaome place to work friendly people and great staff"
good,I loved it. It was fast paced. The drivers you worked with were awesome. The hardest part is the constant fast paced if your not ready for moving that much it will suck.
good,"I loved working at UPS, because everyone were very helpful, and made you feel comfortable.I love the ""leave your attitude at home,"" rule. Its helps bring a more peaceful environment."
good,I work seasonal for UPS and I love the job and the co workers at the company I would love to have stayed but they didn't have a opening for truck driver.
good,What I enjoyed most about UPS was the learning experience and the driving. I am one person who loves to drive. If I had a chance to work there again I would love to take it.
good,I worked for this company for a year and advanced to management shortly after I started working. I am not sure that there are benefits offered. I would consider reapplying for this position.
good,Wish it was a longer shift ..overall I love fast pace working pay is great for the hours pt ...teamwork is awesome. .manager is cool. ..justy has to wait a year for insurance to start
good,UPS is the place for someone who enjoys a fast paced environment and never a stand still moment. The benefits with the company are amazing as well and progressive vacation packages.
good,"UPS is a wonderful company to work for if you are goal oriented. While your on the job, you must be self motivated and strive to be the best you can be and excel in all areas to be a long time successful employee. I remember the management taking care of anything we needed and the training was more than satisfactory."
good,The work environment is mostly relaxed and I learned the different procedures of importing shipments in the US. The management are fair and they are helpful managing you to meet your production mark.  The workplace culture is diverse and each employee respects one another. The hardest part of the job is when some of the shipments requires a lot of steps and procedures to process by you have to read a lot comments.  The most enjoyable part of the job UPS provides games and food for their employees when we meet our goals.
good,It was a very laid-back job I was able to work at my own pace and not over working myself that hours was very sufficent to my outside work life. It was also great benefits and overtime if needed.
good,Everyday was the same. Sorting out the package to the correct locations to be loaded on the other end. Everyone was great. You have some that just don't want to work. So the good workers got put in front or in the far back to caught all the packages that got missed.
good,Just do your job and you will be fine. Management is there to help you succeed and give you the tools you need to complete the job. Know your job title and so you know what you are responsible for.
good,"I really enjoyed working for UPS, the pay was good, the hours were consistent the co-workers were fun to know. It was like a family. some of the drivers who had close areas of delivery would meet for lunch every day, the customers were awesome, always happy to see us drive up to thier home.You were on your own in your delivery truck so it didn't feel like you had the boss looking over your shoulder."
good,Its a good place if you wantt goood benefits. The do basically eveertything to help you out if you got any problems.Also another good thing is that they have a union that you can join if you want.
good,Good place to work. A lot of benefits. You enter the union and receive benefits through the union.  It is fast- paced and can be competitive. There are a lot of opportunities to advance.
good,I learned a lot from working at ups. I learned a lot in different position I was put in and it was fun while it lasted. You learn on how to be responsible and communicate with a lot of people. Such as the people on the belt and the people in the loading trucks
good,"Después de trabajar unos tres meses en el almacén de la central de UPS en Maryland, como manipulador y conductor , mi valoración es muy positiva. Invierten mucho en formación y en medidas de seguridad e higiene. También tienes un horario flexible que puedes compaginar con estudios."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed joyed my job I started at age eighteen and continued to work there untill age 42 we're it started to affect my health and I realized it was time to move on ups was a good company to work for.to every thing there is a season a time to start and a time to end I miss my customers I always work at having my best repor with them I was the face of ups always want them to see the best I believe my customers like me and I surely like them
good,"I retired from UPS to be a caregiver full time for my mother,"
good,Good company to work for my functions was a route driver doing deliveries and pick up.  Air freight time sensitive products including hazmat material..
good,Fast pace job with need of sense of urgency and much needed paying attention to detail while abiding safe procedures to avoid any stress of the body and mind.
good,"Every day is different, that is the great thing about it.  You are expected to come up with solutions on your own and adapt to constantly changing conditions but it brings out the inner leader in you."
good,"I have to say that I absolutely love my job at the airport it can be cold, rain, sucks but nothing like working in and out of planes. and when you know your job you aren't bothered."
good,"A typical day at work would be fun and fast passed"
good,"Loved working at ups, got to experience something new and meet new people. It was fast paced and hard work at times but it was good. Loved experiencing new things"
good,I only left because I needed full-time employment and I would probably still be working there.  But promotions are highly based on seniority and after 5.5yrs I was still a good 3-4yrs from having full-time employment(may not be the same at your location).  Work is very fast paced and very physically demanding.  Peak seasons you will make a lot of overtime.  Pay and benefits very good and if you are willing to show you can go above and beyond you have the opportunity to make yourself valuable and have the chance to work extra to make more hours.  I almost worked full-time hours by getting trained on everything and volunteering for extra hours.  But I was working 6-7 days a week and split shifts.
good,"Es una excelente empresa para laborar, siempre con capacitación constante, cuidando siempre de tu integridad como persona."
good,"Ups working in the warehouse is a good work out , u get to work with a lot of funny people. When the season comes in its crazy as heck , hopefully if you do good may be a driver helper"
good,This is the best company in my whole call center career. They have the best salary and benefits as well as great security through retirement. Its just so sad to leave the company.
good,"The UPS Store was an absolute delight to work for! Management was fair and understanding. The customers were fantastic. There was always room for a learning opportunities. If you're the kind of person that likes the constant ""go-go-go"" while at work, this is the place for you!"
good,"Mentally this place helps me clear my mind. Also I can think a lot at this place, I can get away from the world and be in my own zone. Physically keeps me in shape, it helps me more than it hurts me working here."
good,I would recommend anyone to seek employment with this company I was very comfortable working for UPS and very happy with their benefits package 401k Medical Dental Optical pension and employees that are more treated like family then as Associates the best job I've ever had in my entire life is working at UPS here in San Antonio Texas I was happy to stay with the company for 13 years until my mother passed away from cancer I was devastated and resigned for bereavement
good,I enjoyed the exercise walking up and down driveways delivering packages. In the month of doing Temporary work I learned my whole neighborhood by street names and addresses.
good,you are given a good hours good pay and time off. the place s fast for boing and u have a lot of stress for packing the boxes in the right time frame.
good,"Job security."
good,"Ups is a very good company to work for, They give you room to grow and build, and the sky is the limit if you want to go up. All you have to do is to come to work, do a good job and the promotions will be there."
good,"Work environment is very good"
good,very physical and demanding job if you work in the warehouse  due to the weather elements can get really hot especially if your unloading the trucks and unloading heavy boxes
good,"Resume ups is  good compant mgmt etc "
good,"Hustling from start to finish, UPS has taught me time management skills, interpersonal skills and the ability to behave in a professional manner. The hardest part was keeping time during the holiday season where there seemed to be endless amounts of packages and next-day-air that needed to be delivered. The enjoyment involved was greeting customers and seeing the truck almost empty."
good,"Was only a seasonal driver helper, but it was a very enjoyable experience with possibility of advancement. The people were professional and kind and willing to give a helping hand in understanding of the processes involved. It was a great working atmosphere."
good,"Very adaptable place to work, everyone seems to listen what you have to say. Very good place to work your way up the ranks and they pay well. I worked night shift and had my school paid for. Awesome place to work!"
good,the company that good to work in. Hopefully i get the chance to work there again. Management (previous) do really take care about staffs welfare. benefits wise quite great.
good,"This is a physical, fast-paced position that involves continual lifting, lowering and sliding packages that typically weigh up to 25 - 75 lbs. Sort packages using the package tracer system. "
good,I worked here for a total of 5 years. I was laid off due to cutbacks in the company. The benefits were good. I learned a lot of new things while at this company.
good,if you like to ride around making deliveries in your neighborhood its a great job. you meet a lot of people and become a active member of the community.
good,"Good Company, very physically demanding. The management can be better. There is definitely a division between management and non management. The benefit are great for a family."
good,"Learned basic Quickbook operations  "
good,"Enjoyed coming to work everyday they offer overtime. Also, you have great co-workers that help make the job easier because everyone works as a team to get the job done. I would work for this company again."
good,"The company has great benefits, your in a union which has its own benefits. Although it is a fast paced and demanding job, its worth it. You are continually moving so the job gets you into shape, plus all the benefits...cant go wrong. I loved my time there !!"
good,if you are a college student looking for a part time job ups is the way to go. ups has a college program which pays for your classes while working for them.
good,Can't fault the job role but as for the management how it's run I can't find words to describe how bad they are. I have no problem with the company themselves it's just how it's run.
good,"overall the environment and the people are a plus, supervisors from co-workers are super cool in a way that everyone wants to extend a hand in terms of helping you out. In the beginning it just was difficult to adjust to the time difference getting into the night shifts, but everything else played along well."
good,"Great place to work, and the management at this store (independently owned and operated franchise) always took care of their employees. The customers are amazing and always enjoyed chatting with my regulars."
good,I really enjoy working for Ups its a great place to work. I learn so many new things such as how to navigate many systems and how to become a team player.
good,Made pickups and deliveries on a daily basis. Learn to interact with customers on a daily basis. Worked under a good management team. Good teamwork. Good work ethic
good,my typical day at work is making sure  all my team are up to date with there task. I make sure everybody is enjoying there day and ends with a smile on there face. The most enjoyable part of my day is knowing that every team member is treated with respect and are happy.
good,"For a typical day at work you have to be mentally and physically prepared. Constant moving and thinking, lifting and lowering. It is definitely a skilled job. You have to have a great attitude to get through as well as endurance. A usual day you load about a thousand packages in 4.5 hours. Some areas are heavier than other. I have learned patience, organization, endurance, pace, and perseverance. Management has always been helpful in training and feedback. And doing their best to accommodate our needs.In our workplace, everyone is like a big family. Showing care for each other watching out for the safety of each other, helping each other out when backed up, teaching each other more effective methods. The hardest part of the job is persevering through a heavy day; sometimes it feels like the boxes never stop coming, or when the truck is manifested with more boxes than it should. A positive attitude is important! The most enjoyable part of the job is after you've completed an entire load, it's like your masterpiece. All loading techniques differ. Also the benefits and weekly pay!"
good,basic day to day office work with fun coworkers. management are great and kind. Days can be long at times but for the most part time do fly. Vacation could be longer.
good,"I liked the fact that you have a daily schedule in which you know your hours you know who you'll be working with along aside the driver. my drive was very nice and told me the do's and dont's of the job which helped a lot. The most fun I had was riding in the truck and knowing the importance of my job in which securing and delivering packages to them it made me feel worthy of my time. The job works you hard but it also puts your body in good physical and mental shape which is good if you love food, I loved being dedicated and on time and had good relationships with co workers while getting my job done,"
good,"Loved the work. I was sad when it ended, I was getting used to the route and the people. I liked driving the go cart and the rout was a new territory for me. Exploring new places."
good,"every year I come back because I love this job. its like another home for me. The people and the atmosphere is that of a tight knit, hard working atmosphere."
good,I enjoy working here because i feel as if i am making a contribution to this major company. Safety is always #1 here and they will train you on safety techniques and it is a fun place to work.
good,It was a very very fast paced job especially through the Holidays.  It was good because most of the people were easy to get along with and work with.  It was a really good job.
good,I loved working here I will return at any time they may need me. The hours we're phenomenal but only thing was if u needed to call out there was nobody to call because u work from 3-9 am. I was supposed to be a package handler but when I came in they immediately put me on a conveyor belt because I was fast paced.
good,"I enjoy working here because it is very physically challenging. I also have another job, so working part time hours here is very manageable for me and my family."
good,"They work a way a company should work, they take care of their employees and do there best to compensate everyone while still running an effective machine."
good,Ups was kinda easy Street for me. Very easy. I learn things fast. Boxing boxes doing shipping and receiving when that's what I already do at my job. Everybody got on the same track and work as a team. I learned a lot there
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, siendo una de las empresas líderes en small package."
good,"When I started working seasonal at Ups 3 years ago, and they were vary gracious to keep me on I'v learned. Being that UPS was one of my first jobs I was new to a lot. I wasn't quite sure how rough my job was going to be first starting out, but with the help of UPS they put you through their comprehensive training program, and they will teach you everything you need to know. It will all became second nature and the manual labor will became nothing. It's all a very easy job after a little while."
good,Brokerage operation for UPS Truckload shipments. Great place to work. Career advancements. Life balance corporation. I enjoyed working for UPS. Friendly work atmosphere.
good,A lot of the time you're working by yourself and getting the job done based on your own abilities throughout a 6 hour part time shift. Although you're working by yourself majority of the time you need to stay aware of your surroundings to make sure that you don't injure anyone or kill anyone with your 5 ton forklift.
good,The owners of the UPS Store were the best you could ask for. They were fair and considerate. Anytime you needed a break or if you needed to go home for an emergency they always accommodated.
good,UPS is a great employer. They are innovative and always forward thinking.  Advancement opportunities and job security. They are leaders in their industry.
good,"Though i was only with UPS for a short time, I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. UPS is an amazing place to work. I learned so much about the schedules and time management. Hardest part of the job was rushing to get packages out as soon as possible. Everything was enjoyable at UPS."
good,"In the time I have spent there, it has been a good experience. I'm glad that I'm still there. I would suggest this job. I do get a good work out doing the job"
good,"everyday was like clock work, got good exercise walking from door to door.  Simple training,  good teammates and customers; only thing to worry about wore the dogs...."

good,"It's fun & enjoyable at work place,"
good,"I only worked for 2 months before I was granted the title Print Manager. Great place to work. I loved the managers, and the job was definitely challenging. The only problem was the pay. Not too fantastic for the stress you get."
good,"As an hourly apart of the union, I received amazing benefits and compensation. My coworkers were amazing and I made many good friends at this company. I made my mistake when I went into management. I lost my guaranteed raises, my benefits weren't nearly as good, and I didn't have a degree and was not able to advance, no matter how well I performed."
good,There is alot of activity and physically demanding tasks. It's a great place to work with many opportunities for advancement. However it would be great to build time off based on hours until you've worked there long enough to obtain sick days and PTO.
good,"If you can handle a physical short 4 hour shifts Monday through Friday I think you'll love working at UPS. Best co workers I've ever been with everyone just wants to get the sort done right and as soon as possible. I like being around those types of people, Supervisors care and want to help with anything and everything."
good,The preload position at UPS north Charleston is the definition of controlled chaos. It's physically demanding and the hours can take some getting used to. I still enjoyed my time there.
good,stay productive and there are no issues i enjoyed working with my co-workers each day. i didn't work here long. it was a seasonal job helping out for the holidays. since i worked on a truck and not the warehouse i wasn't offered a permanent position.
good,"I enjoyed helping temp during Christmas season, I was one of the last ones to be let go due to my quality of work."
good,"Great company to work for. they provided flexible hours, and great people to work with . they had good Holidays off time and paid overtime, they I had good supervisor and all my jobs"
good,"UPS was a job I actually looked forward to going to each day. The only downsides were it was night shift and there was not any full-time advancement for me (seniority) for the next 5-7 years."
good,My position as an intake agent included answering the phones talking to UPS employees and providers regarding worker compensation issues or redirecting the employee to the correct department to which they should be speaking.  The main responsibility of my job consisted of attaching supporting medical documents to the employees' file that would medically support their on the job injury/illness.
good,Absolutely love my job the only downside is there are no benefits for retirement. The owner is amazing and is very easy to work for and is very flexible with schedule to accomadate my family.
good,"The Best Union Job As for asDriveing in jax. Fla."
good,"Ups is a great job to have the people are great management is awesome. Ups has so much room for growth the benefits are great also, they also pay for school they are so big on education I love that."
good,UPS is a company that cares about their employees and believe in allowing them to progress and move up within the company. From working at UPS I have grown and sharpened my skills and abilities.
good,Worked at a franchise. Owner was great! The pay became competitive when I became a manager but for a franchise it was not terrible for entry level positions either.
good,working at ups was great its good benefits and good pay. its a career more than a job its something that you can do for the rest of your life and is a job thats worth it.
good,"Great company to work for if you can be chosen for fulltime employment.  Very hard work as a loader in mornings especially during seasonal months, but reward for it if you are kept on is a potential career with a company that has a great  reputation and takes care of its workers."
good,I very much enjoyed the work opportunity i was given with UPS . The management was responsive and helpful to all employee needs even though there was at times pressure to meet delivery quota at times i savored the concept that even routes were pre- planned it allowed the driver options to make decisions based on importance of deliveries to be performed within time guidelines . They offered incredible advancement opportunities according to work performance .
good,Coming into work at ups is great. First and most important objective i learn at ups is saftey. How to use the proper position to lift up a package. The warehouse associates are helpful if you find yourself needing help. I enjoy how they give you the opportunity to go to school and pursue you goals
good,"This job is a typical delivery job and quite laborious, but it comes with a lot of integrity and compassion. being able to deliver face to face with people is very rewarding and allows you to know well the environment of your work and tests your abilities as a responsible & friendly employee. The main quirks about it really depend on your expectations of the job. If you expect your driver to have you only do the simplest job, than you'll be disappointed, they will handle you with trust and care as long as you do your part in delivering. Perhaps my own personal concern was with management. Several times did I have to ask for my checks that came 3 weeks late since my arrival, even when being asked to work over-time management always eluded my calls. Depending on management orders also came down to having them fix my schedule, and a majority of the times they had poor skills in communicating properly to the employee when you'll work, what time, and how long. Despite the bad I learned a lot from this job and it refined my skills in customer service, and that's always handy."
good,I was able to learn about wraping packages . Rewraping packages and sorting packages. UPS was a great working enviornment. I was able to learn ablout package handling
good,It's a very labor intensive job but if you are going to make a career out of ups the benefits and pay are well worth it in the long run. The driver jobs are well worth the years of physical labor.
good,"Always use load safety rules , and make sure you remember the loading numbers and be carful with hazards . Always bend your knees and keep a loading crate for spaces you can't reach , always load from bottom to top with no spaces ."
good,"I liked the supervisors.  and the others I worked along side.The scanner worked perfectly to keep form loading packages onto the wrong package car.  I also liked the security check-in.  They also have good college reimbursement plans available,"
good,Great place to work very family orientated good benefits nice work place and overall a great job to have management team are very nice and are also willing to work with you when you need
good,"Great work environment, amazing benefits, good management team, fun work environment, amazing team work and effort, a corporation to have a career for life"
good,Ups is well desiard workplace very put together not messy everyone was a big help supervisors are very relying and organized workplace this job was a temporary job but i loved ot also
good,"Great company to work for, they hire from within, very good pay, management is easy to talk too.  The benefits are better than any other job I have had, and I worked for the State for 20 years."
good,"My typical day at work consist of processing spinal kits and picking orders. I enjoy working for UPS but am ready or a new challenge. There is nothing hard about this job.  My most enjoyable part of my job is the work itself.  My workplace culture is making sure that all kits are processed correct and ready to be shipped out,"
good,"I am a believer that a workplace should be always a fun place and a consistence team work. we can all gather ideas to make some improvements and achieve our goals on our best way. Work should be always respect in terms of timing and goals. Depending on job versus position we need to make sure we are organized in terms on what kind of attention it need, for e.g. if its a customer focus position , prioritize the customer and their needs and queries."
good,The job was really easy I had a great driver who was very knowledgeable and helpful the job went by fast and had a blast doing it I will be applying again to work for them
good,"UPS is an exciting place to work at and very rewarding. Christmas rush is the best time to work for the company, as hours double and over-time is good.  Workers are positive and benefits are good. Family time is great along with promotion opportunities."
good,UPS was a very great company to work for. everyone i had met was very nice and responsible. My boss constantly made sure i was ok and had what i needed. gave $200 bonuses a week
good,Teaches the employee work skills treats there employees with respect good supervisors and mangers and other employers. Vary diverse and I relocated an the distance was not helping. Coming into work working with employees that show you respect and cares and understands some of the outside problems you my have.
good,Like i said great place to work. You pretty much can pick and choose what position you want in the company. Management was awesome. Its like a fine tuned machine how everything works.
good,"Fast pace, Quick Learning, Great Directions. working with others to get a great review of the job. Training individuals to reach their full potential"
good,"Great place to work long term. It's unionized. Annual raises. There is a huge opportunity to move up, and make UPS a career. Can't beat the benefits. Physically hard."

good,"great opportunity for advancement, and excellent benefits.   Tuition reimbursement opportunity to better yourself."
good,Very good work place. Great staff. Management as well. Made you feel bloke a team or even family. Definitely would go back.
good,"very fast pace, strict attendance, but overall a great company to work for. I started learning different aspects about the job as soon as I walked in the door. You have to stay on point at all times, but if you like labor intensive work as I do then your in the right place, I suppose the hardest part of the job would be dealing with the elements, though it is indoors but no heat or A/C."
good,learning the job i enjoyed being train by person that train me to do the job well and to catch on to as the trainer had to walk off to help another person and i was able to the job on my on without him watching i did a great job my own and beside from i liked the work

good,Working at The UPS Store you meet a lot of regular customers. The work environment is laid back and the management is extremely helpful with trying to make your schedule work with home life. Definitely one of the best places I have worked at.
good,"I loved each position I learned  At first I was an early morning truck unloader, just emptied the trucks   Later I worked on the line loading the trucks based on the addressed packages and finally I delivered early morning next day Air packages which had to be there by  10 AM"
good,it okay if in it for the long run. pay is good but I wish they had full time employment. on the other hand it has great benafites and the pay is okay for the work you do.
good,this place was great the way that they have the opprtunity for advancement was remarkable they helped us out alot with jobs job security an a great work enviorment
good,"Picked, Packed and shipped orders for customers. Fast paced environment with attention to detail. Worked lots of overtime to provide excellent customer service."

good,"Everything about this company was great, good pay, good benefits, good pension, good vacation package. If you don't mind physical work and hard work its a great place to work."
good,There isn't much I can say about United Parcel Service. Only being there for 6 Months. I can tell you it is a highly physical job. Do not take this job if you expect to be lazy. They ensure you are trained correctly and it is always a safe work environment.
good,the job is hard and demanding meanwhile the environment can be dirty and cause sickness'. the sanitation does fix it slightly. Everyone is trying to work towards the same goal and make the job better as it all goes. nothing goes truly missing and everything goes through the system as it should as the workers do everything they can to maintain the workload
good,Fast pace job with plenty of advancement opportunities. Opportunity to start from the bottom and work your way to the top. There are amazing benefits for all employees and their families.

There are so many opportunities and they want you to succeed inside of UPS and outside of UPS. But to me, the job isn't worth it if you're not in school because everyone starts off with the same pay wether you're in school or not. The wages could increase some, but still overall the company is fantastic and it's great to know that the company has your back and wants you to succeed."

You might get lucky very lucky seniority is always going to be first over experience they don't care if you have 5 to 10 years experience as whatever it is you were doing before is a union they promote withing and seniority will always beat any experience you have. Is hard work lifting and lowering constantly, heavy to lightweight boxes and no there is no GPS on the trucks you have to learn the routes. it does suck at first because if there's no work they send you home I applied during peak season there's was so much work sometimes you wished you were being sent home but the  pay check is well worth it"

good,"A typical day would begin with pre-shift meeting where we would be assigned our stations on the belt. We would also stretch and go through the safety tip of the day. Once the belt started it rarely stopped, which I enjoyed because it was very fast paced (particularly in peak season). There were to many supervisors for what needed to be done, but that is mostly because UPS is an unionized company and the supervisors were not allowed to work unless asked to by an employee. There seemed to have high turnover so plenty of chances for advancement."
good,UPS is a fast paced environment that challenges the mind and body. there is a finite amount of time it takes to get our job done.
good,I liked going in at UPS sorting packages and scanning packages and stacking them from bottom to top. I learned the zip codes for most cities and states .Most of my coworkers were team players.

good,fun and enjoyable work place. fast paced warehouse environment with little downtime. must unload trucks of boxes or irregular packages at a fast pace 1500 too 2000 pph ( packages per hour) so many workers theres not allways enough  overtime to go around if you need it.
good,They have a no nonsense attitude but still show a friendly vibe.
good,Supervised employees unloading/loading various vehicles to transport packages to other hubs. Very strict almost military style management which has its ups and downs. Great potential to make UPS a career with room to advance in any part of the business you desire.

Management was so understanding at times they harsh but i know they were just teaching me the right things. My co worker was hard as worker as myself always worked together to make sure we did everything right. The hardest part learning everything in a short period of time and not to make any mistakes. The most enjoyable part was i was able to talk to my boss about anything i felt safe even treated me to lunch sometimes always put my family first appointments and my school and i was able to trust them like family.
good,"This company was great to work for, excellent benefits and compensations.  management was quick to fix issues that deal business."
good,Package handle on daily loading trucks .It teaches you how to keep things in order.Supervisors are ok some co-workers are hard workers The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the flow.Best part is win you loaded your truck with 0 missloads!!!!
good,"UPS is a great company to work for.  They abide by a ""promote from within"" philosophy.  This helps ensure that the people that move upward are familiar with how the UPS culture works.  It makes good business sense and develops a solid work ethic for the individual.  "
good,"Arrive on job, receive flight and work sheet for your shift. Go to your crew for that shift, wait for sup. then wait for planes to land and unload or load the plane to the warehouse."
good,"A typical day at work is loading/unloading packages and interacting with your co-workers and supervisors. Management and co-worker help each other develop their skills and place where they will be very effective. Hardest part of the job would be lifting heavy boxes in a fast pace environment, and the most enjoyable part of the job would be the co-worker and supervisors."
good,I gained valuable experience working at UPS. I quickly became the go to person on getting the yard ready on Sunday night work.
good,"Clean, care for owners property and health care assistance for owners."
good,"is a fast paced job"
good,"Je suis très ravisant d'exercer ce travail avec assiduité, ponctualité, beaucoup de respect, esprit d'équipe et le travail en groupe."
good,"There are few companies I have worked for that offer the sense of family at UPS. Nearly everyone I worked was pleasant, always ready to lend a helping hand. The hours were long, yet fulfilling. There was never a question that went unanswered by a superior, and a supervisor was never hard to find. While the physical aspects of the job were demanding, they were also some of the best of what the job had to offer."
good,It was a great summer job.Get an good opportunity to take care of different types of fruits. It help me build a sense of opening own grocery store in future.
good,"I learned something new almost every day about the job, the company and about people in general. The hardest part of the job was doing repetitive tasks which were not challenging. The most enjoyable part of the job was adding new hardware systems, doing all the work including the software changes and feeling like you truly accomplished something when it was done!"
good,work you harder and the pay was bad and little.the conditions varies
good,"The best day of work when they tell me I have the task of auto transport to other states,increased order and my responsibility is abide by the rules and regulations of traffic, usually I put in my calculations to arrive early to place my work and inspect the car before I drove it and getting the instructions carefully so that I can be implemented to the fullest, I am on a good relationship with my co-workers and I have had their bonds of respect, the hardest part of my job is when the day is as busy as can be time consuming and boring, the best part of my work while the work is ongoing and varied and renewed ."
good,Working at UPS is a great opportunity. I have had the chance to be trained in multiple areas & they provide great benefits. Its does take a long time to advance to full time positions but considering the benefits for hourly employees it equals out.
good,we start are day off by stretching and having a group meeting. trained to be the safest driver on the road. everyone at the job is vary helpful and great attitudes. the hardest part i would say would be when your loader messes up your load. and the best part is getting to drive those trucks.
good,"Ups Store. What i did was packaging and shipping, and also rented mail boxes. I managed the store when owner wasn't in. I did scheduling, payroll, and also kept count of inventory. Handled ordering for all packaging equipment necessary."
good,packed shipped drugs daily very nice place to work standing most of your shift
good,This job was cool because you felt the burn from the workout in loading 1600 packages per truck. I learned how to work exceptionally fast and accurate all at once. the hardest part of this job was having loaded the whole semi then having to crawl and dig our way back to the beginning to find a package that our boss intentionally misloaded to see if we'd catch it. The best part in working at UPS was that there was always some kind of contest going on. I Won a 60 inch Flatscreen!
good,It was a great experience especially working through the holidays.
good,Building rapport with managers and team mates.  Working together to accomplish the mission of effective customer service.
good,This was a tough job but helped to shape me into a better worker.The money and benefits was great for a student.It was well organized.

good,The company exercise new core commitments by meeting every month to address new ideas.
good,Created reports on the weekly basis for the required project to meet the necessary requirements of the project.
good,A very fast-paced work environment where everything is always moving and if you have to keep up if you don't want to get left behind. It was intense as you daily had to meet deadlines and quotas. The people were the best part of the job and made every day working there manageable.
good,Job was awesome and company was awesome however the management team needed work.
good,"I've been with the company for nearing 10 years. I've learned a little of everything. Unfortunately, our management team is young, and usually hired right off of the street with absolutely no knowledge of UPS operations. I have no problem chiming in my 2 cents (respectively), if that's what it takes to get the job done the right way, safely, and efficiently. I thoroughly enjoy my co-workers."
good,"I would usually load four trucks a day with around 1,000 packages in each truck for delivery everyday.  During the Christmas season I would have five trucks with about 1,500 packages per truck.  The job was fast paced, because the trucks needed to be loaded and ready before the drivers could leave for delivery."
good,"I must say that this was the most physically demanding jobs, but i loved it. I worked with different personalities everyday. It was an active shift everyday."
good,Part-time work consists of scanning packages and sorting in the UPS hub.  Hardest part of the job was the lack of heating and air.  I enjoyed the job incentives and rapid paced work environment.
good,"I go to work at 1:30 p.m. I then pre-trip my tractor.  I put together my two trailers and dolly.  I then pre-trip my set and usually leave the Spokane facility around 2 p.m.  I drive to Hermiston, OR which takes around 3 hours and 15 minutes.  I post-trip my trailers and dolly and put them in the outbound lanes for continued travel.  I then eat lunch and take a break before doing a trailer and dolly inspection for my return trip to Spokane.  I usually leave around 6:30 p.m.  I usually get back to Spokane around 9:45.  I then post-trip my set and put the trailers on unload doors and put away my dolly.  I post-trip and fuel my tractor.  Usually get done around 10:30 p.m.  "
good,"I loved working for this company, the work is hard but the pay and the benefits are great. And they teach there employee how to become a good leader."
good,"It is hard work, and the conditions or either hot or cold 8/12 months. If you are able to and tolerate part-time hours and a slow but steady wage increases, UPS pays off. The wait for full time is 6-8 years. I am optimistic that it will be worth the wait."
good,I answer calls and help customers process their payments online. Its a very good job with great benefits.
good,"I really enjoy working at UPS every night it was something different going on I learned how important it was for me to load the truck properly overall I found it most difficult stacking those boxes making sure they don""t fall"
good,A typical day at work would be driving around looking for apartments and homes to drop packages off. My co-workers were really fun to be around. The hardest part of my job was trying to find apartments at night time when my eye sight is not that great. The most enjoyable part about my job was when I was able to find apartments and drop the packages off.
good,"Walk in, clock in, go to my work position area, start working hard the entire time until all boxes are loaded, packed, returned, or reshipped, then clock out and return next day. i learned what distribution companies are really about. Good management team along with okay communication between supervisors and workers. co-workers all seem to enjoy their job somewhat, i think because of the fast pace along with okay pay, and communication. The hardest part of the job is filling out paperwork while staying focused on communication between others for safety and to know all packages are being delivered correctly. The most enjoyable part of the job is shooting the bull with management team in between meetings and breaks, you get to know the person a little bit better than outside of work."
good,Great place to work. Amazing environment and okay pay. I only worked as a part time packing professional and customer service representative but I loved my time at the UPS Store.
good,"On a typical day at UPS I would have to preform multiple task, such as order picking while operating a cherry picker. I learned valuable management and warehouse skills. Management seemed to be reliable, with care for their employees. some of my co workers worked in coordination but some people were not with the production marker. The hardest part of the job was to achieve a higher production mark while operating a powered industrial truck in a confined proximity. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning a new technique."
good,"If you are an hourly, you can expect hard, physical labor for a decent wage, very good benefits, and protection provided by the local Teamsters. If you are in management, you can expect rigid, no-excuse production standards, slightly worse benefits than hourly's, and potential grief due to the presence of the labor union. BUT, as a supervisor, if you can withstand all that, this job will make you a superstar for any other management position out there."
good,"Going through a routine with procedures and safe work methods."
good,UPS Store is a friendly work place also i would recommend anyone to work there!
good,"entregar mensajeria puerta por puerta ."
good,A typical day at UPS provide goals for the current day and learn how to execute the goal in the time provided. the most enjoyable part of my job is accomplishing every goal.
good,The fist job of the day is to set up wich only should take about 10 minutes to accomplish. wWe start off the day with saftey tips and information of the amount of packages we are expecting to recieve and ship out of the warehouse. we are then designated to our positions and use our experience that we have learned to make sure that everything ships out on time. everyone is friendly and hard workers.
good,"Very fast paced work environment, great benefits and job security. Must be able to multi-task like never before otherwise its possible to drown. Otherwise awesome opportunities await with UPS"
good,Enjoyed meeting the Customers and giving them wwoderful customer service.

good,"Has one of the best management that I have worked for, the environment is relaxed, safe and fun."
good,"Distribuição de mercadorias em lisboa ou arredores."
good,"Wonderful place to work."
good,"Working for a global company was great. Logistics is what this company is all about, along with providing superior customer service. Management was great, they were always there when needed. I learned to track and redirect packages, which I was able to use these skills at my next job. The best part of this job was servicing the customers, delivering packages and receiving smiles made the work day enjoyable. With very heavy boxes to move sometimes made the job physically stressful."
good,"Typically my job is fast paced, and physically demanding. I enjoy it, however. My co-workers and I process incoming packages and move them to corresponding conveyor belts to make sure the packages get to the proper destination, without mistakes. We average 43,000 volume per day. Management is very nice and understandable for the most part, they can be hard, but they do have a schedule to maintain. The co-workers are amazing for the most part. There are a few hard-heads, naturally, but I digress. "
good,I would like to secure a permanent place within the UPS Company. A great place to work.
good,I loaded trucks and that was a hard job but its like working out for 5 hours and getting paid to do so
good,"Every day was different.  With the changing technology and changes in services offered, it was always a learning situation.  I enjoyed working with the drivers around me, we worked well together to face daily challenges brought on by the unknown.  Daily fluctuation in pickup volume meant we needed to cooperate well to provide the very best service to our customers."
good,A typical day begins with a warm employee greeting. Reports are read and interpreted by the time employees show up to their shift. Adjustments are made based on availability of workforce. Estimate and evaluate time the shift will end and act on possible problems which would be not getting done on time or having to cut routes on a moment's notice. Meet with fellow managers and plan for the remainder of the shift and next day's volume of work. Meet with internal customers and coordinate requests so that routes are delivered without service interruptions and as flawless as possible. The hardest part of my day is to try to please everyone at once; compromises have to be agreed upon. The enjoyment of putting a good dispatch and getting done on time safely above anything else is very pleasant.
good,I enjoyed package delivery but I was only a seasonal employee. If I was invited back I would give U.P.S. serious consideration.
good,This job I had a great time working for the company its self is amazing. The co workers i worked with are all cool and professional people. i was only working at ups for the season but it was a great experience and would love to come back and work full time.
good,"A typical workday involved delivering a variety of packages to various locations in the metropolitan Washington, DC area. The workday was never standard and the key to making each day productive was flexibility and patience. At UPS I learned that even indirect teamwork with all employees improved the efficacy of the corporation's mission. During my time at UPS I believe that the management was fair and diligent in their roles. My coworkers were reliable and shared any knowledge of the business with me at any time it was requested and otherwise. The hardest part of the day would have to be the unpredictable times that the shift would end, as there was never a set time the work day would end.  The most enjoyable part of the day would have to be every time a task or goal was completed. I take pride in and enjoy working and therefore documentation of the work I do is the best part of the job."
good,Great people to work along side. Fun place to work at. I get to work close to an aircraft.
good,Learned alot about how to be a team player.  The rewards and recognition were great.
good,The work is very physical and you definitely feel the elements since you work in a warehouse but once you make it into the union you have job security and after a year you get full medical coverage and a raise once a year. Also once in the union you're guaranteed three and a half hours of work a night. Work is five days a week.
good,"My typical day at UPS , I arrive at site at 12 a.m. during the early morning working with 7 men who drove for UPS for years decided to leave driving do mechanic work for package car driving. I also  research address for packages with incorrect address, make correction before packages goes through our hub to be sorted on package truck. I enjoy working with the guys and we make sure safety is first in whatever we do. This job is giving me an opportunity to supervise in the hub instead of working in the office. I carry on a different leadership skill that will help me grow."
good,treated with respect and fairness.nice place to work for and excellent career oppertunties.....
good,I was very proud to work at UPS. got to meet and work with a lot of great people.
good,i have enjoyed work in diffrent companys to anlyzing problems and i have learned more about product technologies.
good,"Typical day starts off by clearing the back room of anything that needs to be packed and I usually jump right into helping customers. I've learned a lot about printing, packaging and customer service and have had some really great coworkers as well as managers. The harder part of the job is when you are left alone and it gets extremely busy, there is a lot of multitasking that is required but we're always able to get the job done. It's very enjoyable working with my coworkers and we try to make it fun while at the same time getting everything done."
good,"Atendimento ao cliente (interno e externo) via telefone e recepção (inclusive estrangeiros) e auxilio em demais rotinas administrativas."
good,"Dispatching to eighty eight drivers daily on making pickups and delivering packages, sending address and phone numbers. Multiple line phone answering. Resolving service issues with customers and assisting customers in resolving delivery issues. Assigning routes to drivers and ordering center inventory."
good,"Although it is such a demanding job and fast paced, with little room for error, the training and managment support was spectacular. They were very understanding with any problems, and did their best to do whatever they could to keep the shift flowing smoothly. It was very rewarding in pay and benefits, although there was not a whole lot of hours. (15-20 weekly)"
good,"working at ups is not a walk  in the park ."
good,"UPS started as Border Brokerage when I began working in the brokerage field, the management took me under their wing and treated me like family. Working in brokerage with no experience can be very difficult yet learning within this company was made easy with the comfort. It was difficult to leave, but I needed to pursue a different company as I did not make enough and have a family to support."
good,"i love this job out of all jobs i've ever had"
good,"Probably the best thing about this company is the benefits. I had Medical, Dental and Vision. That's just unheard of nowadays. That all starts day one of employment, you don't have to wait for those benefits. I work at another big company now and the benefits aren't even close to this and I'm paying more. That's ridiculous. But over all it was a great experience working there but nothing can match those bene's.........."
good,"I flew cargo flights, both international and domestic. I learned to operate large aircraft on routes all over the world. The management was very good at providing excellent equipment and leadership. The pilots I flew with were excellent. Long flights were the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was flying with great people."
good,Even though this job was a lot of repetition I was content the job was hard at first because temperature was like warehouse temperatures. I learned how to work fast and efficient and how to lift properly. This place was pretty good at promotions. I wouldn't mind going back to work there but its part-time.
good,"As a recent high school graduate in can be hard to find a job, even harder to find a good job. UPS was a great experience for a first job. It allowed me to work with a great supervisor and learn to work more independently and have responsibility. A typical day included meeting my driver, delivering and picking up packages, and interacting with customers. Some days were especially long due to peak season but was still enjoyable."
good,"UPS Autogistics was a great place to work.  I learned so much about the auto auction life.  Worked with great people the management team was probably the greatest I have ever worked for, my co-workers were always helping each other we were a very closenit work family.  The hardest part of my job was dealing with irate dealership personnel.  The most enjoyable part was when the client told us we are doing a great job and had saved them "
good,the hardest part of the job is making deliveries as quickly as possible without running or being dangerous to yourself or others: while dealing with icy conditions.
good,"sim,bastante agradavel de trabalhar principalmente pela logistica que é muito boa"
good,"Typical day of work started at 3am in the morning till about 8am learned how to work on heavy equipment mainly Loaders and belt loaders for cargo planes and zip codes of the different facilities."
good,I usually unload my packages In the area that I am in and but them in order buy house then once I put them in order I load them on a golfcart and then I start my day of delveriy
good,UPS is a friendly company that you can connect with a lot of people while working in just one place. They are open 24hrs in various shifts. The management team is great and the co-workers always helping out if you need. It's a fun place to work and learn with the older employers
good,"This is a steady job.  Great for regular part-time work.  The hardest part is if you're one of the 3 a loader, unloader, or a sorter.  These are the beginning jobs in the building.  After about a year you'll learn your job well and it will be easy to do."
good,"My day started early, greeting my management team and my teammates was a great start of the day. Never a boring moment as far as the WorldShip Software was concerned. Daily something knew to learn and pass on to my many customers. Having to walk shippers thru the install of the product was great. I was always very happy to go the extra mile to make sure my customers were well prepared for their shipping needs."
good,deliver packages in the busy months around thanksgiving and christmas.
good,A great experience to learn what the drivers do in how they get so loaded..... if you get luckey like i did to become a driver helper you may go to the top of phoenixs to the top of scottsdale i seen so much beautiful things i just cant tell them all thanks to ups...and most of all meeting the people we took there packages to there homes like santa all day fun
good,"a Typical day at work at UPS was only for 4 to 5 hours and your constantly working until its time for break. Type of work we did was to Load and Unload trailors with packages. Sometimes we work alone, sometimes with others dependin on the amount of boxes we have to unload or pack. With the boxes we had to build walls so that the packages stay compact to each other and dont move while the driver is driving the truck."
good,"I worked night shifts and when I would come in and clock in I would usually go to one of the supervisors to check what station I was placed in. It usually was to load a truck or when packages would be dropping down the conveyor belt and I along with another employee would be dividing them into two groups depending which side they would need to reach to be taken by another employee and stocked in the correct truck. At times it was easy work but because of the Christmas holidays there usually was a higher number in demand. When I would be placed in stocking the trucks, co-workers on either side of me were usually very helpful tossing packages my way if I had missed them on the conveyor belt. I really enjoyed loading the trucks because it kept me busy and I learned a lot by knowing which packages went where on the shelves needless to say that when i was done the driver could barely close the back door."
good,Trabajo bajo presion por los diferentes clientes que se atendian tanto en maracaibo como en otras ciudades

good,"Loved the people, the work was beyond easy. If I hadn't been laid off I probably would have been with them for a while."
good,"First day on the job, was the big day. we had a lot of packages coming in and enough workers to get it all done; We start off with sorting the packages, then moving them to each truck that has a labeled name on it, after we get enough packages we start loading in order, after all the trucks are loaded we ship them out to each city/street by order in the truck all the air packages comes first. We insure that our business is the best to the costumers."

good,"Answering phones"
good,Working for the UPS was an eye opening experience. I was unaware of how complicated our mailing system is.
good,A typical day starts at three a.m. for me and goes until 8:30 a.m. I start by doing data corrections for addresses we are delivering so that they make it to the proper truck.  Then I help to dispatch the load to the trucks and then I work on the dispatch plans for the rest of the week and maintain the historical data.  After that I help out where needed.
good,"A typical day at work included logging in to your work station, and updating claims. I learned a lot about worker compensation laws and the federal OSHA guidelines that decided how claims were to be coded. Management was very involved, if you had any questions or needed help with anything someone was always available for assistance. Co-workers worked together on teams and picked up the slack if someone became sick or needed help. The most enjoyable thing about this job was getting to know the aspects of the work. There was always something new to learn and it was very interesting."
good,"My stay was short here do to it just being a temp job, wish it was permanent!"
good,Very nice place to work. Excelent opertunity to advance. Part time can leed to full time. Driving school avalible free.

good,wonderful people. great environment. hope to find another place like it.
good,"Fast-paced, and challenging."
good,"Answering your questions provided:"
good,A typical day for me was very strenuous and I learned different tactics to make my day go smoother. We worked together to help different teamplayers get their route finished and they did likewise.
good,"My job duties include supporting the external auditors during interim and year-end audit processes, researching and preparing footnotes and supporting documentation for the 10-Q and 10-K., reviewing financial schedules for accuracy and completeness to ensure timely filing of financial statements and accurate reporting, as well as preparing and maintaining the expense supporting documentation for all employee stock compensation award; ensuring GAAP compliance and accuracy."
good,"I worked twilight and night dispatch with the aim of moving every trailer in a timely manner. The hourly workers are teamsters, meaning we worked in a union environment, constantly mindful of the union contract.  However, by being aware of all needs, I was able to fulfill all work and hourly expectations. Using good peoples' techniques, drivers worked to expectations.  "
good,"Fast paced, had to multi task all day long, loved my regulars who were mail box holders, loved the public, my co-workers were my family, the most enjoyable part of the job was getting up every morning and going to work. The hardest part of my job was being informed they were closing the doors   "
good,A typical day at work consisted of weighing cans and writing the weights on the manifest.  Logging the numbers in the computer and sending it to the loaders to distribute the weight evenly on the plane.  My boss was a very caring individual who always listened to you.  My co-workers were always willing to help.  The hardest part of the job was the weather.  I worked outside and had very little shelter.  What I loved most about the job was the friendships that I made and that I was a part of such a great business.
good,"pre set up of work stations"
good,come in early in the morning and load the package cars ( brown trucks) load the packages in correct order in the layout each truck has. Management is strict but fair people. Everyone has to pull their own weight and do there job. Most of the whole job is hard so cant narrow it down to one thing. Most enjoyable thing I'd say is after some time the pay gets good and there benefits are unbeatable.
good,"A typical day at work is not the same everyday, you have to beable to handle pressure and do a number of things at once. "
good,"I was hired for the Christmas season as an assistant to the supervisor. I loved the job and all that it entailed! I was able to dabble in all aspects of the job so every day was new and exciting. I learned the clerical side and  aided in driver/helper support. I was offered a permanent position, but at the time was not interested in a career in the field."
good,Great company to work for. Great management team and job security. Great pay and benefits. but I was severly bitten by a dog and had to quit.
good,UPS is a great starter jobs for those who are looking to get their first job. they have awesome partime work
good,"•	Reading and marking the packaging labels"
good,I loved working at UPS. Hard work but very rewarding in the long run and i do mean the long run. They will only hire as a temp part time. If you do well you will no longer be a temp but you will still be part time. They promote to full time based on seniority and trust it takes years to become full time because how many full time employees going to quit if they are making 20+ dollars an hour. Nobody thats a job you retire from.
good,"it was a happy place to work from>"

good,work was always a good day always positive energy from all the employees
good,A typical day at work is normally busy but the atmosphere is very comfortable and the people are easy to get along with. I learned to be a proficient worker and to be willing to learn new techniques. The hardest part of the job is during peak season when there are twice as more packages to load. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the peak is over and the work load is very easy to handle.
good,I was able to look professional and become more professional just by the requirement this job offers.
good,UPS is a very hands-on job. It requires you to be very alert and attentive.  I have learned to be more productive daily.  I have decent co-workers and we work well as a team.  The hardest part of my job is making sure I stay on top of my loads and keeping a straight head when loads bag up due to technicalities.  I enjoy my job as a whole because we are one big family.
good,"It was a very fast pace job but I loved it,waiting on customers, looking up address for the ups drivers"

The opportunity to use my skills and experience to influence others and outcomes was the most satisfying aspect of the job. I worked my way up through the ranks so I was able to gain experience, and success at all levels of the business. I worked for a diverse group of managers and all were exceptionally qualified for thier posisitons. I got to see and work individuals with many styles and skills. The organization was very team focused. Building consensus with others of competing agendas was a great success of mine. The hardest part of the job were the hours. Obtaining accomplishments through the efforts of other willingly was the most important and enjoyable part of my job.  "

My managers were extremely helpful providing advice on day to day tasks. My co-workers were hard working individuals who enjoyed a teamwork attitude. the hardest part of the job would have been peak season during the Christmas Holiday season. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my fellow co-workers.

good,"The collections department is diverse in work force and it is a good way to mingle with people from different backgrounds. This kind of job provides job security for the nature of it. Managing AR accounts seems to make the day go by very fast. It is a fun experience to deal with many domestic and international companies including 500 Fortune companies. At the same time, managing accounts could be stressful at times, but managing the stress makes employees more confident."

good,"When parcels starts coming on the belt you have to be fast and accurate to separate the according to trucks and areas they are going to.You learn to work as a team and assist others who are under pressure. Management is always helping with man power if the pressure is too much especially around the festive season and thanks giving.Your co-workers are always like family because its team work. The hardest part of the job is during Christmas period there is pressure but you know if i don't send this parcel fast it might be for a little kid who only i one present coming,you have to put in extra.The most enjoyable part for me it was like a gym, work hard and you reap the benefits.

good,I enjoyed the time I worked in UPS as a contractor. People was nice and great place to work.
good,"UPS taught me alot to become more patient, loyal, supportive, positive employee to work in the workplace since 1996. The management and co-workers are complete teamwork to make this company successful. We share the feedback equally to improve the relationship with each other as well as thrive our knowledge and expertise of our job titles professionally. The hardest part of the job is getting dirty and sweat while working at UPS. The most enjoyable part of the job is to appreciate the accurate speed of minutes per boxes and rewards for various kinds of recognition."
good,Checking package truck to ensure all packages are stocked properly accourding to addresses for the area I would be delivering. 10-13 hour days working in all weather environments. Delivery of various and/ multiple packages. Customer service skills.
good,Reminded me of when I was in the Air Force work in as an Aerial Transporter. Co-workers were easy to get along with. A typical day of work was loading and unloading aircraft.
good,I so enjoyed working with the company although it was a seasonal position I truly wish I was still there. The staff were great they were well organized. The management are effective and willing to equip all of the team with all of the basic and advanced information on safety and proper work methods.

good,"A typical day at work, We come in to work and wait til the conveyor belt to start. I have learned to be a fast pace worker and a leader when it is needed.

The most enjoyable part of the job was working morning shift."
good,"My typical day at work start's off by checking the air can's for any cracks in the loading container, before I start scanning and loading packages. Up at the Air dock, I was trained and certified in handling Hazard Materials. My co-workers and I worked very well with each other, in helping each other out.The hardest part of my job was all the heavy lifting, during the real hot summers, but other than that I loved my job."
good,Typical day would consist of me clocking in & doing whatever the supervisors ask of me. It would start out slow & the packages would pick up as the night prolonged. I would load packages off the slide and shoot (rollers) then stack them neatly in a orderly format.
good,"Most recently total control of the hiring Full and Part time for Orange, Dutchess, Ulster, Columbia and Sullivan Counties. Responsible for Safery, Labor, Turn Over, Training. Management is fine along with Co-Workers who are also fine to deal with. Dealing with internal and External customers was the enjoyable part of the job."

good,* At UPS its always a typical day at work and fast paced.
good,I absolutely a wonderful place to work. I loved the fact that your pay was determined by how fast you were.
good,"Yeah you basically start off with low pay and demanding work situations but don't let that deter you from staying. I am still.a rookie barley passed my probation. First pay raise was a dollar. All your hard work and dedication will literally ""pay off"" I will admit that working at ups isn't a walk in the park its more like a timed high school mile run. But after you get the hang of your ""job"" there, it becomes easier. I am a part time loader in night sort which is a tough time to work in cuz its from 11 to usually 3 sometimes 4:30 in the morning! Also work Friday nights! So if you are considering a job at ups just be ready for hard work and punctuality. Bring a bottle of water and eat a good healthly meal before work it will help you stay energized . Get a pair of good boots I prefer some doc martens! \m/ Oh and go in with the mindset that things will get better in the long run! *helps a lot."
good,-Paid work out
good,The most amazing part of this job was delivering shipments to all stores in a popular mall right before Christmas Eve. I and my partner enjoyed this three days in a row and worked averagely ten hours per day.
good,"Working at UPS is not easy, the work is difficult, strenuous, and frenetic. What this means is that not just anybody can work and succeed in this work environment. To succeed at this company you need to have a strong work ethic and a commitment to a value system that stresses a strong responsibility to UPS customer satisfaction. While working at UPS is not easy, it is however a good job. Employees have to work hard, but they are also rewarded for their work with competitive wages and great benefits. With this being said, it could be argued that UPS produces great workers."
good,"Physically demanding job, good benefits if hired on full time. Always busy and upbeat."

good,"A typical day started at 6 am sharp. I have always been very punctual and i have never been late to a day at work. I would continuously work throughout the day. Here i learned fester, our computer system. The management was very nice as well as my co-workers."
good,"I enjoy working at the UPS store, a typical day at work, is usally quite busy, but when you have great coworkers & a resonable boss, it tends to make things a bit easier! I've learned many different things that i never thought I would. For instance, I never imagined I would know anything about packing & processing packages, quickly & efficently. The hardest part of my job would probably be, Holidays. people are always shipping items to family and friends during the holidays. Which equals to longer hours & more time on your feet! I think the thing that I enjoy the most, is all the new people I get to meet. Meeting new people never was the easy thing for me & now its a breeze!"
good,"A modern, future shapingh company which is varied and useful place of learning new skills in the field of self discipline and becoming indepedent."
good,"As a UPS Driver helper, I would deliver up to 1200 packages in a typical holiday season rush. It is very fast paced and will break you down if you do not take steps to prepare for your day. The drivers are great and they help you learn the tricks of the trade, but will become frustrated if you cannot learn fast enough (IE: How to read a DIAD, how many packages goes where and to who, how to get a signature, etc). Overall, a great place to work if you can keep up with the demand. Great room for advancement and great benefits if you can stay on with the company."
good,My typical day at work was only three and a half hours. It was extremely hard work but rewarding. We were Union members but the management was not so they did get a little pushy but our Stewards kept them off our backs for the most part. The hardest part of the job was getting up at two am every day but I did get use to it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hard physical work.
good,"Numbers drivien. Time sensitive. The moral is great, its a lot of great people to work around."
good,"We go in at 3-4 am. I had to be extremely careful with everything. I had to memorize bar codes and scan manually for specific packages. After, the trucks were unloaded we had to double check and make sure we had all of our packages. If we didn't get all of our packages then we had to go search for them in in the software then in the trucks. Our sole purpose was to make sure these expensive packages were on the proper truck ready for drop off. I learned how important it is to get a well rested night before work. The management was great. They were always around to help out and make sure things ran smoothly. The hardest part of the job was when we had to find a variety of small packages. The best part of the job was getting the signatures from the drivers and knowing the job was well done."
good,Very busy workplace
good,UPS is a great organization with great benefits and loyal employees
good,Its like your going to the gym for 4-5 hours depending on the day. you get used to it. people are very friendly and we work as a team to keep the moving and from getting any more difficult than it might already be.

good,"Very physically demanding and the hours can add to stress. You learn hard work. My co-workers were very friendly but very stressed out about the job. The hardest part of the job was getting through the week and to stay positive. Even after saying that I enjoyed all my co-workers, management, and job was enjoyable."
good,I got in and out of the truck to deliver packages to all kinds of different houses in lynn ma it was interesting met a lot of people.
good,"Day started at 7pm till about 2 or 3 am. Job was a part time job. Management was high pressure, constantly checking how much work you had done in a given period of time. Co-workers were hard working. Hardest part of job was the high pressure placed on you by management. Most enjoyable part was getting the job done well."
good,"Productive fast pace environment, high degree of employee integrity and loyalty. UPS operates with the mindset of 100% in accuracy, 100% in providing a safe work environment, and 100% in providing the customer with the best service."
good,My daily job would consist of meeting a driver at a specific location to deliver packages.
good,"Job is cool, But you dont get a lot of hours. A typical day at work is just fine. Management is just fine. My co-workers are cool with me. Hardest part of the job, Well its not that hard. The most enjoyable part of the job is....GETTING PAID! Yeah baby."
good,I loved working at UPS. The only reason I left UPS was because I was unable to earn a position in their public relations department.
good,Alot of the work was boxing and shipping and I personally learned alot from my co-workers and managers.
good,A typical day at work was to deliver as many packages as we could in the time allotted. I learned as well as proned my own people skills at a level I've never experienced. If I had to choose a part of the job I didn't like was working in the rain; put who does? The best part of the job was delivering the packages to all the friendly people and my driver made the experience fun as well. I had a good over all experience.
good,"If you're looking for a extra job on the side, this is it. Don't expect nothing above 5 hrs of work. Short breaks and yes, the company was designed to make profits, not to make you feel warm and fuzzy in the inside. Great benefits, good people to work with. They'll make anything that walks a supervisor, so that's your chance if you want to advanced."
good,Enjoyed being around customers and the day-to-day interaction with both customers and co-workers.
good,I worked 5 days a week for about 5 hours a day loading trucks with packages
good,woke up extra early to drive in the freezing weather to load multiple trucks at a time.
good,there is always work to do. on the other hand it takes 8 yrs to make full time.
good,"This company is good as long as you do not get involved with working for the Union. Yes, the Union provides great pay and benefits, but good luck dealing with the politics."
good,"Had to unload and load trucks and trailers. and sometimes i delivered packages on saturdays. mangement is very good there i wish i still worked there,should of never left but i thought it would of been better at Dari farms boy i was wrong. But it was only a PT position at UPS"

Fun group of people who were willing to help one another and showed concern for each other. The hardest part of this job was reading the handwriting on the bill of lading or determining missing information. I loved working with our group of people, they were fun and everyone worked equally to get the work completed."
good,UPS is a very physical and demanding job. The are alot of areas of growth with this company.
good,Great benefits and Always room for advancement if you worked hard enough.

good,I love working for UPS. Great company and management are okay. Only thing most people would not like is this how hot it can be in the summer time. We have good benefits but i think there could be more hours.
good,"had a blast working for UPS, benefits outstanding, great management and the ability to progress with a company"
good,"A very organized company.. Both company Management and drivers have a joint effort to make the company a very prosperous place to work, and be apart of."
good,"Reload all packages in the oubound trailers. Make sure at the end of the night your are is clean from all debris. There 2 men to each trailer loading at the sam pace to make an even wall in the trailer.The hardest part is to make sure not to scan a package that does not belong in your area,it cost the company more money to get it ship back to its rightful destination and therefore makes that substation look bad.The most enjoyable part is the loading of the trailers.it keeps your muscles loose and your body in shape.s"
good,I had deal with cool weather in winter time but still kept working and did stop until my break.
good,It was a great work experience and I would have deffinetly liked to be hired on full time instead of seasonal.

good,"The work is physical and monotonous. If you're working as hard as you're supposed to be, then it will definitely wear you out. It is a very well run company and they do an excellent job managing their people. The pay is low for how hard you have to work, but the benefits including tuitoin assistance are what keep you coming back each semester. There are opportunities to advance to part-time management, but it is much harder to get in full-time after you have graduated. Excellent place to work while you're in school."

good,You would come in your supervisor would tell you what truck to get in

good,"You come in about 15 minutes before shift start and clock in. head to your area which mine was mainly loading outbound freight and set up the trailers for work to begin. wait for supervisor instructions and then you collect your scanner and login to their system and go into your trailer and begin loading. throughout the shift you move between trailers scanning and loading packages unless you're in a trailer you're not trained on then you just load after the you co worker scans the package. at the end of the night you load any misloads, log out of the scanner, and clock out."
good,A big warehouse lots of trucks come through i worked late night shift and it's nothing but labor.

A lot of work to do in a very limited amount of time. Time management is a necessity to thrive."

I learned that people are diffrent and you have to treat them accordinly to what their moods are. If they are friendly treat them such, some peoole are all business and treat them just business. The management was good they respected you as a worker and treated us fair. The co-workers were great. We all worked as a team, one for all and all for one. The hardest part of the job was no down time during the holidays. Our shift was 8am-12am. They were long days. The last week before Christmas. The most enjoyable part of the job was informing a customer that we could perform the tasked that was asked of us, and seeing the relief on their faces. It makes me smile and glad that I could be of service."

Seasonally working was full time ($17/hour) BUT they called me back for permanent part time position & now I’m making $14/hour. I work about 4-6 hours per day & usually only work 3-4 days out of the week if I’m lucky. It’s a gateway to a great career & offers amazing benefits (even part time)"

I'm sad to see the peak season end because every morning I woke up to get ready for the day,  I was excited. Meeting customers, dogs chasing you, and the fast pace work is the best. Bonus, you get a great workout every day."
good,Though it may have been physically demanding. UPS ensures that you have all of the professional and moral support to succeed. I never thought such company has so much benefits. The pay raise was also beneficial as well.

good,This is literally the best opportunity I've ever encountered. I intend to go as far as possible within UPS and some day retire a happy driver! We are a work-family like no other and I believe it is because of the amount of teamwork required by our job. It is fast paced and can be rough but we all help each other so everyday is a blast!
good,The hardest part of this job was loading/unloading the trucks but overall it was fun to be around co-workers who energize you.  The workplace was enjoyable and management was compensating you for a full day's work and always there to help when needed.  There was also a lesson learned if you knew nothing about how UPS worked.

good,Working for UPS was a different experience being around men and women that were always smiling and happy to be at work. The hours were perfect and the work environment was fun.
good,It was a brief job due to seasonal hire. I can honestly say that this was one of my favorite jobs! I loved the people the training was excellent and they seemed to care about their employees as well as their customers. It was a joy working for UPS I fully reccomend it!
good,"Have been with this company for 17 years, have loved what I do for a long time but once you get to a certain level in management you stagnate or they train you to become vital to a specific area and do not allow you to attempt to move to other departments"

good,It was my first job and I made more than anticipated and even though the hrs were long I enjoy getting out of the house going to work. And it was a great experience for me.
good,the pace of being a truck loader and a package sorter helped me greatly at other jobs since usually i an the fastest and hardest worker at jobs and i credit that to working for ups
good,An awesome place to work for meet new people pay is great and chances for more hours come and go just have to be ready for it weekly they will work with you

They provide a customer based territory to contact and grow the business by providing support and technology to assist the customers in their business processes.  As you learn, you are a valuable team member to your customers.  "
good,It’s a nice seasonal job it’s nice hours and it pays nice they give you overtime. If you do good there they will keep you for full time and get all the Benifts that come with the job.
good,The reason I am considering retiring from UPS is because there are no chances for advancement. Most of the managers have been with the company for many years and are going to retire from the company.
good,Working at UPS was a great experience and something i would very much be interested in getting into again. Working with the driver gave great insight to how the job worked and the culture around each position. It felt great to know that my help during the busiest time of the season helped him finish before other drivers.
good,"The job was fast paced and hard working. I was responsible for delivering packages to homes/businesses as well as having great costumer service. Furthermore, The job was fun and exciting."
good,Ups a good paying job with good benefits! They are fair with their employees! That’s really all I have to dad about ups! Needed 30 more words! Or spaces

good,An honest and great place to work. Everyone is nice and is treated fairly by management. Positive culture with respect and brotherhood. Pay is always on time and management is accessible and accommodating. The benefits are second to none and its good honest clean work with proper vacation time. Contracts are approved every 5 years and Teamsters reps are available in house.
good,I think UPS helped me to gain experience different than FEDEX Groud because there is two tasks to work on mail to put organize boxes and do data entry for address labels.
good,The work/life balance is absolutely awesome! Management is very understanding and cares about you. Co- workers make the environment fun and energetic.
good,Typical day at UPS challenging to make service on commit times adjusting to weather and driving conditions I’ve learned over the 25 years at UPS and 37 years of commercial driving safety is the most important to the public to the driver personally and a liability to the company to maintain a safe Work ethic and representing the company at all times It’s important to maintain a good working  Relationshiprelationship with management
good,Very fast pace. Not a job for slackers. Trailers are extremely HOT in the summer. It would be helpful if fans could some how extend into the trailers. But over all at $16 an hr. I really do like my job at UPS as an Unloader.. Peak season is around the corner. Looking forward to working double/triple shifts and the big payroll checks that follow. 👍
good,14 years and I'm still there. It's been good to me. The benefits are amazing and I'm able to retain a regular life while holding down a solid job. I'd recommend ups to anyone.

good,I have worked a week and I love my job. It can be stressful but worth it. You get paid to work out and lose weight or gain muscle.  I an say enough about how my trainers and bosses are so awesome and helpful.
good,Working with ups was great it gave my training skills that i can now use for other employers . it kept me busy  . my typical day at work was coming in and getting to work performing my duties as an employee there . i learn that when you have great communication skills and great customer skills it makes the job easy . The hardest part of my job was unloading the truck .and the enjoyable part of my job was when the end of the day has come and you look back at work work and say i completed all what was assign to me today.
good,Good job and company to work for. Fast pace environment where you need to multitask. Yet if you’re organized you can set your own pace to work at. Good people to work with.
good,A great place to make a career.  Career paths have many options and one can have a variety of experiences.  The business is always changing and thus UPSers are challenged to change with it.
good,"Ups is ok it depend on what you do Id prefer to work in a warehouse , I like fast paced jobs and. Don't have cdl so can't drive trucks I did driver helper position as well I'd recommend that before any other position beside warhousing"
good,I love the benefits gives you flexibility to earn money but not be there all day to do it. Very wonderful people paid holidays intensive first couple of weeks until you get used to it
good,UPS is a good starting job. They pay weekly and they come with benefits and a strong union. The work that you do isn’t that bad and the hours are great depending on what shift you do.
good,"At the time of writing this, I have been with UPS for almost 4 years. It is a good company with good advancement opportunities, with good pay and benefits."
good,"I was hired by United Parcel Service as a part-time, seasonal helper."
good,Was glad to have the opportunity to work there. Supervisor was excellent in working with me regarding my schedule. Very understanding. Good start up job for those seeking employment.
good,I met some very interesting people working at Ups. Walking into the warehouse you automatically go punch in and start working on unloading packages. management was very pleasant they are always concerned about your safety in the workplace.
good,Good place to work very hands on and physical may stress some people especially those hired during Peak Season cause of high volume. My experience with management was hit and miss but for the most part Full Time supervisors i met i owe a lot of thanks too. Great benefits at the time of my hire (2004) not sure about now.
good,"I really loved working for ups. Really great,friendly,energetic atmosphere. There for you and help you do your very best and excel and advance in the company. Really family orientated company"
good,Some days it was tragic and some days it went well. There was days that I had to unload 3 trucks then go help load trucks upfront on the belts. But all together ups was a good job
good,I would recommend working at UPS to anyone that's looking for a good stable job with good pay it can be a little difficult in the beginning me and cheese start to make a lot of hours but the benefits nipppe are there
good,If you can't hustle dont apply. I was a driver helper for years every Christmas. I also worked loading up the trailers at night and I also worked loading up package cars early in the morning before the drivers can in.
good,Definitely a awesome company i hate no complaints they definitely have good management and employees working there and its a good team that help eachother out
good,Great learning experience have to be strong and alert to carry packages watch out for certain  flammable and gas liquid learned a lot with this company
good,A typical day at UPS was fast-passed and challenging.  Keeping customers happy and informed was priority while also working from the guidelines provided.
good,"The workplace culture was very easy going, but when it was time to work everyone was on task. Our management team was very organized and willing to help out in any way they could. I learned many useful things like problem solving skills when it comes to customers."
good,Ups gave me courage and strength I learn different techniques on making my job easier such as the way to lift package easier interacting with clients after each drop off getting to know our customers
good,"A typical work day at UPS was pretty easy-going, but it was hard work. I enjoyed my coworkers and the environment and learned a lot about loading and unloading in my time there. The hardest part of the job was the short breaks, but the best part of the job was the people."
good,"I feel excited and blessed to work at UPS. I feel valuable and a person and an employee. I love the challenge and excitement, especially on the ramp working with the airplanes."
good,Very good company to work for. It is a fastpaced environment but the benefits and advancement opportunities are unlimited. I only worked there seasonal as a Package Handler in the warehouse but it was a great job for what I was looking for at the time.
good,A nice place to work it’s hard work until you begin to understand their methods and utilize them. The ppl are very motivated and want you to be safe. Safety is the number one issue while working for UPS
good,Full time drivers make no less than 100k a year it’s a union backed job that has great benefits the longer you stay at UPS the better it is in the long run
good,"It's astounding to me how much of a priority work-life balance is.  As a developer, you have sprints with tasks assigned to you.  Sprints are 10 days in length, and if you don't finish all your work in the current sprint, document the work you did finish and carry over the other unfinished work in the next sprint.  Of course deadlines still need to be met, but no need to stay at work for 4 hours after the end of your shift just to finish up something that could have been done the next day."
good,Managment was nice they helped in anyways they could they made you feel like you matter plus they're family oriented and understanding. The hours were good there was overtime available for those who wanted to make extra cash
good,Amazing people to work with amazing job to do easy and the same thing everyday. You meet great people on your routes. Not everybody you meet will be great but it's honest work.
good,Fast to slow paced job. Easy way to make friends and establish a work circle. The work can beat you up some days but the weekly check and benefits soften the blow.
good,Extremely buys during the holiday season with the opportunity for additional hours in a variety of shifts. Very aggressive benefits packages at all levels. Very susceptible to weather as the facility is very large and poorly heated/cooled.
good,It was an great opportunity working at UPS I had just got out of school and was looking for work the drivers was great coworkers and always had the work environment safe and comfortable
good,I like being a drivers helper cause it shows how much you can keep up with work and not slack on the job that job is more feet work and memory and I feel like I was a great worker
good,"I worked at UPS for a couple months--good job and nice people. I recommend them,. I would go back, if the opportunity came up. I like mail and loading or driving a truck is a good job."
good,"great company not for everyone"
good,It was a hella good place to work at and the only reason I left was because of school and home issues. I wish i could go back but once you quit they usually dont let you back
good,"Providing assurance of customer package shipments or pick ups, proving customers with support of packaging items to prevent breakage. Proving at the door package drop offs"
good,"This job is a great job to have. I worked seasonal, and it is a pretty demanding, but the pay is amazing for an entry level job going in. All you have to do is not quit, and you can become a regular full-time/part-time employee. There is always the human factor that comes with some jobs, and it is seen with some of the supervisors, and also the owner, but other than that there are no problems with this job. Dress for the weather, and be prepared for nonstop labor, with short breaks"
good,"Everyday was different; the number of residentals, businesses and rural stops to the number of different packages and weather. "
good,You will work and work hard; but the pay is excellent as well as the benefits.  Management knows how to get the job done. Working with a union is a challenge.
good,I’ve learned a lot from working my associate while working only as an part time seasonal employee at the time of picking up and delivering packages day by day
good,I loved it and 15 an hour plus 150 all bonus was great!! I got to meet allot of happy people And deliver smiles all day long. Very fun and a little cold.
good,"Yes, it was a very fast paced hob but I enjoyed the continued opportunities to push myself and try other positions at the center. Great coworkers and management,  if it wasnt for my school class schedule I'd work there again in a heartbeat."
good,"We in general were always assigned to the same route.  But over the three years I worked at about a dozen different routes.  The general"
good,"It's a good place to work long term or short. This is definitely not a job to have if you DONT like hard work. They have great benefit, help pay for school, and can easily advance to management and keep going. As far as advancing to become a Driver is different, that depends on seniority and location. You MUST know that when you first start this job is not enough to pay your bills, this job is good as a second sorce of income or if you only need it for benefits."
good,HR's are very reasonable when it comes to understanding that employees may be dealing with issues outside of work. Good flexible working schedules. Some days packed with work other days light work.
good,You will not regret working for UPS the ability to move up and cross training is encouraged. You can also change divisions if you qualify. Hands down the work life balance is awesome and the benefits are golden.
good,Union member benefits and probably the best company I've ever worked for so far. Overtime after only 5 hours of work each day. Advancement in the company comes quickly. I dont plan on ever leaving UPS.
good,It takes time but speed and endurance will help. Most people are nice and open. The job will grow on you and can definitely be stressful with a nice work out.
good,"A typical work day would be getting to work 20 minutes early, going through security checkpoint walking into the airport hub, getting straight to your position and getting ready for the belts to turn on so you can start loading the semi trailers. "
good,Working At UPS Was A Good Experience For Me I Got To Meet A Lot Of New People And Learn A lot Of Things Being That I Was Dealing With ZIP codes And Packaging So It Was A Cool Experience
good,I really enjoyed working for ups. this was first time every working for a warehouse company. I love the fact that it was a fast pace job. it keep movin
good,"I liked working there. I was warned that it was physically demanding and can be rather dull after a while but I actually found it less stressful than other jobs I've had because I'm very introverted and enjoy being able to work by myself without dealing with a line of costumers. I picked up on the basics right away and was able to do most of the jobs there within a month. I don't mind the physical part because it saves me from having to go to the gym and gives you something to do rather than stand behind a counter all day in the same spot. And there were so many different people working together that it never gets boring. I was learning about Russia and Germany and Ethiopia and learning phrases in several languages, including ASL. It is rather repeatitive though and I found myself going home to dream about picking boxes"
good,"After spending the majority of my adult life at UPS, I still love this company. They stand out as a company known for honest dealing both internally and externally. They have continued to mature into a company that cares deeply for customers, the community, their employees and shareholders."
good,I had a lot of fun working this job because the guy I drove with was nice and helped me get to learn about the job. The management did a good job of helping me get hired.
good,Great place for someone looking at a career and great benefits package for employ. Treated kind and fairlyand great job experience. Great pay as well and worked with schedule as a student in college.

good,"Working with UPS one works long hours (in management) though weekends are rare except during December. Some training is provided but management is expected to update their skills. "
good,Coming in for work at ups you will always expect a busy day. It is very fast pace so I learned quickly that you would need to be physical. The management are very organized. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the packages when there are too much. It could leave a mess and block your exit of the trailer. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you're paired up with someone who is also physical and fast moving which can make the job a lot easier especially on a busy day.
good,"Great work place, everyone communicates well, good management, provides more experiences in different areas, and the areas i experienced we're loading/unloading, and sorting packages, and scanning packages and when holidays come around they provide more hours/overtime. Its a Great job i would have liked to retire from Ups but unfortunate had to leave for better pay."
good,You must be able to lift up to 70 pounds and its very fast paced work you have to be pretty fit to load or unload trucks. You dont get many hours because its such active work and you can. Only work like 5 hours max per shift
good,"Awesome job to work at. Great pay, great benefits great employees, great times for breaks, best place I worked. Security is on point with making sure the place is safe"
good,like with any mailing company there is a lot of mail especially around the holidays so if you like to be busy an always moving this the job for you fast passed
good,UPS has been the best job that I have had so far. The money is great and the insurance is even better. Paid time off and sick days. Its hard work but its well worth it.
good,Very professional. Must be very professional to succeed here. Must have a very good work ethic. Best of the best. Be on your A game. Decisions based on seniority.
good,I worked there for many years and made my way through most of the  departments.  I have to say that overall the company and the people were outstanding.  I was always motivated to keep learning and achieving by my management.  I would still be there today if I wouldn't have moved away.... MISS MY UPS FAMILY
good,UPS is a fast paced physical environment. Co-workers and bosses are great. Learning opportunities are readily available if you want them. The pay is not great BUT the family Health Benefits make up for it.

good,Working UPS seasonal was so fun. Working with the drivers delivering packages was very fun and exciting. They were always willing to help and teach you the ends and out of working for the company
good,"Inside Sales is a wonderful place to work and begin a career within UPS. They're invested in your success as well as your advancement. Training is comprehensive, but the job still takes time to learn. Communicative and responsive leadership"
good,UPS is a great company with good benefit good supervisors good training for all jobs. I enjoyed working for a company thats worldwide and has alot to offer.
good,"Being a driver’s helper is a fast paced job, but never boring! During the peek season, you could be working anywhere from 10-14 hours daily. You’ll be scanning and delivering packages to customers, with very minimal time for break. If you like being outdoors this is the job for you!"
good,"Excellent to move up in, annualy raised at .75 to 1.00,"
good,"As a supervisor at UPS, my days are fast-paced but enjoyable. Every morning is something different whether its the amount of freight, having to cover an employee, or even cleaning up a spill. I learned a lot quickly here at UPS, I learned the importance of handling every package with care, I learned how to communicate with other supervisors while working with an employee, I learned how to fill out a daily performance log on an employee, I also learned how to balance many personalities at once. The workplace environment is very friendly because it is a physically demanding job so a lot of people talk to others while working to make there day go by faster."
good,"Working at one of the UPS warehouse was very fast paced, but I enjoy jobs that keep me occupied and not focused on time. It was enjoyable for me. Everyone there where very helpful and kind."
good,The UPS Store offered a very positive learning environment. Management and coworkers worked side by side and takes your life outside of work into consideration.
good,"Ups has multiple career advantages, offers great insurance!  Pay rates are reasonable!   It’s a very reputable company offering discounts to contracted companies.   I plan to retire one day with this company"
good,"Typical days at work could go from being relaxing, to fun and competitive, to irritating, to busy. Management is great for the most part. Hardest part on the job is loading trucks."
good,UPS Is a great place to work it's a very Hard but satisfying job. I would highly recommend UPS as a career if you are looking for great pay and benefits
good,"One thing I can say is you have to want to work to work there. If you work hard the job is easy. Union can be great use it to your advantage."
good,i always had a few laughs everyda with others that work the same truck as me. The only thing stressful about the job is taking out the rollers for the trucks because they're heavy.
good,I have been exposed to a lot of equipment and information in regards to aircraft that I never knew before. The job gives healthcare after 1 year of work.
good,"Fast pace environment focusing on Safety, Service, and Performance.Stressful work environment dealing with management and hourly workforce. Daily operations driven by Safety."
good,"You never stop moving, the days go by fast. You work all day, with barely any time to breathe and when you get home you pass out, get up and do it all over again. The mail industry is no joke."
good,"Start at 8:50"
good,"I had a great time working for ups. "
good,From my experience working at UPS I enjoyed every moment at 8 times it can be stressful and complicated. There's always room to grow and to learn new things and skills pupils are very friendly
good,"Good for a work out fast pace environment none stop moving.  Great coworkers you can socialize with at work or in public, nice place to meet new people ."
good,Paid training with helpful supervisors and co workers. Co workers will assist you with heavy packages if needed. Heavy lifting is required. The hours will take a week too fully get accustomed too. Easy to get the hang of
good,I’ve been with the company for two and a half years. The benefits are great. The tuition reimbursement is awesome. Easy to move up. Friendly environment. Fast work pace.
good,It is a fast paced job that really pushes you to your limits at times. The people I worked with were all super nice and friendly and never hesitated to help you if you needed it. The environment is all around very good.

good,"I generally worked 10 hour shifts due to holiday season.  Met many different people and really enjoyed the work."
good,"I was very blessed to be hired on as a peak season delivery helper at UPS. The interview was simple, and after passing a background check, most everything was taken care of online including some training that is paid. I enjoyed the people that work there and the opportunity to work as much as you would like."
good,"A typical day of work at UPS is starting early would beeeting everyone morning before we start to discuss how much mail we have that day to be split and loaded into the right trucks by 9am, it’s fast-paced, we also talk about safety guidelines to follow throughout the week (a different safety guideline every week), check to see if we had any misleads and if so they let us know that it needs to be fixed, and workers get recognized for working hard and that all happens in the short meeting before we start work. After the meeting, we begin sorting mail. UPS has a good work environment, I enjoyed all the workers I worked with. They were helpful when I didn’t ask for help, they taught me things that they learned from working there longer than I have, and I learned that many safety guidelines on how to pick up heavy packages. The hardest part I think was adjusting my schedule to get enough sleep to make it to my 3am start time but I adjusted. The most enjoyable part is being able to work in the fast-paced environment."

During peak season, Thanksgiving to Christmas, the start time begins at midnight and would end around 9 AM. The work pace isnt too fast, but it takes some time to get accustomed to. Time flies by when working there."
good,It was fun working there I got to meet several different people and had an experience I’ve never had before. Most of my time there was spent cleaning and taking out cardboards into the dumpster.

good,It was a great place to work at its just that the pay is to low for me and the lifestyle i like to live at my age but it gets the job done til you find something better.
good,A typical day a work for me is that I scan the packages most of the time but iI am on the ramp loading the airplanes. Also I have to unload trailers and load packages into air containers. Work building shift and help in the hub. What I learn it is a fun fast pace environment company with great benefits for you and the family. The management there are very detail in there work and training there employees. The hardest part of the job is that you are outside in the hot summer and cold winter.
good,"When I worked as a driver helper for U.P.S., I learn more about actual city life. I also leaned how to put all of my abilities to use on the spot. Once the driver walked me through with what to do and what not to do, I was all good at helping him out."
good,"A typical day at work will be that the day, that trailers are hot and very much at about 120 degrees in the summer time and packages are fallen off from the trailer doors"

good,"Love the company , Great place to advance. I’m very satisfied with the weeks of vacation  I accrue through years of service. The company believes in promoting from within."
good,"Everyone is friendly and caring. Everyone is expected o be a team and have a team mindset. It is very fast paced and the standards are set very high, however, much is done to show the extreme appreciation UPS has for it's employees. There is always room to move up to a new or better position if one is desired or requested, safety is a number one priority, and the human resource dep. is beyond helpful and kind."
good,"great little part time with a future, you wont start out making a good amount but that how its set up. if you need some quick cash for the moment its not for you but if your willing to put in time like a few years you'll start to make a great salary after a while... and i do mean GREAT"
good,"Working for UPS is great. I have great benefits, get annual raises, and am basically paid to exercise. I also enjoy all of my coworkers. the environment really brings everyone closer together."
good,Fast-paced working environment with lots of physical work. Lifting up to 70lbs on a daily basis. Lots of walking and climbing in and out of package cars.
good,The day start off in the night unloading 53' trailers. The job is fast paced and you are always being timed to ensure efficiency. Its more like a work out
good,Great place to work. I started off slow but then I caught on as I continued to worked there. The people there are very professional and they want you to be on time and be about business.
good,"I enjoy my experience at the work place all the time. It's an experience to help development my skills daily, it's a versatile work culture, and is just an all around great job. If you're looking to grow with a company, this is where you should be."
good,"I only worked ther a couple of months and enjoyed it but, being 67 years old, I found it too difficult and painful to do the work. They moved me to other positions to try and find something I could do without pain but, eventually, all would get to me, so I decided to leave."
good,"I have enjoyed working for UPS and have been very grateful for the opportunity.  However, I went to college for two years to get a degree in Criminal Justice and want to pursue a career in a security position and at this time there are not any openings in security.  The company itself is awesome with a great work environment, good pay, and outstanding benefits."
good,"Great place to work."
good,I got to experience good customer services and learnt new tips and tricks whilst working with my driver it made my days easier. However the department was a bit unorganised in terms of hours of work and which drivers you will be working with.
good,UPS provides a fast-paced workplace with many opportunities for advancement. The variety of shifts allow the part-time positions to be worked into any schedule. Great employee benefits and paid time off. Would recommend to anyone who is willing to work hard and enjoys Tetris.

good,"I have never worked in a position like the one I held temporarily at UPS. It was a fun fast paced job where I was able to communicate, build relations and grow as an individual."
good,"At UPS everyone starts as a Package Handler and we all move up the chain finding our own career within the company. You'll find that in any position there are great benefits provided to even the entry level positions. Package Handlers gain full health benefits, 2 weeks PTO in a part-time position where workers don't usually work more than 20 hours a week after a year of employment."
good,"Good place to work and advance within the company."
good,"I was a seasonal driver helper, assisting drivers in delivering packages to commercial and residential customers, fast paced during Christmas and requires some heavy lifting at times."

good,"Great Managers and coworkers"
good,Great environment. People help each other when they can and the staff is always understanding if something happens and supervisors are always checking on you and giving as much as advice as they can
good,UPS is a very challenging and rewarding place to work. The small package environment is one where where processes are of the upmost importance in order to meet service commitments. At UPS there is a strong sense of teamwork in order to do what it takes to get the job done. Integrity is something that is valued at UPS and to me personally
good,This job is a fast paced environment  and aome of the people are great helpers when needed if you want to learn in this industry you will its also great if you would like to advance further down the line
good,"I personally love the atmosphere, the management, co-workers.....i great place to work i wish i was permanent. The employers and employees are very curteous and helpful, its definetly a team enviroment an d afford"
good,"I enjoyed every bit of the experience that I have gain in the past years with UPS, I would 100% recommend this job to any of my friends and family. "
good,You have a basic plan for your work day. But being an air cargo facility plans change on the fly. Flights maybe canceled or added. Therefore your work load will change.
good,Working at ups was a great experience. I learned there are multiple ways to hurt yourself if you don't use the proper lifting and lowering methods. The only hard part of the job was trying to avoid misloading boxes onto he wrong truck.

However, it is a wonderful place to work with advancement opportunity for a dedicated employee who shows up before the shift starts, consistently performs well, and has a good attitude."

good,"A fast paced position where i worked with an experienced UPS driver to deliver 300-1000 packages to 170-250 stops a day. excellent benefits, worth the demanding work."
good,Having almost 8 full years of employment you learn a lot and see a lot of turn over you would think?  I did not with this location yes I saw people come and go but most due to them having 25 plus years of service that exciting?  If I could transfer within i  would we will see?  If only they would let you transfer within the company outside the company from within?  That would be great?
good,"Working at UPS was the best experience of my life. The training I received while working there was second to none. This is a top notch company who treats their management with respect and in return expects the ""whatever it takes"" attitude. Very fair compensation and excellent benefits along with stock options and matching 401k."

good,I learned a lot while being a drivers helper I got to meet a lot of business people and very sweet customers. My driver was very helpful and was always there for me I hope to apply again once the winter season comes around again.
good,This employer is one of the best to work for.  Protected by the union they offer job security and one of the few companies today that offer full benefits to its part time employees working less than 30 hrs wk.  Learned a new skill set in shipping/receiving and became knowlegible about ups label system and loading/unloading procedures.  They have experienced team leads who assist with production goals and evaluate your performance on safety guidelines daily.  Overall if you like a challenge and physical work i highly recommend this company.  Great leadership.
good,Fast passed and very rewarding. Best company I have ever worked for hands down. A company where they take very good care of there employees. They offer very good benefits like health insurance.

good,"You will be required to work, be ethical and take care of your customer's UPS  is a fair company that treats employees as partners. Management is number driven"
good,Working at The UPS Store was a very pleasant experience for me. The management was amazing and very understanding. It was very busy during the holiday which was a little crazy but it was nothing I couldn't handle.
good,"I worked for UPS as a seasonal driver helper for about 4 weeks. It was a fast-paced job, but the drivers I worked with were fun and easy going, so it made the job a fun one to have."
good,You make a lot of money in a short amount of time and you get loads of hours and good psychical exercise. My employers were respectful and the driver I road with was amazing.
good,It's very hard work but great exercise. Expect that if you are working during holidays that you will be out until 10pm. The holiday season is where most of your hours will come in. The most enjoyable part is being around awesome people and meeting different people and making friendships with drivers.
good,I worked on the Southern States account for the majority of my career at UPS Freight. Before that i drove otr and still enjoyed my time there.  I left on good terms i was just hoping i could get something more towards my home.
good,"The job wasn't hard, it was just a workout. You may lose weight. The coworkers were friendly, as well as the supervisors. I worked the sunrise shift (4am-9am). It was easy to still have a life after you get off."
good,Fast paced environment but it’s a fun work environment also. I’m a student at a aircraft mechanic School looking to work my way to a mechanic for the airlines once I’m done with school
good,"Équipe très sympas , bonne ambiance au travaille bon chef’ dequipe"
good,"my body is on the most part hurt when i get home home , so to me that's a con. A pro is that we don't work that long but while we work we really work."
good,"a very good company to work for but very hard to get a full time employment. Safety is a top priority and that's great for UPS employees. The company allows employees to buy shares and that's great for investments. Also, UPS provides a competitive benefit package for its employees and their family."
good,"I love the fast pace of working as a helper and personal vehicle driver for UPS. They pay well and management is great and understanding. You get a good knowledge of area roads and businesses. It's hard outside in the elements while working, but great exercise. As a helper, your day varies from 3-8 hours a day. I would love to work for them year-round, but too far for me to drive every day."
good,"If you are anywhere but Brownwood, Texas, even the part-time loading positions are worthwhile.  You will get 30 hours in most places.  In Brownwood, the place is so small that there is not enough work to work part-timers more than 15 hours a week who are low on the seniority list.  That is the only con.  The work is hard, but they pay well by the hour, and the insurance is second to absolutely no one!  It is free as well, so it really offsets the low hours.  Even part-timers get a week vacation after they have been there a year.  They have a pension for full and part-time employees, and a 401k available.  If you make it to a full time driver, they top out at $32/hour or so, and often work some overtime, making for massive earning potential."
good,"I would've loved to stay @ UPS. I had a great boss, good job, no stress and I was surrounded by great coworkers. I only left because it was too much on me to travel from my full time job @ Newark Airport to UPS in Parsippany for over night hours."
good,"Regular part time loader shifts are around 15 hours, but you can get up to around 50 hours during peak season depending on your availability. Unique in that you qualify for overtime pay as a part-time worker. Frequent opportunities for advancement, and yearly raises."
good,Working at “UPS” is great because they recognize hard work and they are helpful.UPS pay is great because you get paid every week and you can always get a raise for your hard work.
good,"A typical day at work for me was assisting the driver deliver packages. During my employment I learned, delivery logistics such as organizing the boxes by street address and number. The work place culture was enjoyable because when I needed help with some thing my coworkers were there to assist and support. The enjoyable part of the job was that every driver was not the same the routes were also different."
good,"I worked for UPS for 18 Years, and I left in 1988 because my Husband I started our own used car lot. but I loved working for UPS, I started as a Switchboard Operator in 1970, where I answered calls transferred them to the proper people, and took messages. then I was promoted to Customer Service  where I also answered calls and took orders for picking up packages for delivery, and sometimes greeted people with packages directing them where to take them to ship, then I was promoted to Next Day Air, where we coordinated the destinations  where the packages were to be shipped by air  and kept records and times for the flights"
good,"This envirment has everthing that you need to know about speed on delivering your work load at your station. there is always good comute among the people their, and always willing to help if needed."
good,nice people hard working we get benefits I really can't say nothing bad about UPS. Ive been there for some time now I love the work flow its like going to a gym .
good,At UPS the opportunity to advance in an area is endless and always available. The face paced environment shows how well everyone really works together. The management team has their meetings every day right before the sort starts to go over the day before results and how they can improve the up coming sort. During my time at UPS i learning a lot about where and how the delivery items are processes and how they end up from the company to the customer and it was really awesome.
good,"I loved working at UPS, and I love working for the family that I work for, they have pretty much treated me like family! Great environment! I'm only leaving in the near future to start a career, and also to continue schooling for my career, I loved the employees I worked with, and all of the corporate employees as well as the drivers!"
good,Was able to get out and meet other business owners and work with different people. Is a fast-paced job that requires lots of movement and lifting heavy boxes but overall the pay is great.
good,"The managers and supervisors were always helpful and friendly. The company also offered excellent benefits to their employees. As someone who worked there part time, my typical work week was Monday through Friday from about 4-9pm"
good,Ups is a fast pace work environment. Great place to work but could be a little stressful if you are not ready for the fast pace environment. They have great benefits.
good,"UPS offers a lot of desirable assets, but be prepared to work long hours. You get weekends off which is a plus but you may be working until 7pm or later Mon-Fri. I had to miss several of my children's sporting events, proms, and other special events because of working late hours."
good,"Driver helper position was amazing.  If more hours or a permanent position was available, I would definitely consider going back.   Very quick paced and excellent atmosphere."
good,UPS is a very good job. The benefits alone make it worth working there. The environment is not air conditioned so you are exposed to weather conditions.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at UPS, and hope to go back when the timing is better for me. I would say overall that this place is the best place I've ever worked. In every aspect someone could want a job to be. 100% recommend this place to anyone who wants to work hard, be a part of something that matters, learn every day on the job, or be part of a family that get's down to business and get's things done. Thank you."

good,A typical day at work is demanding and fast paced. You have to be alert and quick. Hardest part of the job is the lifting. The most enjoyable part is the compensation and recognition for hard work.
good,"I was temporary help, but my mother was a 17 year veteran when she died of breast cancer. UPS made sure she stayed insured during the 5 years of treatment, gave her short and long term disability payments and organized a benefit that raised over 35k to help pay for travel and living expenses."
good,"When you work for UPS you are never in the same place working,  you might work the counter are the computers and you have ever to answer the phones to help people find a package are to let them know where the package is and how long it will take for the package to be delivered."
good,Loved working for this company. Great people all around. Great Pay and benefits. Great first job opportunity/part time job. Wish I could of kept working there.
good,"I have found in my time at UPS that the job teaches me discipline on deadlines and high expectations on work performance. Every day on the job I feel a sense of accomplishment as they help me work towards my future goals."
good,I learned something new about ups and how some days are just not long to get everything out. The driver that I helped out was very friendly and helpful
good,"There never seemed to be a dull moment. The management was competent, and the staff was team oriented. I had fun working in a fast-paced environment with a strong tram"

good,"I love working for UPS. I know many people who don't, and I know many people who couldn't handle it. But if you're stubborn, hard working, and don't mind getting paid to work out then sign up!"
good,"Full benefits for a part-time job, you can't beat that. The hours vary so there's no set amount but with the addition of a night sort during the peak season you can make extra money."
good,i cannot beliieve that i have to type some fake stuff just to get past the check to finally post my resume on the inter webs .this is so unfair i have stuff to do
good,"Once you get past the first two weeks, everything starts to become second nature. You begin to pick up your pace in every aspect and tasks can be completed more quickly. Very quick working environment. Good for those who intend to stay in shape. 10/10."
good,"UPS provides good compensation. Management is reliable. Boss are very helpful, always thinking about the employees necessities. Consideration is always there as long as you are reasonable. This is one the great companies in my location."
good,"UPS has given me ultimate warehouse and trucking experiences. I also learned the proper and safe lifting techniques by recognizing feet positioning, my power zones to afford stain on my back, and how to use the equipment to aid in large freight."
good,"Lots of seasonal positions, you get to pickup hours during the slowest moving time of the year for summer tourist areas. If they retain you then you will be on your way to nice things. Lots of options to transfer and relocate if necessary."
good,"excellent place to work, I was hired for seasonal employment would go back again  if requested my assignment was to schedule helper with the dric=vers for delivery of packages during the holiday season"
good,being a driver helper was exciting. seeing new areas and the properties that we had delivered too was beautiful. I would definitely work for UPS again. Delivering merchandise to the customers is the best part.
good,Muy buena. Exelente trato buen horario ybuena paga
good,"I think ups is a great and understanding job."
good,"I only worked seasonal, only a month. But it's a good company to work. Fast paced, driving all day just making deliveries to homes & companies. Get an hour lunch & pay is good as well"
good,I started as a temp and became permanent at the companies request.  The only thing I could say negativity is that office administrators do not work 40 hrs a week.
good,A typical day at ups was hard but fun . I Learned How To Unload and Organize packages . The Managers Were helpful and friendly . The Hardest Part Of The Job Was having short breaks
good,"I worked for The UPS Store and it was a great experience.  It was great helping soldiers and other customers send and receive packages.  I learned how to deal with employees, schedules, inventories, and marketing."
good,It's a very demanding job where the coworkers are very friendly. The company is very reliable and willing to offer help with what ever you need. I also like the fact that at the company your allowed to climb the latter as high as you can with no restrictions
good,"The work is very fast paced so be prepared to walk fast, read labels, and memorize where to put boxes. I thought that the pay was very good, per hour."
good,"ups constantly strives to be world class industry. they lead in innovations in technology, service and business. ups is no longer just in the business of moving packages and freight. they are many companies. too many to name. hence the brand, ups. one company, one brand.  they create a an atmosphere of safety and brotherhood among employees. they survey employees to find the best solutions for improving equipment and work environment. they always acknowledge and recognize employees for achievements and safety. benefits and pay are the best in the industry."
good,"This was a great place to work , if you apply your self you can advance within this company, the hours can start very early and be a long work day , but you are advised of this well before your offered a position there, so its no surprise ."
good,the day of a driver helper is just as long as a regular ups driver. the weather is sometimes harsh but the pay makes the job worth it. the most enjoyable part of the job is being out all day in all neighborhoods
good,"Very easy work, physically demanding. What I didn't expect was all the different walks of life that worked there. I still keep in touch with a few people from there. Some people may not like working from 4am to 8am but I didn't find it too bad. I"
good,I feel ups is a good place for someone loves lifting boxes loading trucks driving trucks and jus basically doing with they love I also think its a god learning experience for someone who has never work with labor
good,"It has been a rewarding experience to work with various UPS departments to design and implement customer solutions in the area of domestic and international shipping.  One of the interesting aspects of this is the development of innovative solutions to assist major clients such as Amazon. The same is true for designing package-flow solutions for business and residential customers.  One example of this is a newly introduced program that allows on-line purchases to be directed to alternative delivery locations such as UPS stores and other drop/storage/pick-up points.  Being associated with a highly successful company such as UPS and sharing and implementing their vision has been quite rewarding.  The ""real-time"" aspect of this business where performance and dependability are absolutely critical has been challenging and satisfying. It helps to work in an environment in which INTEGRITY is highly prized.  It has indeed been a pleasure to work at UPS."
good,"Working here is not for everybody. You have to be determined  and actually enjoy your job because it gets difficult.  My managers were awsome  you cant expect for anybody to hold your hand because its very busy if you have to take notes do so. People get annoyed when you ask the same questions over and over. I am a woman and im over weight yet i still did my job and lost weight while doing it!!! No excuses  get it done is the mentality. By the second week you should be able to do things on your own. Also make nice with a veteran they can give you tips or even help you this way you dont have to bother your supervisors too much. Even though payroll is supposed to keep up with time sheets , keep your own personal log just in case. Be ready to work and have fun at UPS!"
good,This was a long term contract. Felt like a full time job. Loved the environment and co-workers. The company moved all its work overseas which lead to lay offs for everyone.
good,"Be in and ready to work by the allotted time. Work safe and efficiently, i had to move 1100 packages an hour. working in the trailers was hot. but all in all it was a great place to work"
good,everyone was nice and helpful. workout and get paid so that is always a plus. hours ran a little later when the rush season opened up but nothing too crazy. I would love to work for the company again.
good,I like working here. The people are nice . It's a really fast paced job which I don't mind it's a good work out. Just always come rested and prepared .
good,"fast pace environment,Load and unloading packages on the truck,sorting packages . Lifting and lowering E rays throughout the day. 3-  4 hours a day on the job"
good,"A typical day of work for me is braking a sweat that lets me know I'm doing a good job of managing my work, I also work well with others or by myself, The hardest part of work for me is telling myself that there is no hard part of work, and the most enjoyable part of work is knowing that you actually have a job."
good,"They offer lots of ways to move up in the company, and even the people like me who start at the bottom are treated with respect. They like to promote from within and that's another thing i appreciate."
good,i learned alot on this job. i learned how to communicate to the employees that i worked with. learned about the safety regulations and how to enforce them to the employees. learned how to check conveyor belts and break jams on the belts.
good,The company offers opportunities and benefits to anyone who wants to make a career in the company in addition the workplace is welcome by amount of interesting people one knows.
good,Worked night shift it can be rather easy in the summer tome but when the christmas rush comes in expect long nights and make sure to be in very good physical condition. They are very flexible with your hours no reason not to apply.
good,"Great customer interaction. "
good,Very tiring and stressful job. Fast paced and can be overwhelming at times. Hardest part is being fast and efficient at the same time. You have to be able to get packages for truck 204 into 204 and not have any from 203 or 205 in 204. Then it counts as a misload and you get chewed out for it.
good,I enjoyed working here and learning new things about the shipping business! The business is very fast paced and at times stressful but I am very happy with my salary. I would recommend this job to friends and family!
good,"Everyday was different, but everyday you learned something new.  Your expectations are to work at a high level, and you have plenty of opportunity to reach the goals that are set for you.  Your managers and supervisors care about your performance, and work with you to improve and become comfortable about your work and your goals.  Hours may sometimes be tricky, but working with UPS teaches you to be responsible an abide by a schedule that will make balancing your social life, work, and even school easy.  You do however get the chance to move your way up in the company and become very successful using the opportunities UPS provides you with.  Being paid generously and offered benefits, you are given fair expectations in exchange. Overall a great company to work for!"
good,"I was working with a great driver who made the work enjoyable. I worked in a neighborhood that allowed us to deliver packages using a golf cart. Great experience, I would definitely do it again."
good,A lot of heavy lifting in a fast and nice past. When it's hot it's hot and when it's cold it's cold so dress for how the weather is that day. Part time job only
good,"a typical work day was great .All my co-workers worked together as a team to finish fast, efficient and at a timely manner so that the drivers can head out for there deliveries on time."
good,"A typical day at work, was loading the truck, delivering to different businesses and residential homes, entering information into the DIAD to ensure accurate information to the company."

good,"Working for UPS was great, everyone is so nice and welcoming. The work includes a lot physical activity but it's a great work out and please there are just friendly. The staffing team is on top of everything. They provide snakes every Friday to get your day going. If you're unhappy with your position they work with you to find a great match."
good,loved every minute i was there for the holidays. We usually worked from 9am to around 6pm sometimes later as it got closer to Christmas. Management was awesome to all of us drivers.
good,"Being a driver helper is wonderful! You get really flexible hours, and weekly bonuses just for showing up when you're suppose to. Since it is a seasonal job, it only lasts a month or so. But it's well worth it."
good,"UPS is a great company in my opinion to work for. It may be a fast paced environment that requires a worker to work a decently fast pace at times but the benefits greatly outweigh the negatives. UPS has some of the best benefits that you can find at any company and part time employees are able to receive these after a year. Also, UPS offers tuition reimbursement right off the bat. Additionally after a year, employees are able to pick their 2 paid weeks of vacation off and the weeks increase as you work there longer. If someone knows what they're getting into at UPS they will love it."
good,"A productive day at work would be unloading UPS trucks in a orderly fashion time. This is a fast pace job, walking at a brisk pace, lifting up to 85 pounds and staying hydrated."
good,Fun cool and amazing place to work the people cool and management can be a pain in the but sometimes maybe just don't know how to talk to you like you're a human being but for the most part there's lots of room for advancement pretty quickly
good,"Hop on the Truck"
good,"excellent company, with a pension available....moreover it is a secure, fortune 500 hundred company with benefits galore...The management offers you a chance at advancement as well as fair assessments of your skill sets."
good,I been working for UPS for 8 years it's a great job to work in and you meet alot great people and learn a lot from each other it has great benefits and one of the best one for me is that they help you with college
good,"My driver and I went along very well together. Was very patient with me, cracking jokes to pass the time and randomly telling stories throughout our deliveries made this job enjoyable throughout the cold."
good,"UPS is a great company to work for, there benefits are wonderful and their hours are flexible. There are many opportunities to become more than just a part time package handler."
good,Overall U.P.S is a good place to work salary is good the whole overall experience is Awesome. The staff is wonderful and the pase you work in is also negotiable you can work fast or move up and work at any pase you want
good,"friendly, comfortable environment with very approachable people. every day is structured and consistent. lots of room for growth within the company at any stage of entry"
good,"Work day starts with a pre communication meeting. Crews get assignments for the day. Which planes each crew does, times of arrivals and departures and volume numbers, What equipment "
good,Help the driver deliver packages on the truck. very physical job with long hours if requested. decent pay. great management and a wonderful upbeat team.
good,"well, what can I say UPS was my first Job when I was 18 and it took me like 5 times before I got the Job.Ups become my home because it was the only Job I have ever worked that had me so worked but being around a bunch of cool people and management they had them up and downs but what Job doesn't.overall my experience with them was great"

If u work hard u can move up and have a great career there as a driver.Great benefits and retirement plan flexible shift but they are short depends on the volume of work daily.

good,"Training is paramount in the UPS philosophy.  I learned life skills.  Everything from safety on the road, to how to be safe at home.  I admire the workplace culture.  The culture encourages a team mentality.  I was always challenged with every new assignment."
good,Making sure the packages scan and put in the right trailer and make sure the packages are not damage.make sure the packages load in and pack tight and high.
good,This job required a lot of  loading of boxes onto trucks and organization skills. I thought my time there seemed longer than what I actually worked because I was continually loading boxes as a part-time package handler. I would recommend that people work there if they are just looking for a part-time job. I suggest to those who like to work there long term to choose a field in HR or Management.
good,"UPS was a fast pase job, it will definatly keep you in shape and very busy. You get to know your driver on a very personal level which makes it all that much more great . I recommend this as a first job for anyone!"
good,"It does include hard labor, need ability to kneel, climb and stand several hours without breaks. Learn how to load trucks , and handle packages. Be able to lift over 70 pounds with constant speed."

good,I loveed working for xci the company was a good company I meet all type of different people really opened me up on my people skills I love working in the outside inside enverioment
good,Since the first day its been nonstop work which is fine for me. Never a boring day and time flies by quick. It could be frustrating at first but hard work pays off.
good,"Great part time jobs for students or people looking for a second job. Crazy benefits like the army, and navy. Can move up in managment quick if you really try and bug managment. Every year this company grows and more job opportunities come. Can become a driver by age 21 but must be patient."
good,The company overall was a good experience while I was there. My co-workers were pleasant to be around and the pay was great. Nothing bad to say at all.

good,I had the privilege to work with an amazing team and am very grateful I was a part of growing with this company. I have learned a lot from each individual and truly enjoyed my everyday work life there. We all were devoted to making the best quality print jobs for all of our customers and everyone worked hard and well with each other! I have taken everyone individual's qualities and applied them o my own work ethic that I saw helped grow the company into a profitable and reliable business.
good,Its was a great job would go back and do it again it also could be a good work out sometimes lifting and moving all sorts of things but overall I just think it's a great job.
good,We are a loading and unloading company. They help pay for college after the first year you are there. And for hourly they pay for your insurance. It is a great job
good,"It was a hard but easy job, you got to be head strong and have the body management cause UPS do work you, willing to lift heavy things and being on your feet long periods of times."

good,Working with ups was fun for me because it is a very fast pase and you get to go to alot of places amd and get a good work out while you are on the job.
good,Working for UPS was a good experience. I was able to meet and work with new people. I was able to learn how to unload and load aircraft's from different sizes. I learn how to be able to do different jobs in one as the day progress.
good,This job was pretty fun. I am going to be a seasonal driver helper again if they re-hire me. Getting along with your driver is a must in order to understand the job and make the best of the work.
good,"Awesome benefits,                                                                      good hours.                                                                                   great management team.               quick advancement."
good,UPS is a great company to work for and they offer a really good benefits package. They start at well above minimum wage and have really good opportunities for advancement.
good,Had a good time within the short year I worked there as a package handler and worked up to hazmat auditor and could have been supervisor had I stayed but other things worked out for IF you need a job I would recommend ups
good,"A regular day involves sorting and loading mail unto outbound trailers. UPS is very involved with a safe work environment. Employees there are like family, communication is very good between managers and all employees. UPS is very competitive with all tools to perform all job tasks"
good,"It's a wonderful work place. An amazing experience, great hours and benefits. Wonderful people.. great experiences there. Great supervisors. Love the job all in all"
good,"The options a endless in this company. It's cut and dry . that's pretty much it, anything else said would be over sale. Like right now, being asked to say more than required, an over sale."
good,"What i liked about the job was that, not every day i would do the same thing. Some days they would have me unload the feeders, other days i would sort packages based on address and other days i would load company trucks."
good,"Good pay, but hard work , seniority is everything here put in the time you get it back. Builds character stamina and strength,  think about working out and getting paid"
good,"Great place for employment . Great pay and benefits.There are plenty of programs for advancement."
good,Nothing but good all the way around if you're looking for a great long term job UPS is the place. Plenty room and encouragement to advance. Just takes forever to get a full time position
good,Started in August of 1980 as a part time employee responsible for all loading/unloading and sorting of all parcels. In 1984 promoted full time delivery driver. Responsible for all delivery and pickup of all parcels. Retired at the end 2006.
good,UPS of is a very good company to work for they have great benefits they offer people that want to go to school school opportunities lots of advancement it's a great career
good,I loved working there I just didn't understand how I was picked for a certain shift and was told I had to work into the next shift everyday and than when I made accommadations they hired more people and than was telling me I couldn't stay.
good,A typical day on at the job would be about 4 hours long. I learned little within the 3 years I worked there but did learn a little bit of valuable information on supply chain management.
good,"I loved working for this company, they take good care of their employees. The job was fun, fast-paced, physically demanding and very interesting. I wish the position hadn't been just a seasonal job."
good,The work place was stable. I appreciated the staff there as they always helped if I needed something. I did not like how my checks were always short .
good,Have been in the package delivery business for 38 years .I have met many people over my career. I really enjoy meeting and getting to know my customers and providing them with excellent service.
good,"A lot of experience , a lot of fun , verry nice place to work ,all the coustumers  verry nice, allways like a team.verry happy to work allways in UPS."
good,It's a great place to work because of how consistent it is. If you have good customer service you'll do great here because of how many customers you interact with on a daily basis. The management and workplace culture makes it easy to work there and most times fun.
good,"Right when you clock on you get straight to work. Straight to packing boxes in a trailer for 6 hours, minimum. Communication is key just as it is for other jobs! The hardest part about being a package handler at UPS is was that it's constant movement, if you can keep up with the paste then the earlier you got to leave. Have to keep the assembly line moving or it gets backed up and then that's just more hours for you."
good,Great  company to work for my daily work consisted of delivering packages. Meeting  new and exciting  people. The driver taught me on safety and learning  how  to read labels and using  the scanner.
good,"I believe It was a learning experience because not only was I learning how to work in pairs to get the job done, it also made me learn how to save Money"
good,Was fun and really productive environment. Safety is their #1 priority.I learned a lot of safety tips like crossing the street behind the vehicle. The hardest part was the cold winter. The most enjoyable part is making the customer happy with prompt delivers.
good,"The work load was constant from beginning to end. I learned what it takes to be a leader and good supervisor. Management was always willing to help and guide me any time I needed it. Co-workers made for an enjoyable work atmosphere, if it wasn't for my co-workers and superiors, I may not have stayed there as long as I did. Hardest part of the job would be when the work load would become too much for the employees under me and I would have to manage them very quickly and efficiently to constantly changing conditions."
good,"Working with UPS was a great opportunity. Even though the position was temporary , I was treated like a normal employee. I learned alot such as sorting and loading mail while working for ups. I also got to explore new places and learn new towns. As far as managment , UPS is great. You can call and talk to your managers at any time about anything as far as job wise. The managers are also understanding. The hardest part of the job is really getting packages delivered on time in the midst of traffic."
good,"I would get into work, clock in then we would head to our assigned trailers and start offloading packages. Once I was done, I would inform my supervisor and he would assign a new trailer. Sometimes the supervisor would come inside the trailer with you and help you unload. Some days he would stand at the door and see what speed your taking to off load a trailer. Most of the days we would work two people in a trailer and that was good, you could get work done faster. The hardest part of the job was when we got heavy packages and we were short on staff so you had to do it all by yourself. The part that I liked about my job was that you were assigned to offload a trailer and your supervisor would let you get to work and not bother you."
good,I had the opportunity to work 2 jobs and this allowed the flexibility but consistent schedule to obtain the balance. The benefits were cheaply priced for a part timer and worked within my budget.
good,Once you put your time and devote yourself it becomes a great job. I honestly wish I still worked here but a series of events led to me having to quit abruptly.
good,"Great employer for the most part, fast moving atmosphere along with great benefits medical and dental.This job depended on teamwork being efficient.Great diversity in co-wrokers equal opportunity employer."
good,"Love the physical work, but not the hours. Would like to continue UPS as an secondary job do to the pay. I learned how to color coordinate the states and the zip codes. Management was awesome very reasonable, Although Supervision can use a little work. Co workers are very helpful throughout my employment here. The hardest part was learning the states by zip code but soon after 2 weeks was able to memorize. The most enjoyable part is when everyone is doing their job and the process is smooth. The trucks are done in a timely fashion."
good,Great company lots of opportunities for growth within the company Great full-time benefit package for you and the family also offers  paid  tuition for college  if you would like to further your education
good,If you are a active person the job fits for you. 70 pound lifting and the customers sure alot of hositipalily! And its good on your resume but it's only seasonal
good,"I love the people I work with, just not receiving the hours I need.  There are great opportunities and great benefits after the first year. It's a very fast paced job and the days go by fast."
good,"To be honest this place was good in the beginning. Easy work place, nice coworkers, But that changed over a course of 10 months. But it was a good place to work. I want to go back."
good,"A typical day begins at 0830 finishing loading the delivery vehicles, between 0900 and 0910 we exit the building to begin our delivery day with rush packages (guaranteed by 1030), business deliveries before close of business, and finally residential packages."
good,Wie gesagt ist alles in Ordnung nur ich brauche Herausforderung und möchte natürlich auch mehr verdienen 😁
good,"It's a good job, fun bunch of guys"
good,"A typical day for me working at UPS in the airport is pretty easy. First off you get there and set up the gate for the type of plane. Then you bring the plane in and unload it. We get a 30 minute to an hour break depending on where the plane is going. Once the upload is ready we do the upload. Management as a whole are easy going people who understand what life really is about(plus we are union members so they necessarily stay in their lane). My co-workers are a great bunch of MoFo's, I mean you get the guy who think he knows everything even though he just started but they are still great people. The hardest part of the job for me is trying to quit since they not only have great benefits such as healthcare for me and my family and discounts just about everywhere, why would I leave such a great place? In all honesty the most enjoyable part is just being there, I've never had a problem here and I don't think I ever will. I recommend UPS to everyone."
good,I was able to drive out to Addison which is 20 minutes to commute. Arrive to punch in at 10:50 P.M. work one bay until 2 A.M. get my first 10 break then work until 4 A.M.
good,"Making deposits, print production, programs in the Microsoft Suite (excel,word,publisher, etc.), adobe programs(photoshop and acrobat), lift large boxes correctly, billing customers properly, properly package items , shipping (within federal legal regulations), setting up personal mailboxes and sorting the mail and packages for them daily, calling customers, operating a postal meter/printer, up selling and cross selling, managing others to help keep up Store production and cleanliness, ordering supplies, communicating with other business owners and schools in private meetings to sell products, printing for all sorts of business and recreational activities."

good,"Perform customer service duties in a retail set up	"
good,"UPS is one of the best company to work for. I just could not handle the part time being that I have a family. If you could stick it out, you will be set. Free benefits, awesome company!"
good,"You must be physically, mentally and job ready at all times. The job is fast paced. Keeps you on your toes. You must be able to interact with others. As well as motivating/encourage others."
good,Working at ups was a great thing for me because i always wanted to work for the postal services and the people that worked at ups gave me great experience at that job so i think you.
good,"A typical day at work is getting up very early, which Is the hardest part of the job. my co-workers are really easy to work with and very cooperative. The thing I like most about my job is that it keeps me physically fit by loading parcels onto lorries."
good,The management make sure you're happy or at least try there best! If you don't feel good they make sure you get to sit down and take a break!
good,"The best job I ever had !!!! I would love to be permanent... I would never leave ! I loved this job. I relocated down to Charlotte, NC and would love to get the opportunity to get on perm either as driver or package car driver."
good,"Being an employee for over the years has given me the experience to grow within the company. Also, take what I've learned and incorporate those skills in other warehouse jobs."
good,"I enjoyed the time I worked for UPS, it is a top rate company. The people are hard working and have great pride in what they do. Would be happy to work with them again."
good,A typical day at work is anything but typical in the data center environment.  My day can range from managing projects and drawings to addressing equipment failures and coming up with solutions. I learned that paying attention to detail is very critical in every aspect in an environment where there is no room for error. I had a great relationship my co-workers. What I enjoyed most about the job is the day to day challenge of operating a data center to keep my mind stimulated.
good,"Great place to work, frienly co-worker,very helpful each other and very professional, very good scheduled, and customers very friendly too."
good,very fast and steady work place. It challenges you to keep up with the flow of work and load all the packages in the proper trucks and proper order for delivery
good,Working at UPS was great. They gave me the hours i needed. The pay rate was unmatched and the benefits are outstanding. I would recommend working at UPS to anyone.
good,On a typical day at work as a driver helper I woke up every morning at 7:00 am to be there for 8 am. We would do our routes from 8am- to about 10 at night.
good,Work started as 2nd shift... very outgoing people.. UPS drivers always had stories... Co-workers were very colorful characters... always cracking jokes... made it easy to go in ... and spend 8 hours .. the hardest part of the job is that I had second shift and left my kids to be looked out at night... Working with UPS Drivers and my boss... celebrations of birthdays... with BBQ and cake... they all made us feel like we were family ...
good,"Enjoyed working with UPS and very comfortable environment to work in. willing to work for UPS again, other than that hoping to get a job soon ASAP with the excellent experience i have gained from UPS."
good,Ups is a good company whit a good benefits. The contract is a part time and this form we work more efficient and faster. I lerned a lot forms of secury how (8 keys lifting/loading & 5 keys to prevent slips and falls).
good,"One of the few jobs where someone with just a high school education can receive this level of pay and benefits. May have to work odd hours early on, but your options improve as you gain seniority. Loader and package driver positions are physically demanding, but I always looked at it as getting paid to work out."
good,"When arriving at work I first check in at the gate with the security guard. As soon as I get clearance I am then escorted into UPS ""hub"". I find my way to the main office and then I am given my route for the day and driver that I'm with. Nevertheless we then make our way to the delivery trucks and are off onto route. One thing I learned from this job is professionalism. As far as handling packages and presenting myself in public. This company taught me how to represent myself with confidence. The management was and is very professional. There is a steady and flowing system with UPS, packages coming in everyday with everyone doing their given tasks. My co-workers treated me well and gave me good tips on the field as far as working equipment, daily routines and what not. The hardest part of the job I would say would be the time stress, being on time working around daily traffic. I would say the most enjoyable part of this job was running packages to different addresses on the same street."
good,"Working with UPS was one of the most positive experiences in my career. People are very professional, driven, smart, and easy to get along with."
good,"i mostly packaged gifts and other various things to be shipped out t were ever the perso wanted it sent to, it also called for e to keep things in the front of the store nd as well the back stocked up"
good,Go for it if you are ready to work and earn good wages. Receive good benefits and vacation pay as well as opportunity to advance.
good,"It is a great place for developing your sales skills, the managers and trainers are great and care about you advancement."
good,"A typical work day was properly packing packages to be shipped,and locating mail in p.o. boxes. I learned about shipping miscellaneous objects around the world.I enjoyed working with my coworkers because I enjoy the team work. The hardest part of the job was when  we would lose a package through transit.The most enjoyable part of the job was when we would have package donations for our troops."
good,"I loved working at UPS, the only complaint I have about working there would be the hours. I tried to get full-time hours and they were not available at the time, so I had to leave to find a new job."
good,a typical day at work consisted of delivering packages and walking them to the door.I learned what its like to be a ups delivery person and the average day of the driver
good,"A typical day at UPS is unpredictable and can change at any moment based on how the day progresses. You must be able to adapt to all situations. Working within a large hub I interact with over 300 employees daily. I have learned that with 300 people, you have 300 different personalities that you have to adjust to in order to be productive. Being a management employee puts a large amount of responsibility on my shoulders but it is a position in which I thrive. With so many employees under one roof, I find it impressive that so many single parts come together towards an ultimate goal daily. As you would imagine, some days are smoother than others but the job always gets done. The hardest part of the job is managing so many people on a daily basis and making sure every area is staffed and ready to go on time. There is a process in place to make sure we always get the staffing needed but up until the sort starts and can become a bit tricky. The best part of my job is the people. So many employees coming together to accomplish one goal daily."
good,"Working in every type of weather situation, packages were to be delivered. Working as a team of efficient individuals we handle the workday as a breeze. Lifting packages as heavy as 150lbs as a team lift or as heavy as 75lbs by yourself. Management was on point, stuck to the task at hand and figured out the problem. Hardest part of the job is waking up so early."
good,"very hard work starting off, very physically demanding job. great pay and benefits, guarantied hours. job tasks are pretty simple intel you move up than it gets a little more complicated, but nothing to challenging."
good,"load unloading a truck trailer of thousand packages of clothes, electronics and furniture. All Business and department stores contract UPS on a daily basic. Management operates each section of the hub center to ship out as much production as possible and often times harsh towards the section of there employees, to further more production in the building for on time shipments. Depending on the climate of staffing and production in the building, most co workers don't motivate each other to found solutions to complete the job. Keeping your body hydrated and having a lot of energy to lift and load packages that weigh over 60 pounds. Using my employee badge to gain discount from store retailors."
good,"UPS is an absolute amazing place to work. I learned how to organize in a quick and sense able fashion. If you can handle the most basic instructions and have the a moderate understanding of numerical order you can learn this job quick. The hardest part of this job is keeping up with the line during peek season, and making sure you put the proper parcel in the corresponding truck. Multi-tasking is key! UPS pays at higher rate than almost any entry level job, and even at part time, you can receive full time benefits. Amazing I know. Management at the Tri-City location in Westville,IN are friendly and outgoing. The culture of the job varies and is a great atmosphere. Young and old come together to allow all sorts of intriguing conversation. Job security is easy to achieve by joining the Union. This is absolutely a dream job."
good,"UPS taught me to use my hands, how to prepare my body for work and I lost 30 lbs while there. Working here also taught me time management. We worked on strict deadlines which taught me to focus on efficiency."
good,"From the short time I spend there during the seasonal work period, I found it to be a fast pace work environment because the amount of packages to be delivered. I found it to be fun and exciting because you are out among the public and people truly respects the job you are doing, appreciating getting their packages on time. And working with the Drivers you are assigned too is also fun, because of the appreciate the help and ensure you taken care of when you work with them. So it is a place I highly recommend for employment."
good,They gave me plenty of options to make sure I'm most comfortable with my work surroundings. They give the bitter most respect for eah and every one of their employees.
good,I had a great time at UPS. Management loved to teach new skills. Loved helping the customers that came in with their shipping and receiving needs.
good,"I took the UPS Job in hopes of acquiring a better job, after the holidays - Package Handler, Sorter, etc.   My job consisted of riding along with a Parcel Delivery driver and assisting him with package delivery - during the Christmas rush."
good,it was fun working with great people and the hard and long hours every day u when to a different place and meant excellent people. we work as a team
good,"Global Accounting headquarter in DFW area, office is not too big but feels like family. People that works with is very friendly and nice, always see smiles when you walk around. But the building was used to a grocery store building so we are not able to have our own windows, only manager office in front of building has window in the office. "

good,"It is a nice fast pace environment where everybody knows what to do and try to run the place on time. I started as a package sorter and now I am scanning packages.  everybody gets along in the work area.  The hardest part of the job is handling the heavy boxes which can be up to 70 pounds and what I like about the job is how fast everything happens, you do not get to realize about time."
good,I would love to be employed with UPS.  Their company cares about their employees & their families.  The compensation & work hours are desirable.
good,"Managers were very understanding and would go out of there way to make sure you were in a safe work environment and healthy (during summer they would hand out cold water bottles to keep you cool and hydrated.)"
good,"i have nothing much ton say about this job. i unloaded trucks, thats all there is to it. but it was tiring. there is nothing else other than the management was good."
good,"There was no slowing down here, which is a good thing.  You were usually tired by the end of the day which means you put in a good day's work."
good,Typically supervise 12 workers. Great coworkers to work alongside. Management has its perks but not at all times. Hardest part of the job is depending on loaders to show up. The most enjoyable part of the job is watching your work pay off in the operation.
good,I learned about ship and how a warehouse and trucking company runs. Handling packaging and checking labels and area codes and zip codes. Also learned about caring customer product with care. I learned how work conyor belts also how to sort mail.
good,Fast pace and always busy which is nice. There is always plenty of work to do that makes the day go by quickly. Compensation is more than adequate.
good,"I come in ,"
good,I really enjoyed enjoyed working for UPS.  A fair days pay for a hard days work.  If you stay at UPS for at least five years you can move up  quickly if you show interest in doing so.
good,Received orders and unloaded packages from planes and warehouse and stored them properly in trailers. Although many packages were not heavy it was a great idea for supervisors to hold short exercise sessions before work so we wouldn't pull muscles or get cramping in any parts of our body.
good,Fast pace environment.  Warehouse environment so very hot in summer and very cold in winter.  Mass volume of packages.  Holidays have the most volume.  You work everyday of the week.
good,"There no easy way around this one. On the sunrise we have to preform early every morning. Our business model is one that has no room for error or not time sensitive, so its up to the team effort we put forth daily. Sign here please...."
good,"A typical day at work is just as if your going to the gym, from when you clock in and  stretch out. Processing all of the outbound mail to be sent to their destinations. Ive learned safe work methods, and proper lifting skills. Management is on point with trying to make things right, and as a UPS worker your covered under union. Hardest part of the job i will say is peak season. Christmas is always a bust as soon as halloween volume numbers start to pick up in deliveries to outbound mail because everyone starts to do more shopping and early christmas shopping."
good,"A UPs foi um empresa da qual agregou muito em meu aprendizado profissional pude exercer um pouco mais a fundo sobre todo o processo da logística, oportunizando a diversas experiencias e até na resolução de problemas. "
good,"When out of the load center, a delivery driver is on his own to ensure the delivery vehicle is emptied in a timely fashion. Further, that parcel pick up and return to the center is completed as well."
good,On the daily i took on incoming calls from the customer with questions concerning the packages and deliveries.  Whenever i was in doubt about anything other co-workers there were quickly to assist in a positive manner .
good,"Working for UPS was non stop, hard, physical work which was well worth it. I enjoyed my time being employed there. The hardest part was lifting the heavy packages onto the delivery trucks."

good,"Split schift, start early morning and fininsh morning:) back home a university and afternoon start all over again.  "
good,"Easy Long Day At Work"
good,It's a PT job that handles business in 3-4 hours.  Plane comes in from East Coast and we would sort out at least 3 planes. I've learned how to read zip codes and where their destinations are. Managers and Supervisors are great to work with especially when everyone is on the same page.  Co-workers are fun to be with ...we always have fun working. Hardest part of the job is carrying overweight packages (usually anything more than 70 lbs).  It's also fast paced and when things go way to fast to sort ...it gives me and my other sorters pressure but in the end everything gets sorted and we finish on time (sometimes earlier than our actual downtime).  We know each other well enough to have so much fun.  We have a continuous group and there's not much turnover once you are in.
good,A typical workplace consists of packing and loading trucks of shipments. I learned how to safely carry a large item and how to package objects. The management wasn't assertive or task oriented. My coworkers were friendly and very helpful. The hardest part of the job was the tasks could never be completed because the shipments were never ending. The enjoyable part of the job was the breaks.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job for me was delivering packages and working along side UPS drivers. A typical day for me here would be clocking in at 3am. Working in the warehouse until about 6am and    working as a Driver Helper by 2pm if I would receive a call.
good,"A typical day at work includes, arriving and setting up loads, and then, simply, loading trailers with packages. I learned that processes and following directions is important in order to be successful. Management is great, co-workers are even better. Hardest part of the job is the physical labor and the most enjoyable part is the recognition of success."
good,"Every day is a new challenge.  It is a fast, stressful, and exciting job.  UPS loves to promote within so lots of room to grow in the company."
good,"Assign, train and supervise sorters in all aspects of package distribution. Ensuring a safe work environment and keeping track of hourly payroll needs."
good,At this job being apart of a team was very important. We as a whole had to not only move furniture for customers but also at times set it up and arrange to thier liking. Even if the team was not needed we all were there to help.
good,A typical workday would include stretching before entering the work area. Loading and unloading trucks. Sorting and scanning packages to be sent to there correct destination.
good,"A typical day at UPS is filled with physical activity.  There's little downtime which makes the day fly by.  Supervisors are respectful and allow you to do your job with minimal interference."
good,"I highly enjoyed working for this company. If it wasn't for my college schedule,  would have stayed much longer and tried to advance within the company. Staffing was the only issue."
good,"U.P.S is a great company to work for ,great benefits ."
good,"My typical first work day of working the break and outbound of a convention would be the travel driving to the convention site which would usuallly be out of town! I was one of the regional tradeshow coordinators for the midwest region, so i had to make sure they would have a certain amount of empty trailers a the dock doors, a driver schedulled to arrive at a certain time to drop an empty trailer, hook to a loaded trailer, then start to bring them back to the terminal! I would talk to the exhibitors, help them select the services needed and process the paperwork! I would be there two to three days in order to clear out the convention center!"
good,"Only worked part time but enjoyed work for the most part, majority of people in the area were pleasant and management was willing to work with you with scheduling."
good,I love the co-workers on the MOD. They were a lot of fun through the good and bad days. Everybody was willing to give a helping hand and cared personally and professionally about each other. I miss those guys.
good,"I would pack boxes for customers and would call mailbox holders for renewal.  I learned that I'm stronger than I look and can pack various items in different sizes of boxes.  My boss was always encouraging, supportive and always tried to match our class time with work hours.  My co-workers were hard workers but sometimes it would get crowded behind the work area.  The hardest part was leaving and sometimes my manager would not help when needed.  The most enjoyable was learning a new skill, the friendly customers that came in and Christmas bonus."
good,This is a good seasonal position. I was trained and never worked but you have paid training. This is a decent job. I never had the chance to gain any skills because I never worked.
good,"Although work/life balance can be tricky, it is a fantastic company to work for. You are compensated very well, and have infinite opportunities to advance and have a long, stable career."
good,colleagues are friendly and go with the flow. Management are strict in a sense we can learn how to budget time with work and after work.
good,"After working with UPS all I want to do is go back to UPS. I learned so much about myself and UPS procedures just by working for this company for a month. Everyone is real positive and out going, and the managers are all about safety and numbers. I never did anything hard during my time with UPS it was overall an enjoyable experience and I was sad I was only a seasonal employee."
good,"It was a team player job, very friendly and comfortable job. It was early a.m. hours but went by quick. Great pay and benefits."
good,"a typical day at work is come in one time, attend presort meeting and from there i start sorting packages for an unloader. i sort fbetween 4-6 hours every shift. the most enjoyable part of work is the 10 minute break. the hardest part of work is to keep pushing yourself . I love my job and my co workers make it very enjoyable in which makes time move fast. i learned a lot about the company and how it operates."
good,Loved my boss. Great schedule and boss was very understanding. Coworkers were amazing. They were more like family. I didn't have a hard part to my job.
good,"its not the easiest job in the world, but it builds team work friends and career opportunities, a typical day is no time for waiting talking or clowning got  to get to get to business, on the belts if your not working as a time its not going to work, the hardest part is staying focused for so long till the job is done"
good,"Working for USPS was a great experience for me. when the shift started i would be brief by the manager and other co-workers, we would discuss the expected work load of the night. Once the work night started it was a non-stop flow of boxes and packages. In some instanced i was directed to assist other co-workers since they had a heavier work load. During my time at UPS i was part of a great team, this help me increase my teamwork experience."
good,"Stretch "
good,"Honestly, I love working for UPS. It is a great company with a lot of room to grow. It is mostly physical labor unless you are management."
good,I loved working for this company my time there was a fun one and I would love to return and work for my supervisor. Everyday that I came to work I enjoyed walking through the door to go to work with my co workers and my supervisors
good,Typical day is delivering 150 to 180 stops its good for the pay but supervisors have a hard to find a solutions to lil problems and it escalates quick but If you like working by yourself with no one breathing down your back its the perfect job
good,Excellent opportunity to make a honest living. This company is big on union so thats a big plus!!! I would prefer this job to my friends and family members.
good,UPS is an awesome company. You need to be somewhat physically fit due to running packages to the locations in a timely fashion. Really good to try to get on full time with the great benefits that are offered.
good,over all shipping to all locations and the united states.  to be able to adapt to change.  will to listen to new ideas.  had a strong work ethic with employees.  to complete orders with absentees.  to complete all orders given out by management.
good,"Working out in the cold this time of year is no fun but as seasons change it gets better. A typical day lasts 3 and a half hours. Just doing same thing over and over each day. "
good,Not easy to work at UPS but as you do you see how much you can handle and deal with very quickly which is great
good,"Continuous orders to complete, always kept me busy. Enjoyable and productive people to work with. Approachable management with superior work ethic. Was hoping there would be more work hours provided."
good,"A typical day at work is to make sure you greet the customer with a smile and listen to their needs. Their needs can be just a few simple prints to customized two big boxes together to fit their item. This fast pace business has taught me to how to be creative and improved on my customer service skills. It has also taught me how to make decisions on my own or work as a team player. I've supervised four staff and has helped each one to solved issue or find ways to improved to meet customer satisfaction. Most importantly, is to be well organized in a work environment and be self motivated. The hardest part of the job is to make sure all jobs ordered are completed on time. The most enjoyable part of the job is customer satisfaction."
good,"very fast pace, teamwork is key, a lot of lifting was involved with this job"
good,Entry level position during the summer before returning to school in the fall.
good,"Arrive early get set up . Motivate employee's and let them know the task at hand for the days volume and previous days misloads and statistics of their personal productiobn goals . My management team is helpful in showing and allowing personal growth within the company . My motto is ""Once a task has begun .. never leave until it's done ... be the task great or small ... do it well or not all "" . I think I just love to work !"
good,I would go into work after school and spend the remainder of the day. The management was great and very helpful``
good,Set up trucks for package delivery. Loaded 17 to 25 packages per min. Scanned packages for tracking purposes.
good,"Great place to work! Just not enough hours.                                                                                           "
good,"Un día normal es trabajar con un volumen alto de paquetes y hacer un buen despacho para ofrecerle el mejor  servicio a los clientes. He aprendido a trabajar con diferentes situaciones que hay que resolver al instante para que el día sea efectivo y productivo. Relacionado a la gerecia todos somos personas muy competentes y enfocados en nuestras labores diarias, al igual que los demas  empleados que son personas que dan cada dia el cien porciento para que el servicio sea uno de exelencia. Lo mas díficil es la planificación de cada día ya que todo el volumen llega a nosotros por avión y dependemos de otras circustancias como: personas, clima, etc. Lo mas que me gusta de mi trabajo es el reto, que temos día a día para que la operación sea fructifera, y para que todo salga eficientemente."
good,I really enjoy my job at the UPS MKE Gateway. I have learned so much working here. I am trained and certified in many aspects of shipping/receiving via air cargo. My management team is very friendly and apply positive team work. They are also very family orientated. Safety and Family first! I'd have to say that the hardest and most enjoyable part of my job are one in the same. My job involves quite a lot of multitasking in a extremely time sensitive manner. You have to be very organized and detail- oriented for this position.
good,"Very fast pace.  0 to 100 until break time and then right to a 100 after break until the job is done.  Management is under until job is done.  It is like what supervisor told me a long time ago.  What happens at work, stays at work and when the job is all is forgiven.  Most coworkers just want to finish the job and go home.  Hardest part of the job is the time table that must maintain.  The best part of job is going home at end day."
good,"team players"
good,Loading trucks and driving for delivery. Management and co-workers were awesome. Hard part was time. Mostly enjoyed completing task on time and safely.
good,"UPS is a very organized, well-rooted, and historical company. A typical day in the Indistrial Engineering department included analyzing data, deciphering code, problems solving, and a lot of email correspondence with higher level managers. Working in I.E., I learned a lot about logistics and importance of efficiency. I learned how to look at data and extract meaningful value in order to increase this efficiency. My coworkers were very professional, helpful, and fun to work with. They were all very supportive in my education about the industry during my time at UPS, which made the experience in I.E. even more valuable to my skillset as a business professional."
good,"Attend pre-sort supervisor's meeting, this is where the shifts volume is revealed, tasks are assigned, errors are reviewed, questions and concerns are addressed. Inspection of work area is conducted, written report filled out as to the work conditions. I deliver a Pre-Work Communication, this can be a multitude of topics but generally consist of a safety tip, a wellness tip, a review of the day before; the day's volume, goals, expectations are discussed and then we limber up through stretching. Assign work areas and process packages until we are done. I log employee times, trailer departures, volume, safety requirements, observe operations, make vital business decisions regarding monetary benefits, while taking into consideration at all times the effects that our quality and timeliness of work will have on internal and external customers alike. The hardest part of my job is negotiating employee objectives, goals, and personal issues with those of company objectives, goals and issues. The most enjoyable part of my job is the successful negotiation of employee and company objectives, goals and issues on a daily basis."
good,"UPS provides great benefits, and incentives"
good,"UPS was a great experience, overall great company. A company that truly took care of its employees, monthly cookouts, and provided the necessary items to aid during the job hours. Ex: During summer, when it was too hot in the warehouse, they would provide us with water, gatorade and fruit to keep us cool and focused. When winter came, hot chocolate and coffee was provided to stay warm, and heaters throughout the warehouse."
good,"This company evolved from an East to West Coast company to world wide. I started with a clip board and ended with a satelite linked computer.  We were supported with all the technology, yet customer service was always at the forefront.  I delivered and picked up from residences and business and had to be an independent thinker in the field. The management put pressure to be fast, efficient, and safe on the road. We were required to learn safety, technology, hazmat requirements and it was constantly changing. In my last year I drove the Next Day Air Container shuttle to the Oakland Airport, which required a high level FBI clearance to attain access to the airport runways. I stayed with UPS 7 years past my retirement elegibility simply I loved my job, my customers and my co-workers.  The job kept me in good shape and physically and mentally active."
good,Excellent company to work for. Over all company not good with employee recognition
good,Working at UPS was overall a great experience and sometimes a bit challenging!
good,"Sort boxes for stops along the way."
good,"enjoy working for them, great employees and just a place to work at"
good,I loved working for UPS! I loved being on the truck riding around town and constantly meeting new people. It was definitely one of the best experiences of my life.
good,A typical day will consist of a lot mail to process in not a certain time limit. Management try to make it fun and the co workers are nice and funny. The hardest park is peek season when ton and tons mail has to be process. The best part is the money.
good,the work environment is very fast paced and hot but once you get use to the environment its not as hard as it seems.
good,"Staff is great understanding, theres a 1 raise every 3 months, they show you the ropes"
good,"This is the first UPS store that I've came across that has offered full-time positions, health benefits, and a 401(k) plan. Great environment."
good,"*Good days at work"
good,The team would work together as quickly and efficiently as possible to complete the nights operations.
good,"I go into work 30 minutes early to set up my work station and check the air can's for cracks and missing rivets. I learned a lot about the Air Dock, how to log in Hazards Materials in the Manifest sheet.My co-workers are great we worked as a team during peak season,which can be very demanding on the body and mind. I love the challenge that United Parcel Service gives. The most enjoyable part of the the job, you get a awesome work out and great benefits, and able to work your way to the top."
good,"loading and unloader packages, working in a friendly environment. having supervisor believe in your abblites"
good,"Great company to start entry level and stay with long term. Hours vary but the work is union and can come with security, management positions available for those who want them."
good,Get to work set up my area and see what loads I have for that day. I learned about logistic and how it works. I also receive management training while I was there. Management was good they work with you to make sure you learn what you need to know to run a smooth operation. My co-workers was good. I had some that call in a lot and I had a lot of co-workers that came to work ready everyday. We worked as a team everyday. The hardest part of the job  was around peak season when the volume of packages pick up. I enjoyed going to work everyday and I really like working for this company.
good,"fast paced , great management, enjoyable, hardest part about job is the weather"
good,"The UPS Store is a great place for anyone to work. The co-workers are great to work with, and management is amazing. Overall, a very nice place to be employed."
good,"As a package handler you are expected to have a high level of attentiveness, punctuality and quickness. After setting up your work area you work for 5+ hours in a fast paced, high pressure situation. If you thrive while under pressure this might be the position for you. Personally, I enjoyed the feeling of building a really good load for the drivers and enjoyed seeing my improvement as time went on. This is NOT an easy job,it isn't laid back and when they mean fast paced it means fast paced. You will lose weight, you will gain muscle, you will be in the best shape of your life. The crew is a family, most coworkers are happy to help someone out whose struggling as long as you return the favor. If you start working during November good luck, thats peak season, expect 12 hour ""days"", with possibilities for overtime. I would go back there in a second."
good,"I do the weight and balance for two to three aircraft daily.  This is computer work where I place the containers with certain weights in locations throughout the aircraft to make it fly most efficiently."
good,"UPS was a fast paced hard working environment. Trailers were unloaded in under an hour, which meant unloaders had to work hard and fast to stay on pace. I enjoyed the challenge of unloading the trailers in a certain time frame and I got back into shape quickly in the process. I started working as holiday help riding in the truck during the day and unloading trailers through the night and early morning. UPS decided to hire me to unload trailers after the holidays ended. The hardest part of the job was unloading tires and other material over 70 lbs. The pay and benefits are very good at UPS, but the hours for unloaders were around 5 hours a night. This was not enough money to live on. I cannot say enough about how nice the other workers were at this UPS facility. I got along with everyone and made some new friends. I was surprised when they threw a party in my honor when it was time for me to move on."
good,"Since my employment at UPS I have had the opportunity to learn the full circle process accross 3 shifts that all opporate differently. The more I know and learn make me a more valuable employee. I am considered a runner. Meaning I can move from one job to a nother, without instruction. And manangement is already looking at my skills and resume to get me further in the company."
good,"Management was very understanding and always worked with you. Very good union, shop steward always on site. Everybody worked with each to get the job done."
good,"I come in early in the morning at about 3 am. I usually load packages off of a conveyor belt into UPS trucks, sometimes I unload packages off of a trailer onto a conveyor belt so they can be loaded into the UPS trucks. There is a position called the package distribution center which everyone considers the hardest position they only put 3 people there including me because no one else can ""handle it"". I have definitely learned a lot from UPS including how to come in and be motivated to work and have a fun time at work while working and motivating others to work and have fun. I have learned how to work a lot harder and quicker with how many packages UPS delivers. I am in the process of becoming a driver so I have learned how to drive a delivery truck, how to drive stick and how to drive more safely. I would say the most enjoyable part is coming in and knowing that UPS actually does value me as part of the company by giving me opportunities to move up in the company ladder and letting me know how good I do every day,"
good,"It was hard work, but I enjoyed going to work every day. There was alot of turn over in supervisors"
good,"great company with thrilling worklist"
good,load city delivery trucks in organized timed matter. learned to be a faster worker and time management. enjoyable part of job was being busy.
good,"I typically worked 5 hour shifts and enjoyed coming into work. I liked the guys I worked with and it was a very enjoyable environment. With all retail, it gets stressful at times but that comes with the job."

good,"When I signed up to be a driver's assistant temporarily I had no idea what to expect. I had a bit of an advantage although, my driver was my dad, but I did not want to take my advantage likely. This job opened my eye with the new experience of hard work. I was used to hard work from my wrestling practice every day, yet this was different because I was semi-outside. Some harsh conditions could not be compared to anything but another job that takes place out doors. I would meet my dad at one of his stops, depending on how far he had gotten that day, and help him by taking the packages to the door. At first having the recipients sign was awkward can time consuming. I learned to not ask them to spell their name when I type it into the equipment, because it was time consuming. I found that there were two section of my dad's route, the business section, and the residential section. I enjoyed the residential section because it was the harder of the two. There were lots of stops in the residential  area and I ended up carrying speed walking a lot. Wearing all the layers that I had been, I was sweating the entire time. Every day I would wear less layers because I wanted to be less miserable. I got a good pattern down, every time he would stop, I would hop out, and he would hand me either the packages and, or the hand truck, and point me to which place I need to deliver at. Some days we would finish early and help other driver's by taking a chunk of packages that they have delivering it ourselves."
good,"The day went by fast, because of the fast pace work.  It was seasonal job,but will love to work part time. My hardest part of the hardest part of the job was dealing with tt be in the dogs that might be in the area. I love the job, like meeting new people."

good,"A typical work-day started with organizing and prioritizing packages for delivery.  The delivery truck would then be positioned at a centralized location for a delivery area, and packages would be delivered expeditiously to recipients at commercial and residential locations.  I was then expected to transfer the package politely, and handle client requests and concerns while maintaining company standards and image."
good,"Started working at night, loaded trucks for 4-6 hours a night. after/as my daughter was born, i put in for a transfer to days for a better sleep schedule and got it before i was even back from vacation.  Stayed till i was downsized/laid off."
good,"good place to work with flexible hours, great benefits, great pay"

good,"During my career at UPS, I did many different jobs. Each job had it's own role in the company, and each one was a great way to learn new things. When I first started, my typical day was unloading and reloading aircrafts to move packages throughout the system. Later I was taught the city of Miami with all of its streets, so that I could dispatch drivers to pickup orders that we had received. Later, I worked in the Finance and Accounting department, where, I did record retention, mail services, and Accounting for fuel and oil which included fuel drops, fuel usage, vehicle tag and registrations, Fuel card monitoring for fraud. I worked with many people and they were all good people. I had managers that I could talk to and worked well with them. The hardest part of my job was when they downsized the first time and had to do 3 full time jobs in part time hours. I learned a lot from the many different positions and I felt that I accomplished a lot by attaining different types of knowledge."
good,"es una empresa que cuida a sus operarios a lo cual estos responden con mas sacrificio en sus tareas"
good,"While working under UPS I learned unity, partnership and success."
good,Buena  trato esquisito  los compañeros buenos los jefes buenos
good,A day at work would be lifting boxes and deliver the packages to customers on time  the difficult part of three job is the weather especially when it is raining and snowing  and pushing the hand truck up the hill
good,stacking and loading product on trucks i think its a growing bussiness anda oppurinaty for me to work for
good,I loved working there the only reason I left is that I couldn't wait 8 years for a full time position
good,Dynamic and fast-paced working environment and many different tasks throughout the day. Learned many valuable skills to handle packages and assist customers. Co-workers have positive attitude. Hardest part of the job is assisting multiple customers at a time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the variety of work.
good,"Caring management allowing for flexibility when needed.  Challenging career that allows for new learning experiences almost daily.  Thankless at times, and other times extremely rewarding.  A company you can be proud to be associated with."
good,"At UPS, I had the responsibilities of starting the day, waking up as early as 2:00 AM. Start times of the week varied as the volumes of packages did, so being punctual and knowledgeable of incoming volume was a must. WIth my time at UPS I learned to safely unload, move, load, sort, and deliver packages for customers. Safety was the number one priority for my supervisors and they truly looked out for me. My co-workers also were all friendly and easy to work with. Everyone had a great work ethic and would come together to accomplish our daily tasked as a team. Everyday at work, except on Mondays, the UPS Air freight would arrive towards the end of the shift. As the new employee, everyone looked towards me to do the job nobody else wanted to do. The reason the ""air"", as we called it was so hard, was mainly because of the unloading of the capsules were tough. The capsules were filled with high volume and or many overweight packages, (70 lbs +) and the capsule itself was a mere 4 ft in height causing the unloader to move many heavy items in a small space at a fast pace. Even though there were tough times, the best part of the day came around 7:30 AM when everything has been unloaded. Finishing the shift with the loading of packages and sending bags of mail down the belt, I truly got my first break at work and soon after departed towards home feeling accomplishment."
good,"Good management, although they get stressed. I've learned a lot about how shipping companies work. My coworkers are great! And obviously, those killer UPS benefits rock."

good,UPS was a great job to help me gain experience with my communication experience and customer service skills.
good,This out of every job I have had has to be my favorite. I love the environment. My typical day includes starting off the night having a meeting. Then I go down to ballmat. Ballmatting is where the cans are unloaded that come out of the airplanes. I bay them in and out of the belt where they are unloaded at. After ballmatting I then go out to the scale house and weigh up the cans after they are filled to go out to the airplanes. Making sure everything is correct on the manifest is correct is crucial.
good,"I have worked at UPS nearly 6 years and have never had a problem with them, and vice versa.  The management team is great and the job is secure.  Most co-workers are easy to get along with and most of them take pride in what they do.  The hardest part of the job is the strain on my back from lifting heavy packages for 4 hours straight.  The most enjoyable part is management lets us talk amongst the co-workers as long as the work is being perform efficiently."
good,UPS will teach you to multitask in a fast paced in a time oriented environment while maintaining  extremely safe working habits.
good,"The best place I have ever work in my life, great boss and fun co-workers. If I didn't have to move I would still be working there."
good,"I was a Loader then moved to night shift and became a shifter, I learned the values of hard work and i loved how the management worked. All my co workers were awesome and all very different and fun. The hardest part was the labor, sometimes it got too hot to want to move but I always pushed through it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom of being who you are at work and getting to make new friends"
good,"Key responsibilities in servicing customers and coordinating the center's administrative activities "

good,going in at night get my instructions on what i am suppose to do then heasd to my forklift or the truck that i help in either loading or unloading 
good,"Great company to work with. You come in, clock in, wait for instructor to tell you your trailer number, get in, turn on the extendo belt, and start unloading. What I've learned from being there is a lot. You learn safety methods, tools and equipment, how to properly handle a package, team work,  and many more. Management is great for the most part. You have your typical know-it-all boss who is all about work and no play. Most Supervisors are laid back and love to talk and same with the co-workers. I've made a few friends and they have a lot of stories to tell. Hardest part of the job, to me, would be the labor itself. You have ireg's (irregular packages) that are heavy and hard to deal with. Most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers for sure. Great, happy, loud, people. Super nice and generous. "
good,A typical day at work was exciting to me. It was very easy to learn other areas of the warehouse to move up. Management was helpful when needed. My co-workers made it fun while still working. The hardest part of the job was nothing at all. The most enjoyable part of the job was having it itself. I miss working for UPS.
good,Really liked working for UPS. Hard job sometimes but most of the time very fast-paced and time went by fast and it was enjoyable being constantly on the move.
good,"I loved this job. Everyday I would meet with my assigned driver and help him/her with the deliveries for the day. All of my drivers were phenomenal and so supportive in every way. I learned that there are so many nice people in the area that I live in. The hardest part of the job was to work in the rain and cold, since the van didn't have a passenger door it would get extremely cold at times, however I didn't mind it. The best part of the job was working with the drivers, they were all such great people and I'll never forget my experience there. "
good,"At UPS, people trust the people they work for, take pride in what they do, enjoy the people they work with, and serve the communities in which they live. The environment has been praised as one of the most open and receptive."
good,I really do not have nothing to say about this company besides that they are awesome at what they do.
good,"I worked the overnight shift."
good,"UPS is a great company that takes care of your family. You are able to advance as long as you do what you are supposed to do, when you are supposed to do it."
good,"Typical work day starts with walk thru of my work area, ensuring the work area and equipment are safe for employee use. Brief pre-sort meeting to review previous day results and the day's plan. After the meeting I lead my employees in upholding the highest standards of safety, production, and quality throughout the work day. Finally, after the work area is wrapped and prepared for the next shift I pay all my employees."
good,UPS makes a distince effort to start each and every work day with a smile. Working at this particular location included morning coffee and a daily chat with an excellent crew and manager! There was never a day I wasn't pleased to go to work and interact with such excellent and happy customers along with a hard-working and organized crew!
good,A typical day at UPS I work night shift start time varies every week from start time being 10:00 to 10:30 range. I rarely get 5 hours a day on average its a 3 hours a day job. It all depends on how many packages we are expecting or if a flight is on time or delayed. During holidays they call it Peak Season and you can go from a 3 hour normal day to a 12 hour overtime day with a double shift you can sign up for just for peak season. Overall UPS makes you work for your money lifting packages as heavy as 70 pounds by yourself at a moderate pace. I would have to say the hardest part is lifting bulk which are the 70 pound to 95 range pound range. I love my job because I love the hours and feel like I get a work out everyday. Management overall is fair I haven't had any negative attention although I have seen other supervisors argue which I find to be unprofessional. Overall you will find very likable supervisors.
good,la pasas bien con todos haciedo un gran equipo y dar a conocer como la mejor del mundo
good,A busy day having to manage a whole facility of 30 employees.
good,Loading and unloading packages. Co-workers usually keep to themselves. The hardest part of the job was probably loading a truck by myself.
good,"I was working here for 3 weeks during the holiday rush in December. It was very intertaining for a job. Very simple: ride with the driver, scan the packages to be delivered, get signature if needed, and return. I liked it because I had someone there very experienced to ask help if needed and to talk to. Unfortunately, it was only holiday help."
good,Work was always busy and I had to learn how to use their DIAD board along with organizing the truck so that we can deliver the packages fast and efficiently. Management was good and my co-workers were nice people that would help other drivers if they finished their routes early. The hardest part was leaving packages at houses that had locked gated fences and the easiest part was having the customer thank you for delivering their package.
good,"Great experience, very low salary cap. Little to no incentive for management to go above and beyond."
good,"Go into work everyone is always in a great mood. I learned what to do and not to when lifting items. Management team was the best, they all worked together to make it a freandly enviorment. My hardest part of the job was trying to keep roller clear. My most enjoyable part of the job is going in and everyone is in a great mood."
good,"I’m a passionate, optimistic & dedicated woman who takes up responsibilities with utmost enthusiasm and see to it that I complete my tasks and assignments in time.

The hardest part of the job for me was when I first started i had to unload the trucks, I never worked that hard before. The most enjoyable part was when i became a voicer for the unloaders of the trucks."
good,"My years at United Parcel Service were perhaps the best years of my working life. At UPS, I wasn't just employed there; I was *valued* and openly appreciated for my efforts to provide superior service. I was treated like a member of the family, the UPS family."
good,A typical day at work for me is going in and the first thing I do is mentor the new hires and then I make sure my safety board is up to date. Then I go to my regular job on the load lines Picking boxes off of the belt and scanning/loading them into the correct trailers. I have learned hard work ethic at this job more than anything. Management is great but I am able to do my job with minimal supervision. My co-workers work hard and do their job as they are told to be done. The hardest part of my job is loading packages. The most enjoyable part of my job is the environment and the people in it.

I was first hired as Christmas help and then I was laid off because the holiday rush was over. I was so happy when I was called back to work there, because I had such plans to go to college and everything was set. Then because they had two employees coming back from medical reasons, that did not leave any room for me, so I was laid off again. I would love to go back and work for them again.

good,Loved it very well environment kept me goin everyday the boss the coworkers every one is coo people they have you in a zone and to be so young they all took me in
good,A typical day at UPS is unloading the docks and trucks onto the conveyor belt which flows to the sorters. I learned a lot of safety on how to moved boxes safely and learned the importance of keeping myself safe and hydrated. The hardest part about the job is dealing with the heavy boxes over 70+ lbs because we had to put the box on the belt and walk it to the irregular shoot. The most enjoyable part of the job is the paste of keeping the boxes flowing. I think work goes by soo much faster while working at a fast paste.
good,It was a pleasure to work with UPS.  The workplace was great ! A lot of enthusiasm and team work. The process was efficient making the day to day activities smooth.
good,I have enjoyed the work. Everyday is different and the satisfaction knowing the customers are happy is a great thing. The employees are very supportive.

good,"There is always something to do, and if you’re not doing anything the you’re clearly doing something wrong. Not only does UPS have a fair pay, but the benefits are amazing and it calls helps build character. it shows you to be independent and to work your best at all times."
good,The best learning experience at UPS is the learning to load the ups trucks and the fast pace. The team work of the pre loaders and the hours are great.
good,They were really great working for and everyone there is really great with helping you and others like if a task needed more than yourself you could ask someone kissing another truck and they’d come no problem because they still have stuff coming down the belt line like you so it was very high pass and you had to be very precise

good,"At UPS, you're working at a very fast pace but its worth it because you learn so much while being on the job.The hardest part about working at UPS is delivering heavy boxes to houses on a hill. What I've learned about working for UPS is having a sense of urgency and learning the ins and outs about the job on the day to day basis."
good,I have been in UPS a little over a year and I am loving it. It is a physically demanding job but that is what i love. The management is great and the co workers make it fun.
good,"different shifts are available both temporarily and permanently and management is very people orientated.  Duties are clearly defined  and thus easy to see your progress.  "
good,Ups is a great job that feel like a career if your a driver. It comes with great pay and great benefits. Really family oriented but really serious no room for mistakes as A driver.
good,"Seasonal employment, There just wasn’t enough hours but overall I enjoyed the job I wish it was not seasonal but that’s what I had applied for at the time because that’s what they had available at the time"
good,UPS is a great company as a whole. They make their employees feel very welcomed. There is always work that need to be done so your always busy. The work environment is lovely!
good,"UPS is a great company too work for, you have a great pay and easy access to complete task on the job great communication and answers when help need from and supervisor or manager also ."
good,"My first back to the workforce baptism after being a Full-Time Stay-At-Home Dad to 2 kids for a little under 8 years didn't disappoint me as I am even impressed at how I was able to handle and enjoy this awesome experience to see the World from a different perspective, learning new skills and meeting wonderful individuals. Though labor extensive, lots of walking and lifting, I am prepared. It was a pleasure to be given the opportunity to work for this great company."

good,I work as a loader for the United Parcel Service. I really enjoy the benefits and overall camaraderie of my coworkers. Great places to move up within the company.
good,"Get some rest, lol. Don’t apply if you don’t like a fast paced job. Even though it’s relatively easy job, you got to be ready to move. Your called a jumper for a reason, cause as that truck makes it stops, you better be ready to jump out and deliver that package and jump back in and on to the next one. I’ll be back next year to work again, great job in a growing company."

good,I would recommend this company to other people who are seeking opportunity jobs . Good  management and friend working is groups never feel bored. Quick response
good,UPS has a very good corporate training course. Working there is has been great during the time that I worked. The compensation is above most delivery companies. They offer stock options and other benefits that exceed the current industry.
good,My job had a lot of heavy lifting and movie and standing on my feet but it was an awesome experience. The pay was alright it wasn’t enough for what I was doing. But overall it was a good job the people were really nice
good,packaging and  unloading can be very confusing and tiresome. Together our team would pull through our shift meeting quota everyday. the work space was very hot in the trucks we would unload or load.
good,Working for UPS is very fast paced and time goes by quick. The only thing I think UPS could do differently is at the end of the seasonal time they should reach out to some of the seasonal helpers who did a great job and see if they want to stay with UPS full time.
good,with the work that I do with next day air it gets stressful at night because all of the air drivers have certain stops and seem to all come in at once instead of coming in on a designated time frame.
good,I worked for ups for 2 seasons it was awsome the people are cool its fun and it keeps u real busy ......also it gets u strong and u also meet new people everyday

good,I worked well with others and didn't have a problem doing my job of loading the trucks. I also had to unload big heavy packages witch took two people to unload and it was fun.
good,The benefits are great if you are getting them for yourself or family I recommend them. The stock plans are great also you get sick time and paid vacation time off every year.

good,"When it comes to UPS, I never thought that I'd actually end up working for them at all, at least for the second time because I really do like working for them. If anything that I don't like, it's having a seasonal job because I don't like to be unemployed."

good,"Assist the UPS driver with various work related challenges such as delivering packages to customers, loading and unloading the truck, calling clients, communicating with dispatcher, handling customer complaints and keeping the the truck clean and freight organized in a professional manner.

good,I handled the every day tasks well.i enjoyed the people I worked with and having stability.i had kids in Wich I had to seek other jobs due to being seasonal at ups
good,"I’ve worked for UPS every holiday season since 2012 whether it’s performing tasks of Driver Helper or at the warehouse as a PT Sorter. This is the only company I have worked for that is not just family oriented and understanding but also cares. I have never been happy with any corporation that I’ve worked for besides UPS, my family realized I came home so much happier than I have in my past jobs with other companies. UPS has amazing associates, drivers, and managers that are just so understanding as long as you have the key of communication."
good,"Night crew stock clerks inspect shipments, unpack boxes, verify packing slips and track merchandise. They retrieve customer orders and transport products from warehouse storing areas to shelves and store displays."
good,"If you like fast paced night shift work, preloader at UPS is the job for you ! It will also put you in UPS shape ! The pay could perhaps be a little better, but we do have our heavy season's where you'll be working 10- 13 hours a day."
good,"UPS is a good company to work for, has great benefits, flexible schedules, and a great team. Start off at entry level and work your way up the ladder."

good,It's awesome the people are great you get paid weekly and bonuses. Bennifits are amazing . You get to work with different people. Meeting new people everywhere everyday.
good,"Working for UPS I’d say is best around the holiday season for their holiday rush. They hire plenty of people from October to January, preloaders (loading UPS trucks and Uhauls or sorting packages on a conveyor) for 3 different flexible shifts, PVD drivers for day shift starting about 9-10 am anyone with a car & space for boxes willing to drive their car as a driver also getting paid for mileage you will track and report daily. They pay is good starting at 14-18$"

I felt very confident and comfortable with my work area overall let me say management was very friendly and open to personal and work questions...

good,"I didnt like the fact that the breaks were strict for everyone when most of the break time was taken up in walking to the break area. For the pay and cost of living, the job was definitely not worth the labor."
good,"At first going into UPS, i first though i was going to carry HEAVY load but honestly they weren't that heavy. I do work at HomeDepot, so maybe i got a little muscular with them. First walked in a room with everyone with a smile. Everyone treated others with respect. Deerfield Location i like it a lot! I feel i can take on UPS ."

good,The benefits you obtain while at UPS is amazing. I didn't think I would have received the benefits in which I did and that after a period of time my family would receive the same benefits all free at zero cost to me. I found this to be a plus as most employers do not offer this.

It's hard to balance your life in the first year here and unfortunately that just wasn't a good fit for me at the time I was there. I would recommend for anyone that can do this, DO IT.

good,At ups I thought this job could of been a little better because of everything that have been going on. If I had to come back to Ups I would at a different location.
good,I’d recommend UPS if you’re willing to work fast with precision. This job will be challenging and you will want to quit everyday. However if you can make it through the tough times then it will only get better. With yearly raises and positions where you can make 6 figures a year. You need to be motivated. You must be physically and mentally prepared. If reading this doesn’t make you second guess your decision then apply right now.

good,This place is fun to work at. You'll get exercise and a good workout. You'll meet new and exciting people and it's an experience worth having. They feed you a big meal every friday.
good,You have to be ready to work hard.  People quite because they lack the mindset that you have to work hard and not everything in life is easy and fun. It’s a very physical job very fast paced and a great place to retire from if you just suck it up and put in a good days work.  My goal is to retire from here and nowhere else.  If you want an easy job go to McDonald’s or jack in the box (no disrespect to them they work hard too!)

good,Your driver will be your best friend in the long run. I say that because that’s who you’ll be placed with everyday. He’ll teach you how to work the portable kiosk to help you complete your stop as you go. It can be very tricky but your driver will help you no matter what. You’ll notice how fast and independent you’ve got within the first couple of weeks. It can be stressful but that’s only if you let it.

good,I enjoyed working at UPS they allowed me to work my job on my schedule  based on the 24/7 day operation.  I traveled from NY to central NJ to accomplish my job each and everyday.  I enjoyed working with the employees and assisting in the safety process that is a number one to UPS.  I was also a designated responder which I loved.  I would be called to spills within the Parsippany building.  I then would clean up and dispose of the products according to state and local laws.  I assisted in audits with outside contractors to evaluate the safety process and help correct any short comings to make UPS a safe place to work.
good,If your looking to get involved and move up quick then this is the place to be. Starting out it may not seem like much but the more work and hours you put in the more you get noticed.

The best part was meeting a few cute puppies every day."

good,"This is a real simple job. You need to me a special kinda dense in order to muck it up."
good,Hiring process was quick and painless. It was a seasonal part time position but if performance was excellent possibilities for full time job offer. You work when you could and wanted or if help was needed they'd contact you to see if  you could come in. It's an awesome job with ample oppertunites and a great career choice in my opinion. Would definitely go back and stay. Only reason I left was due to relocating cities . But will definitely try for a seasonal position again in order to get a full time job offer

good,"Productive work place, load up to 4 or 5 trucks every morning. The work was tough, but once your learn your strategy then you should be use to it. You would have to grab your packages out of cages, that actually rotate in circular motion at a speedy pace. I enjoyed working for ups the truck drivers were great and they always loved how neat and organized their trucks were. Its a certain way to load trucks and if you do not get the right formula to it; it could be a rough job for you. Most importantly you should ask your drivers where is there first stop so you could make sure that those packages are closer to the rear of the truck, if there isn't anything going in the RDR or the RDL area so you could pack those packages in that area so it could be easier to get to."
good,UPS is a job that requires a focused mindset and communication with other co workers. It's for people that takes things serious for other people who have brought things and can be trusted to be delivered in a safely manner

good,They were the best. The workers were great the management listened. They were helpful and just all around amazing. If you needed help they would do anything they had to
good,"Ups was a great place to work. I worked there for exactly 1 year as a part time package handler in the evenings. I didn't expect to be paid much for a part time job, it was just a job to pay some bills. My typical shift lasted from 6-10 in the evening and started out loading 2 trailers with outgoing packages. In the summer, the trailers were hot, and in the winter, they were cold. The first hour of the evening was very very fast paced and I got a good workout in. After the two trailers were loaded we got to take a 20 minute break and then had to wash 2 trucks a night. (Super easy) wash windows, organize any packages that weren't delivered that day so they could be delivered the next day, and clean up the building. The management was awesome, they truly cared about their employees. It proves that yes, even a multi-billion dollar corporation can have that tight knit family vibe. I was offered a job as a driver and turned it down because I just didn't care for that line of work. The hours picked up at my day job (welder) and I left soon after."

good,"normally when you work at a warehouse, its pretty hot conditions. Although it was intended to be hot, it wasn't hot. They were also flexible with scheduling."
good,"What can I say , its UPS.  United Parcel Service is a great company and it always has been one.  I look back with regret when I think about leaving that company."

good,"I would definitely work as a delivery driver helper again I worked seasonal at Fort Myers office located on cargo street twice, rode with truck driver one season, and second time drove golf cart which I liked much better."
good,Great place to work.Have much time off. Supervisors treat you with respect and try to make sure you have all the tools to complete your daily job in a safe manner.
good,"good  ******* excellence, ******** advance to go to school, learn different job, careers good, reliable hours, excellence excellence excellence, flexible."
good,I'm not sure if I've had a typical day at work. I learned that this job can make changes in my life. The management was well put together. As far a workplace culture everyone becomes family. the hardest part about this job is loading. The most enjoyable part of the job was losing weight.

good,I was a driver helper for the Christmas and New Years season. I was a seasonal hire. They allow u to work close to home and the driver picked me up. He was a great guy and nice to be around. We had good conversation on our way to deliver packages. Ultimately it’s a tedious job just driving around all day and walking door to door but hours were good and pay was good.

good,"I really did not deal with management, as I only went out twice. It was hard work. My driver was great to work with.  The enjoyable part was learning something new."
good,"Fast paced work environment. Drivers are great to work with on a daily basis, and you learn your routes and routine really quickly. As long as you know how to work hard, fast, and do what your driver asks from you, you will have a job through the season. It may never turn into a full or part time job, but it’s a foot in the door"
good,I personally enjoyed working at ups it showed me that you cant always do things alone you need a team to get some stuff done I honestly dont think that there was ever a time where I thought the job was hard.

good,When I started with the company it was Motor Cargo. It was a tiny company that was like a family and was bought by 2 other companies before it became what it is today. I had the pleasure of working with some great managers and drivers. It's neat to see something so small turn into something so big.
good,I Never worked for UPS. I worked for the ups store which is a completely different organization. the ups store is a franchise as oppose to ups which is a corporation. I worked for a franchisee who paid me for hours worked.

good,I really have enjoyed working for UPS on the last several years. They took very good care of me during the introduction. And throughout my career with them.
good,"My daily job consists of planning and dispatching jobs to engineering mechanics, keeping track of all inventory of the department and providing safety guidance for a safe working environment. Really relaxing job. The hardest part of the job is we need to find out the causes of equipment breakdown"
good,"It’s a wonderful job other than working nights unless you’re that kind of person. The pay is low, but it’s weekly. The job itself was very fun and not stressful. 50% of the time you sit and relax in the van. Working with planes was my favorite part."
good,Great benefits and my supervisor is awesome. Its part time the most you'll work is four hours a day. Whatever the weather is outside that's whats its like inside the warehouse.
good,I Really Liked It My First Time Working There I Did It 3 Times So I Enjoy It Every time. My Supervisor Was Great And The Drivers I Had Were Cool. Best Was Delivering Packages You Get To See So Much Everyday.
good,Has great benefits fast working speed and great hours highly recommend to others job goes by fast aslong as your working at faat paste often hot and cold
good,I really did like Ups I am currently trying to apply again it was a great work place and it was a challenge I would truly recommend it to a friend or a family member.

good,Good people to be around a lot of hard workers and people ready to help you learn about the job and your position  and very flexible with hours and plenty of over time
good,It has a good environment. The people are terrible to work for. The only thing they care about and are there for is the pay check at the end of the week.
good,Taking calls nonstop all day for technical issues with either the platform software or the website software.  Walking customers through using both the computer and website to process labels.
good,"This is a fast paced warehouse job, that will test your willingness to work. If you can make it here any other warehouse job. Will keep you physically fit all year around"
good,The most enjoyable part was every issue was different and new. So it kept my job entertaining. The people were great to work with and it was a fun environment.
good,"Great place to work at, great bonds can be made with your coworkers, and work is always active and always have things to do. They are happy to help teach you things such as forklifts and other machinery."
good,"I love working for UPS, it’s a great place to work. When you leave on Friday you have your schedule for the following week and the hours remain the same. Great management and co workers"
good,Bon travail bonne ambiance bel esprit d'équipe . Tris de colis.
good,"This company is a good company to work for, the environment was fast paced and competitive, the hours I worked was perfect for me being that I was in school at the time, the only reason I left was because I needed a full-time job after school."
good,I worked there for 35 years and had excellent benefits and worked with great people. If you are looking for a career opportunity this is a great place t work. Very stable.
good,"UPS provided me a great opportunity, great salary and was a great place to work"
good,"Spoke to veteran employees and heard good things.  If you're out of shape it's not for you.  It's very fast paced long hours.  Weekends off, good pay and good vacation."
good,"I love working for UPS. They train very well, lots of opportunity for OT, coworkers and supervisors are awesome. Culture is on point, a typical work day is coming and getting right to work."
good,During my time working as an employee at UPS they provide you with work to do your entire shift. Ups is a quick paced job that is a great workout for the day.
good,Working at UPS is a great place to grow and fast pace. There I learned how to lift packages in a proper way and how to be safe in that envuronment. I really enjoyed working there and recommend anyone to work there.
good,It was a good experience overall. A typical day at work starts at 8 am and finishes near or around 9 pm. I learned to manage myself with little help from my superiors. Management could use work on how they operate and expanding the load among all workers. The workplace culture is that of any job. The hardest part of the job are the hours especially when you have family. The most enjoyable part of the job would be waking up to no financial burdens.
good,A hardworking and fast-paced work environment. Stacking and scanning boxes and packages was my only tasks. It doesn’t get any simpler or more basic than that.
good,A fair company that allows a person to grow from within the company. A place where you can advance your skills and learn something new everyday. Also a job that you can travel at times if you wish to do so.
good,"I worked as a driver helper for two holiday seasons with UPS. The drivers were friendly and professional, which provided a great working environment. The job was very physically involved and, therefore, was a great workout!"
good,It was all about safety 3 points of contact on and off the truck. No running in poor weather conditions. Walk fast but not to the point where you can hurt yourself. Stay off people's lawn and walk on the paths. Pretty easy but tough work
good,"Fun and wonderful atmosphere , the staff is top ....I'll never leave . Everyone pulls together together to get all of the projects done , it's just great"
good,"Working at UPS you start from the bottom. If you're not a hardworking person you may have problems. If you are a hard-working person you will naturally do your job day in and day out without issues. I'd admit things were tough my first year which included extra volume peak season. Once I started receiving benefits for me and my family the appreciation for the opportunity took over. People who are not physically fit and do not have either another part-time or full-time job may have problems at UPS. From a personal perspective I work at UPS part time and had a full-time job with wife and kids. I was able to add the income and enjoy the benefits only from UPS for the whole family just for 4 hours of exercise(not even extreme). Driver pay starts at $25 an hour and goes up to 40 after time. Think about it, you come off the street to work a job moving boxes around and after some time you become able to make $40 an hour driving around and delivering packages. Don't get me wrong it's not for everyone but then again it is."
good,"Love being in management, keeps me busy. Good work environment and benefits. Learned a lot in the year I've been here, moved up to part time supervisor in 6 months."
good,I think ups is great for people who want to start their college career and don't know what they want to do yet since it pays really good and doesn't stress you
good,"Highly fast paced, very hard work, demanding, but very enjoyable after working there for a while. Must be able to lift heavy packages, and be able to go back and forth many times to carry packages back and forth."
good,"UPS is a great place to work. If they aren’t on Forbes yet they should be."
good,I would have loved to have been hired permanently.  I enjoyed the fast paced work.  The co-workers were very helpful and supportive of me even though I was one of the few women working there.
good,"ups is a strong company that listens to its employees, and makes you feel like you have a voice in the company. All ideas are welcome. Weekly meetings on safety, and areas they can make better."
good,A very hard working job its relaxed at some times and good people.. Very clean and nice security .. Very serious on hard work labor but mostly easy job
good,this job is very ok it would have been better if I wasn't working with people my own age all they cared about is where they was going for spring break and when all was going
good,"Enjoy the workers as well as the people in charge, offers good benefits as well as many chances to improve oneself in business and management fields.."
good,"a typical day with UPS is very active, and I liked it. i`d ride around town with a guy that was taller than me, and his only job was to drive the UPS truck from house too house. 6:30 was when i`d get off, so when the sun was going down."
good,"Short term, pays good, easy work.  I received a bonus every week . for being available all week long.  The driver even bought me lunch for most of the job."
good,"Package Handlers are responsible for the unloading, sorting, scanning, and loading of packages in the hub. They move a variety of packages and they process these efficiently for the warehouse operations. Package Handlers work in a physically-demanding and fast-paced warehouse environment, and they continually lift, lower and slide packages for the duration of their shifts. They work with conveyor and roller belts, inside the trailers, cargo containers and package cars. Shift hours can vary because of changes in package volume.

good,"It was a fast-paced environment, I enjoyed it. The time I work at UPS was during the holiday season. You must be very dependable. I was felt worthy after each work day."
good,it was UPS Stores big difference than UPS but i really enjoyed learning the process of dealing with the public and giving customer service as i did for fellow coworkers at previous jobs.
good,"The management staff is wonderful and always willing to coach you and train you for new possibilities."
good,If you love to work out it’s a good job ...you gotta load n unload the truck n then move on to the next ..it’s a fast pace job u gotta stay moving ..you get a 15 min break
good,"I like hard work they treated me well ,it was a easy and smooth experience I will like to work again for them.im thankful for what they taught me  ,th"

good,Ups provides a safe work environment and proper training  procedures so all employees can’t maintain safety awareness and also a good company to work for
good,at ups i was in charge of loading the trucks. i also was in charge of scanning the packages and placing them on the right belt. i then moved on to splitting the belts where i placed the boxes in the black red or white belt.
good,Have integrity be able to make quick and safe decision on loading and unloading and with your coworker.and prepare for longer shift and better pay at times good place to work.
good,"I would still be in this position but they were unable to give me hours due to low volume.  If you have the opportunity to get in there are a variety of great opportunities.  They offer excellent benefits, help with undergraduate degrees, and room to move up (plus you get a ton of exercise).  I’m looking to rejoin the company in a sales role and hope to get back in.  Easily the best company I’ve ever worked for.  They really take care of their employees."
good,Its a four and half part time job of loading boxes or stacking them you have a too move quick in  fast be safe look before stepping Drink 8 cups of water
good,Overall I have enjoyed the company and have learned a lot about management. I want to become full time and take on more tasks. My goal is to gain better service production for the company and take on new obstacles
good,"I was only in a temporary position, i don't have a lot to say about it, but I know that it's a great place to work if you are looking for a permanent position."
good,"Ups was an great job. It was great pay,and was an great daily excersise. I had to quit due to the fact it didn’t not work with my school schedule. This was one of my favorite jobs."

good,"Seasonal Driver-Long process to get back on, or at least in my case.Stayed busy all day, but the pay was worth it. Different on road sups made some days hectic due to planning issues or misunderstanding within."
good,"It is an awsome company to work for and would love the opportunity to do it agian. Great people, high energy job. Keeps you on got your toes. The holidays seemed to be the busiest.  The people are nice, the hours werent  too bad and the drivers were cool.  I got hired immediately and the training wasn't too hard or long.  I was on the truck within a week i believe.  I wish i could have stayed on but the job was seasonal.  I would really love the opportunity to be a permanent party of the team.  I loved being on the truck."
good,I like how it was a fast paced job. The breaks where long enough and the co-workers so easy to get along with. If you have a problem you could ask for help.

good,"This job offered me a lot of benefits, but the downside was that you had to work there for about a year to start receiving any of it. They offered me a supervisor postion, but I found out after that they get no benefits what so ever."
good,I unloaded semi trucks in the warehouse. it was a night time job and they didn't offer many hours. management was very friendly and willing to help. the hardest part of the job is working in the hot truck in the middle of summer.
good,This job is very fast paced. You got to have a lot of energy working here because the boxes that come in are very heavy and you have to be able to lift them.

Definitely job security is #1 because they aren’t going anywhere. Drone delivery? What!?"
good,"start time was depending on if their was a holiday or not, most of the time we started about 230am. I learned really fast and they moved me from working up on the slower paced area, down to the front line as a scanner. I was able to make it fun, and do my work at the same time. My management was very easy to talk to if I had a problem with anything.  The hardest part of my job was moving packages so quickly, but it was just part of the job.  The most enjoyable part was being asked to stay for the air truck."
good,Everyday I got there and we stretched did our safety talks and got to work. I walked into my trailers and scanned the packages and loaded them neatly in the truck.

It seemed like everyone working there was pretty happy. They pay very good but expect you to work your butt off. I think it was a perfect fit for me.

good,"Forget the gym! Work at UPS and get paid to do exercise. "
good,Ups is a place to make friends. It does take a toll on you if you are loader or unloader. Some days are bad some days are good. I wouldn’t typically call this a job that you would have your whole life unless you turn to full time. This place is exhausting but it is a job until you find another one.

The management was very easy to get along with and worked with you. The workplace culture was inviting and rather friendly. We all got along on my side of the building really well and talked nearly the entire time while being able to keep up with our packages. The hardest part of the job was only being able to keep up with the packages when they came down the belt heavily. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was easy to get along with my coworkers and it was early enough to keep my other job.
good,There was a a weird battle between two aspects of the company that ran the warehouse. The Union and the actual UPS. Although it was a hassle there is way way to fit in you can stomach it.

Everyone works on their own trucks and it can be  stressful and fast paced, it feels very good leaving out of the job site sweating. It's a bit of a personal race to get boxes into the truck by 8 am, but help is always provided. Sometimes you may get hit with heavy loads or more packages than expected but they definitely work you up until what you are capable of doing and don't overwork you. Overall they are a great job to work for, very nice managers, and you can move easily to different departments."

good,This is a very fast moving and physically demanding job. The benefits make it all worth while. Management expects much out of each employee. You are expected to push hard daily.
good,"I was able to add this job to one I already had because of the shift I worked.  Being seasonal, it was a time when more parcels than usual were in need of getting to the correct destination. This was before computerized sorting so I manually sorted and preloaded packages for vehicles.  I also assisted drivers with deliveries and managed electronic records."

good,My typical work day includes cleaning out trailers and keeping the yard clean as well.  I'm earning a lot of about time management and safety rules.  The management has always been very nice to me and they always have an open door policy. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the elements outside.  The most enjoyable part of the job not sitting at a desk and the people.
good,Have to be very motivated and fit. Also have to be following strict safety rules. It's very fast paced sometimes over 13 hours non-stop. Some holidays you will be required to work.
good,The computer application is too limited.   I owned the UPS store.  I did not work for UPS.   Customer Service was critical for sales.   The days were past paced.   Had a great deal of fun running my own business.

good,I loved this job it was not an easy going job it kept me busy it kept my focused. This job was great with management the place was very quiet for the most part. the hardest part of this job was coming into work with a truck that has stuff just thrown all over the place and having to pick it all up and get my job started all at the same time.

good,"UPS is strick on their uniforms. Safety is their most important thing. I was on call for my first season with the company. I got to experience pulling two trailers. I enjoyed working there very much. I was a seasonal driver, but I would like to be a perminant driver. I am hoping by next season they will make me a perminant driver."
good,the environment was so positive. i enjoyed working with the fellow coworkers. the supervisor came up to me and asked if i needed assistance on sorting thru the mail.
good,Great company. Great benefits. Union is great. Transfer process is a pain because of the Union. Over all I would recommend this company to anyone. Start young tho. It’s a young mans game.
good,Opportunities to grow the business Focused on sales and company growth- Offers job security- Enjoy customer interactions and opportunity to offer first class service
good,I have been with UPS for almost 2 years and although it is just part time you are able to grow with the company. You work in 4-5 hours but it is all hard work. Monday through Friday. No weekends

good,While working at UPS as a package handler you going to gain muscle and your going to lose weight. Additionally the personalities of your co-workers help keep the job fun and stress free.
good,Very physically demanding work. I lost 25 lbs in one month. You carry heavy packages and sometimes a few flights of stairs. The pay and hours were not enough for the demand that this job has. I liked the work and drivers I worked with. It was challenging. UPS pays part time employees around $2 more per hour. And seasonal employees 10.35 per hour. I think if they would pay more they can look forward for seasonal helpers to come back when needed for the peak season. Besides they  pay the divers I worked for were awesome.
good,"I enjoy working for UPS, just not enough hours.  I currently work part-time hors and I am looking for a full-time position.  The work responsibilities are not overwhelming,"
good,"At UPS, one is rewarded for his or her hard work and effort. The job entailed heavy lifting and fast paced work. The amount of work was typically overwhelming but manageable. One was paid very well especially during the holiday season. I do not have any negative complaints about the company or about the way it is run."
good,"The pay is really good.  You get paid every week"
good,The job is fast-pace and youre on your feet a lot.  The managment doesnt really know whats going on until the last minute.  they are also bad at relaying information to the employees in a timely manner.  the only good thing about the job is the pay and benifits.
good,"Quick paced work place. Very physical job involving picking up, moving and relocating packages. If you’re like me and like a more hands on type of job it’s a good place to work."
good,The work was consistent and laid back most of the other employees were very friendly including supervisors I would definitely  go back to work there if they needed.
good,"Reliable transportation is key as you may have to meet with a driver or travel to tge wherehouse in inadequate weather, also comfortable shoes are a must, stretch drink plenty of water and to maintain that energy monitor what you eat off and on duty, avoid energy drinks! But bring snacks, healthy food is key to bringing it to the table at this job"

I was sad that it was seasonal, but I highly recommend it. The company, and their employees are intelligent, friendly, and helpful."

I was polite and courteous to each and every customer, despite our busy location and went above and beyond with every request."
good,"Really enjoyed my time as a Seasonal Driver Helper. Would have liked more of a chance to move into the warehouse."
good,I Really liked the job and the fast work pace. Company attitude was very professional and quick paced. Always busy and appreciated by all customers. Hard work does not go unnoticed

good,I applied seasonal driver helper during holiday.  I rode with the driver and help him to deliver packages to houses and businesses.  Loved the job! Its fun!
good,My tenor at UPS was great.  I learned allot from fellow employees and managers.  I was able to excel in my positions with UPS Ground.  My only unsatisfying experience within UPS was UPS freight management in San Antonio Texas.  He was not very understanding when it came to family emergencies and was quick to make an employee ineligible for rehire. Even though the employee had shown that their previous employment with the company on the side of UPS Ground showed advancement within that department.
good,"come in to the office log in the computer star my day by checking emails and answering them, answering phone calls fixing paper work for driver dispatching"

good,"• Loading and unloading aircraft"
good,The days are long and rough but good. UPS is a very physical job that aquires you to be on your feet and ready work. I am surrounded by helpful and friendly people.
good,I think it's a good place to work just not enuf hours. You have to learn to stack boxes and move quickly and have trucks done on time. You have to have a routine.
good,"The seasonal position consisted of the volume increase during the holidays. We would start our shift different times depending on the amount of volume we had that day. Unloading trucks and sorting the packages so that they may be scanned into the system, and loading the delivery trucks in a timely manner so that the packages could be delivered to the customer."
good,I work at UPS as a seasonal job during the holidays helping my dad. When you are a seasonal helper you do a lot of running to get the merchandise that the customers order to there door without being damaged. If you enjoy a good workout this job is the one for you.
good,"Sorting packages to the right places they needed to be put in, finishing boxes quickly so that other boxes can get done as well then I had separate work where I sorted mail in bags and then put them in there correct spot."
good,"Helped customers, packed and shipped items. Typical day at UPS Store. Working in customer service is always difficult but the training was what made it easier."

good,"The work is easy and the pay is great, Normally its really busy during the peak season You have to be ready to work especailly if your helping the drivers"
good,Good place to work I love it there. Will be there for life highly recommend it. Vacations raises every year. Insurance people are great to work with just gotta work hard.

good,On a regular day we load up the UPS trucks and head on our route. We have to deliver every package to its direct address and make sure the package is delivered to owner. Once all packages are delivered you head back to UPS building and sign out for the day. You usually work 5-8 hours a day depending on how fast you can deliver your packages.
good,"Worked in the feeder dept. assisting subcontractors with their loads. verifying Information."
good,Every day was super busy and full of different challenges all the time. I learned that you can never expect to not have work or sit around and not do anything. I also learned how to become an office manager and organize my work better to be successful.

good,I would deliver packages during the very busy winter months and the satisfaction the customer would  give when the package were delivered was gratifying.
good,I loved working for UPS. Unfortunately my work schedule conflicted with my school schedule so I had to resign. Everything offered at UPS is hard to find anywhere else.
good,No day is typical. You have to come in mentally and physically prepared for any and everything. Very collaborative quick paced atmosphere. I work along with the management and hourly staff to ensure compliance with all state and safety regulations.
good,One must enjoy sweating and working hard. Long non stop days jumping in and out of truck lifting packages and running in and out of buildings and up and down stairs.
good,I find working at ups was a good job and had some good hours yes we got thirty minute lunches the only thing they need to do is tell the new hires what time they will get off.
good,my review is quite simple. UPS is a joyful place to work at. But to tell you the truth I have never worked here before I don't know why the computer is asking me these questions? Based on what facts did they come up with this.

good,Being a seasonal driver helper for UPS is not bad in my opinion. The task is very simple and the drivers are usually cooperative and friendly. I'll recommend this position.
good,"It's unfortunate that UPS has a high turn over rate for employment.  I offer a totally different perspective of UPS as a fortune 500 and International Company that I worked for almost five years and have just been accepted back after a family leave.  I'll start by being honest it's extremely fast paced and very physically demanding and often could be a very volatile environment with brutal conditions based on weather conditions.  However, UPS and their full time lead management team and union policies help to compensate for all those working conditions and factors.  First they offer four part time shifts which are approximately 3 and 1/2 to 5 hour shifts other than during peak season, which endured from the week of Thanksgiving to the first week of January.   However, anything worked over that base 5 hours and one automatically made time and half and on each shift there would be an allotted paid 10 minute break.  Also after one year of employment there would be the allotment of a benefit package and yearly raise based on the individuals contract.   The benefits package after one year includes free health insurance covering vision and dental  for the individual and that of their family members and two weeks of paid vacation.  They also offer tuition assistance and honor almost every situation that life affords and work generously with those employees to accommodate.  Also over time there is a plethora of opportunities to grow and excel within the company.  So if one doesn't mind working hard it is a great opportunity for anyone and in any situation in life!"
good,"Great place to work,fast paced and you need to get the job done, feels good delivering nice parcels to people and most of the time that makes the happy"
good,"It was my first job and I was a bit overwhelmed at first. However, as time passed I learned invaluable skills and developed a good understanding of the industry and the business"

good,I was the assistant to the ups driver during the holiday season. Learned how to use the ups tracking system. Carried plenty of heavy loads to peoples houses. Great workplace and a place where you can advance thru hard work.
good,UPS is a company filled with opportunity and advancement. Starting at the lowest level I quickly worked my way up to supervising and love it. My job is to coach and motivate employees to perform at the highest level they possibly can while also focusing on safety and the production of the company. This way not only does it weed out individuals that don’t have what it takes to work at UPS but it helps change the lives for those who put in the hard work and commitment at UPS.
good,"Shipping and receiving was apart of  the everyday life at the UPS store.  There were also other aspects of the job like remembering special codes, long time and short time customers, as well as the different mailboxes that belonged to certain customers."

good,I loved the productivity of the workplace and the coworkers. It's a good place to stay in shape and get yourself into a routine. The trainers and supervisors are usually very helpful and amazing.
good,"This was probably one of my favorite jobs. The managers were super nice, the coworkers were great, everyone worked together, and you were always checked on to assure you stayed hydrated. A 10-15 minute break was provided in a break room that contained drink/snack machines, a microwave, a tv, and food utensils. The company itself offers so many benefits and cares about their workers safety. I had to leave my job due to medical issues that kept me from working.

good,"I started at UPS when I was 19. It is hard to actually get hired in my area, there are a lot of applicants that come in everyday looking for a job and only so many positions to be filled. I started off managing our counter, we ship packages, fix addresses and take phone calls from drivers and customers. Within 6 months, I was moved up to PM Dispatcher, which I had been training for since I started working there. It is a pretty simple job, it really just depends on the day, it could be very slow and you can find time to organize the office or warehouse or it could be so busy you can't take a breath between phone calls. There are difficult days, but overall this is a wonderful place to work. This is a job where you do have to be constantly motivated, nobody will hold your hand and tell you what needs to be done, but if you don't know how to do something, help is available."
good,Work hard and they'll work you hard!  You'll definitely work up a sweat lifting g those packages up and down all day long. So don't be afraid to get a little dirty!

good,"Good work environment good people hard work steady pay. Allot to learn,can take the experience anywhere.Make just enough to get situated.Fast pace stayed busy."
good,I never worked in a warehouse before. Being a pre loader wasn’t easy because of my build. I’m short and very small so lifting 70 pounds wasn’t hard but jumping in and out of those trucks became a work out. by far the best experience even if it feels closed in at times.
good,UPS is a career not a job. They care about their employees and advancement is unlimited. Great place to work would highly recommend. They have great benefits and retirement.

Things that you can learn while working there include: how to properly pack an item, working well with a team to reach a common goal, and how to correctly close a store and balance the tills. Management is very polite and always willing to work with you and your schedule. The hardest part of the job would be the fact that you're on your feet most of the day lifting heavy boxes at times. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you build with mailbox holders, and the people you work with."
good,My first day of work was challenging but only because I was hired during the holidays so it was millions of packages and I wasn't dressed for the weather.

good,I would get my scanner and wrap my belt around my waist. Get in my trailer and start to load as fast as I could to make sure that the flow was constantly moving. Making sure that the walls of my boxes are tight and so their when the truck docked at another location nothing shifted out of place. When i was done they would bring  me another truck and the i would do it all over again.

good,Everyday is a new day. Very fast paced and hard work. I learned to become faster at what I did. Management was always doing there job. Everyone I worked with was super nice.

They will teach you how to be an expert in supervising and safety. If you stay after the first year, you will get one of the best benefit packages in The United States"

I like the fact I just focus on my task at hand, I knew what I was doing the moment I walk in love that"
good,Ups is a busy place. I’m used to moving around frequently. I’m used to lifting heavy packages. Everyone there is cool it’s just that they don’t pay enough for the work you do.
good,"My typical day at work involved checking out customers, making sure all of the other workers knew what they were doing and if they needed any help then I had to assist them.

good,I loved UPS I would go back if I could Just needed for hours for more pay to be able to be financial stable but love the management and employees by the company having a union the employees comes first
good,I think the management and loaders could work together more. It is not a very pleasant day when people are at each others throat about.Dispatchers do try and make it as easy as possible but that does not always end up working out that way.
good,Working at ups is exactly what you would expect. you either stack boxes into trucks or you pull them out on to conveyors to be processed for someone else to stack.
good,"Fast paced, must pay attention to detail, must be able to lift 70lbs or more, consistent bending, twisting, lifting, good management, can listen to music"

good,"it was a relaxed workplace all i did was unload and load items being sent out and brought in. it was an easy job so nothing really to learn, management was great, the hardest part was starting the shift because it was really cold but once you got your body moving you warmed up to it."
good,If you are looking for a fast-paced job and get some exercise in this the job for you. You are continuously working at a high pace and you have to be able to endure.

good,I worked the early morning/ overnight shift. It was pretty intense and was very physical but I enjoyed it. They were offering us to stay for more hours or ride with a driver to get more hours and experience. It was a great experience working there during their busy season.
good,"UPS was a really great job and I enjoyed working for them, GO UPS! :)"
good,I was a seasonal worker when I work for UPS so I drove truck with another person to help deliver packages during the busy times of the year and they would only call us when they needed us so it was not an everyday thing it was an on-call thing
good,It's not a job that pays a lot of money but it does have many ways to advance. They have great benefits once you reach the time that you need to hit in order to get them
good,"It's all about accountability, seniority always gets first choices, we all worked together to get the job done as a whole. For example, my driver and I were pretty efficient, and we would usually finish and then go meet other drivers that had alot of packages still to go. Teamwork."
good,"I loved working at ups . Every year I would reapply because the experience is great , they pay is good and the techniques you learn can be applied in real life"

The management is great and so very friendly, and helpful. The culture in the workplace is well and it's a very easy going, well taken care of store. I greatly enjoy it. The hardest part of the job is not knowing how to do certain things because I still am new. The most enjoyable part is seeing the customers happy.

good,"A typical day at UPS consisted of: unloading packages from trailer trucks, placing them on the conveyor belt which eventually sorted packages to their designated area by location. Once that was completed, I was to assist with delivery. While here, I learned about the operations of UPS. This job also taught me time management and patience. The workplace was diverse and my coworkers were friendly. In my opinion, the hardest part of the job was the scheduling, however, the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people each day."

good,When left i was saddened i had been there for so long i thought i was going to retire there but my  family comes first i got happily i moved and here i am in Douglasville Georgia ready to work.
good,"In my small amount of time working for UPS I definitely had to build a lot of tolerance for rude customers if we got any, speed to keep up with the daily tasks, and muscles to lift up to 75 pounds with the help of another UPS guy. It was definitely not an easy pay off. If you can not make certain days and don't call ahead of time they will replace you. There is no slack in this work field. You must be willing to do what must be done and on a time schedule. Packages can not be late not even by 5 minutes. I feel the most difficult part about working season there was going up 3 - 5 flights of stairs within different apartments. But the rush, the cool weather, and making friends with customers was well worth it all. Especially making the customers happy."
good,At UPS you would love working their no questions asked about it good work environment and great insurance and 401k benefits its a great opportunity wish I was still working their.

good,Great place to work fast paced friendly people great benefits and lots of opportunities to grow further pay is very competitive flexible schedules love ups
good,At UPS i loved working there it was so fun to be there. i was a loader i had to put any size object or box into my aircraft container.

If I didn't have issues with a injury from another company and could move fast I'd come back to this possibly."
good,The work was physically demanding but it was like going to the gym for free.  The pay was very good and overtime was a plus during peak season.  Exhausting but great.
good,It is factory work. Demanding labor. Very cool employees. Always busy. No free time. Advancement in the company just takes way too long. It was a very repetitive career
good,Easy place to work and get personal time. Always happy no compaints and customers were great to work with. I enjoyed my time at The UPS Store and would highly recommend it
good,"Depending on your position, starting off is usually package handling (unloading or loading.) Loading is usually compared to Tetris, while unloading is similar to Jenga. There is more thought into loading than there would be for unloading. It is a fun and fast paced environment. If you are not used to manual labor or constantly lifting packages that range from 2-150 pounds (surprisingly can be even more), for 4 hours straight, with a break between, this job is not for you."

good,UPS has been a great service provider for delivering important packages to its customers. If you want to be a part of a working team setting UPS is the place to be.
good,"Overall my favorite place to work so far, even having a seasonal position it was great. Management worms with you gets to know you, provided uniforms are good, fast paced chill-to-the- bone work out the door of a UPS truck was exciting and very fun."
good,Was an awesome experience being able to drive around my town meeting and seeing something new everyday. Was always on the move so it was a good way to also get exercise.

I worked during the winter but never seemed to be cold. I was taken care of by my driver. He always asked if I needed to take a break or if I needed to stop for food. The coordinator for the Driver Helpers also would check in with me to make sure things were going well. I loved every day of work and actually cried on my last day.

good,A description for the typical day at UPS would be riding in the truck delivering packages to expecting customers. I learned to adapt to a strict time schedule to achieving set goals. I really enjoyed my coworkers and their company while on the clock. This job is very physically demanding which I really enjoyed.
good,"A typical day at UPS was scanning packages and data entry. I learned truck routes, data entry and teamwork. The management was only needed in machinery malfunctions or miscommunication. The workplace culture was awesome among employees. The hardest part of the job was lack of hours. The most enjoyable to completing the job before the shift was over. Teamwork."

good,Its a very fun job to do. You get to meet nice people when your out delivery packages whether its to houses or businesses. The employees are very helpful.
good,"A typical day at work would involve loading packages onto package trucks. It is laid back at my hub but you are kind of your own boss in the sense that you manage yourself. Everyone is a team so if you are not finished loading your packages  onto your package trucks, which you get at max of 4 trucks a day, your team would help out at the end. But it is cutthroat because if you don't load a certain amount of packages they will fire you."

Everyone who I've worked with were super friendly, professional and admirable. There wasn't anything I couldn't do in this job nor had any issues with in any aspect. I loved coming to work, it really felt like a second home. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting and working alongside the drivers. We enjoyed challenging each other and making ends meet. They were funny and easy to strike a task and have a conversation with."
good,"Excellent environment to work, interesting people and very fun job to do, the pay isn't all that great but not bad also ($10:75) this is also a part time job. Depending on the driver you have, some are nice and some are just plain wicked, they will make you do all the work. I asked if my driver could have my for my whole period there, he was too nice."

good,"This is fun job to exercise (essentially) and get paid for doing it.  The job is challenging at first, but over time will get better.  Best for students!"
good,In the beginning of the shift requires set up and making sure everything is in place and on hand for all purpose. I've learned to communicate and build relationships to get the job done and meet my staff needs. Management does a great job with setting everything we to meet our goal for the day. The workplace culture is very diverse which is my one my favorite things about UPS. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people with different goals and personalities. The hardest part of this job is getting employees to come on time.

good,Working for ups as a driver helper was very difficult by liffting so many packages to the doors of houses for people who never said thank you. for the ones that were home at least.
good,Very good wage for this company.  I started in a temporary driver but was too long of a wait to be hired on as full time driver. Work is difficult but the pay is excellent.  Union company so management is like a competitor than co-worker.  Overall would not pass on the chance of being full time with this company.
good,Fun and productive place to work. learned a lot about how business like amazon run.  Met a lot of good characters and friends. would definitely suggest it to anyone.
good,"WORK EXPERIENCE"
good,i enjoyed my job at ups but wasn't able to pay bills so now im looking for something better. but i would recommend this job for anyone very enjoyable and fun to work there.
good,Working nights allowed me to be with my kids after school. Great benefits and discounts. I almost took them up on their education assistance. I made good friends working at UPS. We were very busy around the holidays and we almost received full-time hours.
good,My experience has been really wonderful.  My co-workers and supervisor have gone a long way to make me feel welcome and valued.  I feel like I am part of the team even though I am a temporary intern.

good,Everyday I met with my driver to help him deliver packages and it was a blast. I met tons of new people who seemed to love the delivery guy. I learned that a smile goes a long way.

good,"UPS was by far one of my favorite jobs. the only problem i was having from them were the amount of hours per week. it wasnt enough to maintain a lifestyle. but the associates were amazing, management was as well really enjoyed the experience."
good,"Good place to work. A typical day for me consisted of an average stop count of 210. My truck was typically loaded with 350-450 packages. My day ended when I delivered the last package in my truck and returned to the hub to unload the pickups I gathered throughout the day. My management team was very helpful and understanding when I first started. As I gained experience I noticed there was a culture of ""just get the job done"" at my facility. That worked for me most times. The thing that I disliked the most about the job, was the work/life balance. There was no balance. I would leave the house at 7:30am and not get home until 9:00pm. There were even nights that I got home at 11:00pm during ""peak season"". The parts I enjoyed most were being outside, meeting all kinds of people, and finally the health benefits they provided."
good,I loved working at UPS I loved working with the people there they ask alot of questions and it was good experience for me  the supervisors are hands on they make sure you know everything you're suppose to know
good,"the benefits are fantastic. overall a great place to work. the hours are awesome, the people are friendly and overall the job is challenging but rewarding."
good,I was fortunate enough to move up through the ranks and promote fairly quickly. I loved the work and the people I worked with. UPS was flexible with my schedule of attending the academy as well as my home life.
good,i really enjoyed working for UPS. i just did no like the fact that i worked really hard as seasonal worker. and they still would not hire me full time thats why i had to quit and find another job
good,"UPS is a great place to start a career. Almost everyone starts off as a package handler, and promote thereafter. At the start of your career, you begin to learn about package handling, how to load, unload, sort and destinations. From there, you learn the essentials of work safety, government ordinances, and how to effectively communicate with one another."
good,Fast pace environment with a strong emphasis on employee safety. Part-time employees receive healthcare packages. Longer hours required during holiday season. Not a good job for those who don't respond well to a production driven environment.
good,"UPS is a fantastic place to work. They have a very positive work environment, where people are more likr family then co-workers. Upper management takes time to invest themselves in employees they see a possibility of advancement in. They also provided paid short term disability while people are out on maternity leave. And are willing to work with people who may require flex ability when coming back from leave. Over all I fully enjoyed my time working at UPS and wish all my former co-workers the best."
good,Fun learning experience that helped me realized how interesting sorting packages is. Also boost up my physical strength due to picking up packages as heavy as 70lbs.
good,"First week I learned how to packing boxes and shipping, I learned to used computers for shipping, printed, coppies and I learnet to used Fax, I separed emails box, etc."
good,I would go back but the is such a high rate of turnover that even the supervisors wouldn't make it past 1 month and I would have to tell the new supervisor how we do the job since we accually knew what to do unlike the newly hired supervisors.
good,Package handling and unloading of shipping trucks. Provided tuition assistance towards college education. Motivated growth within the company. Prepare you for manufacturing companies
good,"This job was seasonal only , it was fast paced and the schedules were always changed . The management team were helpful. Everything over 5 hours were time and a half."
good,"When the DIAD board storing all the stops and all the package information during the ride of the driver, it was my job to extract all this information and make available on paper for a trail."
good,Yes every job is stressful good benefits get raises enjoy the people that I work with I like the job I work Twilight hours from 1:30 in the morning till 8:30 in the morning sometime from 3 in the morning till 8:30 to 9 in the morning I enjoy the job it's kind of hard to get up through the night but when you enjoy going to a job you don't mind getting up.
good,Didn't work there long but I had a great time and my supervisor was amazing and during that short time I learned a lot and it helped me in my next job.
good,"Hard place to go to work at, hours and pay were pretty rough. The raining you receive there is next to none. They really care that everyone is well informed."
good,"Good place to work at, everybody is there to make a future for them selves or to make some money for them and theur family, a good work vibe, and everyone is just looking out for eachother"

I liked the fact that at UPS we had a variety of people there, which means when we would have potlucks we could taste other cultures food. I also loved the fact that all levels of management had an open door policy from human resources to my immediate supervisor. The company is family oriented and also promoted healthy living, there were incentives like Employee Appreciation events, parking spot for a month, you could win UPS bucks to buy UPS logo items. We celebrated birthdays by decorating desks, we promoted from within, every year each employee would get 80 hours of discretionary to use at your discretion. These are just some of the highlights of working there, I could go on and on. Overall GREAT company."
good,"A typical day working at UPS is all set as soon as we enter the facility. I learned to respect safety policies as an individual in order to lift our awareness. Management has plenty of guides, people who look at the hopeful process in us being successfully involved in the work force, and not paid consequences for the newcomers foul demeanor, which is deemed likely. The workplace culture is outstanding, an open place for observation. The hardest part of the job is finding package numbers, as far as the address goes, and the special number UPS assigns.

good,"A typical day involved clocking in, getting your equipment checked and ready for the day. Meeting with supervisors to get a game plan and preparing for the planes to come in. Once the planes landed everyone got in place and knew what to do. We made sure we had quick turn around and the planes were out in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job was during the hottest and coldest part of the seasons. You had to make sure you drank plenty of fluids to avoid passing out due to physical labor mixed with extreme temperatures. Over all it was a great place to work. I felt challenged and took it upon myself to make sure I was familiar with every piece of equipment so that if they needed anyone to operate them, they could call on me."

A typical work day for me, because the job is part-time, is five hours of non stop motion at an intense pace with a ten minute break randomly in between the five hour work period. The hardest part about the job is definitely the irregs, those are packages that are too big and heavy to be carried down the belt. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the people I work with, it's a all for one and one for all workplace which makes the job much more enduring."

good,Package handlers usually work for courier companies or warehouses where their main duty is to pick packages and make them ready for deliveries or shipments. They assemble cartons according to the items that need to be packed – fragile items will be packed in properly padded cartons – so they need to make sure that they follow the protocols provided to them when handling different types of packages.
good,"working for ups was a friendly environment and fast moving place to work; I worked well with the other employees, only wish i was giving more hours, but it was a part time; they have parking lot for those that drive, the bus stop if you are commuting is down the block, so that was a plus.I would highly recommend working there as it gives young adults the opportunity to also attend school and you get compensated for it; they are a company who look to help employees grow in the company and education."

good,"when in started as a loader it was miserable just becuse i started in the summer. sometimes it brutal but for the most part its worth the free health care and other benefits that come along with working there. when i worked there i began to understand the process of how items that are ordered get around. everyone in ups seemed more like a family then just co workers. the hardest part about the job is summer, working in the 90 degree truck, but it makes for a good work out. the most enjoyable thing about it was the people and sorting. if your good with hands ask for a sorting job"

The hardest part of the job was getting in and out of the truck all day.  The weather also was a pretty hard thing.. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers.

Reviewing the order and researching each one in a very detailed manner to ensure the product was exactly what was stated on each shipping form. Translating different languages with the help of many programs UPS offered to make our job easier. Once everything was clearly and correctly verified a numeric code would be placed on each item listed on the shipping slip and then cleared to be sent to Customs and Homeland Security at the UPS Hub. All of my trainers, team leaders, and supervisors were extremely helpful with any situation or question you had regarding a shipment. They would sit with you for however long it took to reassure you that you were making the correct move or placing the correct numeric code on each and every shipment if you were ever in doubt. They always pushed you to your fullest potential even if you didn't feel like you were there that night at work for whatever reason. The hardest part of the job was making sure you were most definitely translating in the correct language because other people's lives were at stake if you made even the smallest mistake. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ""family atmosphere"" that everyone felt."
good,I had an overall great experience as a seasonal drivers helper. My driver was great at giving me instructions to accommodate him in delivering packages. If I have the opportunity to work again next peak season I definitely will!!

These people were all about getting the job done with an extreme emphasis on Safety. The only thing I didn't like about the job was that my position was temporary. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there and wish I was a full time employee.

I had no problem working overtime or staying longer and coming in earlier. Rush jobs weren't problems."
good,"The fast paced work environment that refuses to let you slack around is great for anyone wanting to lose some pounds and gain some muscle. I loved working here and I would love to go back, the people are hands on loving happy people who take's their job seriously. The hardest part is the lifting and perhaps the workload but you catch on pretty quickly. A typical day is fast and hard but it's worth it in the end when you're walking off the job.

good,It was very difficult to load 18 tracker wheeler but i did it. It's good to help one another at time I did not get help but I did It myself.

Most enjoyable part was the customers and supportive manager."
good,i loved working for ups i did it 4 years seasonal.but they never hit me back up to come back the hardest thing was when they did not call me back because i fell in love with my job. the most enjoyable part of the job was going out and delivery packages and seeing the clients faces when it gets there.

High Value Clerks are put into action to find and retrieve packages that are in the facility. Delegating certain duties such as driver confirmations, auditing package loads, and walking the facility are done on a daily basis. I engage in objectives given by my mangers and partners on the daily goal and what is pressing at the moment.

good,"A typical work day at UPS is physically challenging at first, but after proper training and effectiveness in proper safe work methods, the job becomes easier. I learned a lot about the different paths of life that come into UPS, a lot of employees been there for over ten years and they enjoy what they do and who they work for. The management team works well with their employees and communication is very important to them. They talk with their employees and try to work out ways to benefit both the employee and the company, in that order.The hardest part of the job is getting through the rough patch that usually last about 30 days, because it is a very physical job it can be challenging for some. However, the most enjoyable part of the job is withstanding those 30 days and performing your best to be a contributing factor to your team. There is no greater satisfaction."
good,It was a great place to work. I liked working for them. Nice people decent pay local. Was a good job to have. Just a regular job with good people an good work.

Then I moved to the preload where we loaded the package cars every morning. Eventually I was promoted to part time supervisor of the preload. I supervised a belt of 10-20 employees. I enjoyed my job quite a bit until I left.
good,"It was a great experience for me to be able to work with a team. I learned a lot about team work and the importance of following up on even the simplest of tasks for positive results. The most enjoyable part of work was being able to make repairs on the building,"
good,"Extremely successful company over the past 6 years. As an employee you only work up to 4-5 hours per day, moving up 500-1000 packages per hour. Its very physical, and can be effected by the weather. The hardest part is learning the required information needed, other than that if your use to physical work you should be just fine.

good,"A day at UPS consists anywhere from sorting packages for their trailer location, loading packages onto trailers, and sorting misplaced packages. Within all of these are packages that range anywhere from 0-120 pound packages. The management is split into various work areas where they are in charge of a number of workers. Co-workers are more than cooperative to help anyone with heavy packages. The most enjoyable part is the friendly environment."
good,"Hard Working"
good,I like constantly moving and meeting people and this job gave me the  opportunity to do both and go to school. I learned to communicate with my coworker and function as a unit to get packages to the customers in a timely manner.

good,"Very consistent with the work the store is always clean and the workers are very polite and funny "
good,I have worked third shift at UPS. It is a good job for people who goes to school and worked they're way up to do something more. My intention at that job was for my education. Working there for years kind of burn me out due of lack of focus in school. It is tough for me to work two jobs and being a full time. We all made some changes and experience in our life that we believe we could do things but i tried. I love to work hard and earn for what i have. Its just wasn't the job i was looking for.
good,This job was a good job I had lots of fun with my manger and staff we had a lot of good days at the warehouse had cook outs also for employees . We had good breaks and stayed busy .

good,At the. the We are able to make connections with our box holders . Coming to work feel as if I'm seeing my good friends each day. We work as a team and we try to achieve higer expectation everyday.
good,"Unload boxes off truck and onto a boxes on conveyor belt."
good,Must want to come to work everyday willing to do phisical work. Job is hard and has long hours during holiday. Once in the union the job gets much better and you gain the ability to much money money.
good,"UPS is outstanding when it comes to employee satisfaction. Employees are expected to work very hard, but it is a very fulfilling job and there is much room for personal growth inside and outside of the company. Everyone is kind and extremely helpful. The hardest part of the job is both the physical labor and time management, but once again, it is a great job. I highly recommend it. Even part time employees get full benefits, great hours, opportunity for growth within the company."
good,"Typical day at work: Slow paced work environment overall"
good,ampliamente enfocada en la satisfaccion del personal con buen reconocimiento salarial y condiciones de trabajo optimas.ya que la exigencia en la productividad es alta
good,"Supervision, Teamwork, Safety, Commitment, Detail, Time sensitive."
good,"For what you work the money is bad "
good,"Everyday was the same routine, load 2000 pieces of items onto two trailers connected to a truck. I learned how to really use my mind and speed when it comes to doing a fast-pace job. Management were always on the go, so it was no slack from either my co-workers or supervisors. This job required full team effort. I enjoyed mostly the great compliments on my work after my shift was done."
good,"Again graveyard just doesn't work, but good work environment and great on the job training.  Potential for better career opportunity if you stick around"
good,"A very challenging place to work! My customers I delivered to our different everyday I deliver early a.m. and Next Day Air packages only I do not deliver ground packages. I drive to Bush Intercontinental Airport every morning. I am very punctual, I could be part-time years ago but have chosen to stay part time. Now at 55 I believe I need to stay part time and find another suitable job to fill the rest of my day!"
good,I wish that I could have made that job last. The pay was great for me as a teenager and having benefits on top of that was awesome. I was always offered other inside jobs which I gladly took up. Everyone was moving up the ladder. It was a tough job but a good job. Management was always there doing their job to make sure we were doing ours safely. I really liked the hours as well. I worked the day shift and went to school at night which UPS helped me pay for.  You literally got paid to work out 5+ hours a day.  Then the worst day of my life happened and I suffered PTSD after saving my family and surviving a deadly house fire. I needed a week to find housing and be there for my remaining family members. Instead of being helpful; the union held it against me and fired me for the time off. They escorted me out of the building like a criminal in front of everyone. I was devastated.
good,"My job is perfect, but i require more for my everyday expenses. I just need more income which is why I am relocating. UPS offered a lot of benefits since they are well known."
good,Good job that gets straight to the point. We picked up 80 pound packages every 5 minutes. When peak season came they let you get more hours. They let you progress if you want to.
good,"Lots of physical movement and lifting"
good,"Great and stable company to work for, plenty of job security and opportunity for growth. The hardest part of the job is getting use to the shifts."
good,"A typical day would be between 5pm-11:30pm. Staffing needs to be right to get the job done. Some employees are key to the operation so that our packages make service on a daily basis. I supervise the International department for our building, our package volume is between 800-1500 shipments that need to be audited by our clerks and be out to their final destinations. Safety 24/7 and following regulations is important for the safety of all UPS workers. The management make my job much easier at ups. They relay on us part time supervisors to make their jobs easier as well. We all have great relationships and help one another. The hardest part of my job is to get all the express level packages to make service, we have a small window to audit 200-300 packages in about 45 minutes before the loading trailers heads out to the nearest airport. Our customers pay a lot of money for these express level packages and they expect to make service on time, if not the company loses money for each service failures we have at the end of the night. The company is abligated to refund the shipping service to he customer. The most enjoyable part of my job is to be around my coworkers, they make my easier and make my reports look good at the of the week. UPS has been good to me in these two years I've worked for them. Nothing but good"
good,"great place to work. good environment."
good,Productive and great place to work. In management our main goal is making sure our people are working safe at all times. Focus on doing what the job ask of us to do on a daily basis.
good,Monday start up at 5 p.m. to 3 a.m. in the morning. Alarm for semi trailer in a line to fuel and wash. Diesel and natural gas truck already to fuel. Pull up to zone. park brake is on. Big climb out of the truck. The inclined back in for both of the tank. Keep safety first always. Try to be alert at all times. safest is always important. And and manage your time well it's very important with this job. Management and is a very important factor. That was my lesson for life. It's very important for me to to get along coworkers. Communication in a smoothie jobs I can't really say it's a hard part of my job. Be careful coming in to do the best job that I ever did I can do. Then I am so fortunate and blessed that I got a job
good,"I love working for ups, the employes and managers/supervisers are very helpfull. They are really big on safety and using the equipment dont get me wrong it has its up and downs but its still a good job"
good,"Very good work area!"
good,"I was able to work for a great company for 30 years. I had the experience of working independently and with others. The hardest part was the physical work, the enjoyable part was meeting people and developing relationships with customers and coworkers."
good,Trucks are always coming with with people's orders and it's our job to make sure it gets off the truck and sort each delivery to its proper location.
good,Fast paced fun place to work if you like hard work. I loved delivering packages for them. They make sure you have engough class room and on the road training before they send you out.
good,Work at ups is like being on a team everyone help everyone we learn how to work faster with each to keep everything moving smooth
good,I have worked at The UPS Store for a while. I was taught new skills that will be relevant in future careers. It was great working here while I went to school as well.
good,"We have fun as much as we work, everyone gets along with each other and understand as a team to get the work done. It's busy everyday and that's a good thing at the job, getting out of work is a good to get out and come back later in the day."
good,very physical job where u either load or unload at least at least 5 to 6 tractor trailers each shift. peak season which is during Christmas time requires more work.
good,"Amazing people and company. Management is amazing , they work around your schedule so if you have school or another job they consider all that. They truly want the best for you."
good,The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the inflow of packages and loading them. The people you work with make it so much more enjoyable and positive. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with others at such a fast paced environment. The managers are so concerned about safety and production. Learned how to time manage a lot better.
good,I loved working at ups and would recommend any of my friends to work at UPS who is presented with an opportunity. Lots of places to move in the company
good,"This is the organisation where you can join and take retirement from the same company. Best place for girls Security and here the policies are the back bone of the organisation.

good,A lot of one on one action with your driver. Meet a lot of new customers and clients everyday. Hard work always moving on your feet to keep up with deliveries.
good,"Working in UPS made me learn plenty of job skills & made me grow within the community. All co-workers made me feel comftable in the job, i really enjoyed my job working with everyone. The hardest part of my job was getting the hang of it & working with the machines but later on it became my favorite."
good,Ups is a good job they got good benefits the work is not so hard its laid back until peak season hit. I had good days everyday at work i loved the job

good,"It is a great company to work with. "
good,"People talk about there own expirences, I have had nothing but good things about ups. You have to have patience, ups hires withing the company, you start as a package handler and move your way up."
good,We only worked 4.5 hours a day Monday-Friday and only got paid 10.35 an hour. Supervisors are nice but some are really lazy. They over work you and time you on going to the bathroom.
good,"It was a great time with ups, and i learned alot in the area of package handling and sorting unloading etc. would always be fun working for ups, and people who work there are good people"
good,"A typical day is a scheduled 4 hour shift. I usually have the option to work the shift before or after as well which I normally do when I have the option to. I am usually on the sort isle but since I've been working at UPS for 4 years I am versatile and can do almost anything when it comes to working inside the warehouse."
good,Every day we had a rush because we had at leas 300 stops a day to deliver. The hard part about the job we had to deliver all packages before it was dark because its hard to see the house number at night time. I enjoyed that job because the other employes made the job easy.
good,It seemed hard at first but the only thing about it was the diad board and the different people you come in contact with on daily basis. the management team is very nice people also.
good,"Great company to work for. Always paid their employees on time and followed company pay rules according to OT and Holiday pay. Staff was easy and very professional to work for,"
good,UPS was a perfect fit for me while I was there. It allowed me to work in the evening get off 6 hours later and still allowed me to have time to continue with the rest of my day without feeling tired or drained.
good,The best part about this job is that you meet plenty of people. You learn many things and the company is great to work for. The hardest part about this job is not being able to satisfy every customer
good,"It is not for the faint of heart. You will be tested, you will be stressed, and you are expected to adapt and overcome."

Must know how to operate Microsoft OS and scanning programs. Co-workers had fun and kept things lively in while unloading. Management was very clear and helpful to employees that were working.
good,A fast paced multiple task challenge daily that is constructive with a goal oriented policy.  Customers concern is the grand priority where a satisfied customer is the only end result achiever.

good,I been working @ UPS for 8 yrs and I enjoy working there. I do package handling I lift and scan packages and put them back on the box line to be put back in the system.
good,"UPS is tough work, but there are good benefits. It's a good side gig, but should not be considered a main source of income if you are going to work part time. Full time is a different story."
good,Great work atmosphere and i would go back again. The early hours i loved and still getting off early enough to go to school or another job
good,UPS is a good place to work and I highly recommend this job to anyone because they also give benefits for their employees and now a days a lot of jobs don't offer that for part time employees.
good,"Shipping out International shipments for customs and imaging."
good,Working for ups is OK don't give you a lot of course only 4/5 a day but it's a cool place to work. It's just hard to get on. But they do offer benefits and they pay for your school if you are in college.
good,"This was a seasonal position, but it was the most exciting experience I had. The driver's were awesome and set a standard for being hard working and dedicated to the job."
good,"Clock in at work and head to a trailer to begin unloading all the packages in a trailer by moving them to a moving belt, when finished move to the next triller until all are done. Hardest part of the job is the strain on your body but by lifting properly you reduce risk of injury."

good,A typical work day is busy and productive. Everything is fast pace and makes the day go by quicker. I have a great manager and friendly co workers as well as all of our drivers and customers. The most enjoyable part of the day is when I get to help someone such as an elderly person with their copies and fax's and they thank me. The hardest part of my day is making sure the paperwork is correct for  every item being shipped and packaged properly. I learned how to improve my multitasking skills and also learned more on Microsoft and Photoshop and improved my editing skills. I learned how to make business card templates and AD posters and much more.

good,"Very great place to work, due to the fact that you're always able to meet great people on a daily basis. You also see interesting things that are shipped out. The store was located in a College area, so most of the co-workers were students or retirees. The most difficult part of the job would be figuring out how to box up strange items for shipping. The enjoyable part would be meeting great customers and forming a relationship with them."
good,I enjoy working at united parcel services. I started working here 8 months ago when my wife and I moved into the area. i would recommend this job to anyone.
good,"Loading packages ; helping others if needed."

Certain times during the day can become stressful due to a heavy amount of people coming in on their lunch breaks, off work, etc... but it goes by pretty quickly if you don't worry or stress about it. Management and coworkers were unbelievably nice. The hardest part of the job was during busy times and seasons as well as making sure to pack all breakable glassware and pieces safely. The most enjoyable part was getting to work with amazing people and getting to know the customers."
good,With all the possibilities in this company you can do whatever you want to do in life. It allows you to go school for free and have a job still. Short work weeks but maximum benefits from the start.
good,Cool place to work. Pay is okay but is balanced by benefits package. Physically challenging. Fast paced and Exciting 5 day work week.

good,I was only a driver helper with UPS. I still could tell how nice it was being employed there. They were very quick getting me trained for the holiday and put me with a driver close to my house to make it easy for me. Over all a very great company to be employed with.
good,"I had a pretty good experience working at UPS, gained a lot knowledge and improve skills. I wish I had a nicer boss though."
good,Working for UPS was a great experience and provided a great workout while moving in and out of the truck.  The overtime was amazing as well.
good,Tough days and long hours but keeps you on your toes and in shape. Had great benefits. Great corporate company to work for if you like to keep it moving.
good,"hird point that is probably the biggest is that UPS drivers usually* don't walk into delivery truck jobs on day one.  You have to work your way up the ladder at UPS before you become a driver.   Generally people start as package handlers in UPS hub and then work their way up to driver.   Working as a package handler is a part time job for 3-5 hrs a day with pay rates around $8-10 per hour.   You may have to work as a handler for years before you get a shot at driving as a temporary driver during the busy Christmas season.   Working your way up to a good job isn't a bad thing.  But the real problem with this is that part time pay for $8-10/hr is not much to support yourself on initially.   And whats more, working as a package handler is extremely hard work.  The job consists of basically moving heavy boxes non stop for several hours.   The UPS.com site says: ""This is a physical, fast-paced position that involves continual lifting, lowering and sliding packages that typically weigh 25 - 35 lbs. and may weigh up to 70 lbs.""   Thats all they do is lift and move boxes.  Most people can not handle it."
good,Working for UPS you have to be very detail oriented being as your main job is to load packages onto a truck in a specific order and place. This job also tested my strength and endurance; with some packages weighing up to 100 lbs. when and if the truck started to become crowded it was also my job to accommodate and readjust accurately and efficiently. I came onto this job in a temporary position and when my time was up I was offered a rare full time position.
good,"ups has good benifits good hours, good money, and its a career job for you to have in the long run.the coworkers is the hardest part of the job. the most enjoyable part of the job would be to satisy to customer and take care of thier package"
good,It was a good experience.Learned the work system fast. Managing fast pace and handling packages with care. Was a good job
good,My time as a package handler for United Parcel Services was well spent. The extra money during Christmas time was great. I would gladly apply next year.
good,UPS is a fast pace environment. I have learned a lot especially about Teamwork.The Management is quiet  acceptable and need to improve more about having good communication with employees.The most enjoyable part is that employees can move up to a certain level of  the management based on experience only.
good,"Wake up at 3 am and go back home by 9 am."
good,"The United Parcel is a great place to work. The job provides rewarding benefits and a high level productive career. UPS is a fun place to work and our supervisors are great people that allow us to work independent. You also is provide with chances to move up in the company from loaders to eventually supervisor, so give UPS a shot you won't be disappointed!!"
good,"La empresa tiene valores arraigados, y es manejada por gente muy capaz"
good,worked hard helping to deliver packages.learned about my community and picked up  more skills. found it very rewarding.
good,"I love Mondays, mostly because the day flies by in a flash. On a given day, during the early hours you will find me speaking to the clients, finding out – proactively – what their priorities are for the week, meeting with team for half hour to communicate the clients’ needs and organizing the team schedules around the client’s priorities. I do this on Monday so that the rest of the week is well organized and we can effectively use our team’s time in exceeding client’s expectations and avoid Friday evening surprises. Rest of the week goes in delivering the product(s), updating the status with the client, answering emails and calls from our global teams. My role involves extensive management responsibilities and staying organized is not an option."
good,the most hardest part of the package handler job is startig the day off picking up a 70 lbs box which is like the heaviest box probably to come on the roller.
good,"Working at UPS was great,this made me very powerful as i had to lift heavy goods all the time and made me very motivated to work in a ongoing/busy/QUICK pace factory."
good,A typical day at work when it is quarter end when you learn how to meet good result on time. If we work hard and honest and respect co workers. it will be fun place to work. nothing is hard as far as we are willing to do it. and when you accomplish your duties end of the day. this is most enjoyble part of job

good,"unload ever single trailer assigned to my belt, in a timely fashion correctly without missing any loads. maintain a clean and sufficient work place, with a positive work environment aimed to keep employees morale up and motivated to do a great job."
good,UPS is a great place to work part time if you are a student.  It is also a great career choice if you are willing to put in the effort and a little sacrifice to get ahead.
good,I am surrounded by positive motivators. At times may run an area if needed. I sort small packages and audit hazmats that go into trucks and planes. So many things to learn even if your not in that position. Over the past few years I have learned other positions just to have the knowledge. Everyone is social at my job so nothing is hard. You ask anyone for help and they will give it. Management are great including the lower supervisor.
good,"As a part time loader some of my fondest work memories are right there on the ""red line"". We had a very tight group of guys that looked after each other."
good,"There was always something to keep me busy working.  I do not like to stand around waiting.  I like to keep busy while at work and working in seasonal shipping UPS during the holiday season, definitely fulfilled that requirement."
good,Wonderful job to have.  It was fast paced and I moved up quickly within the company.  I loved the team I worked with and eventually moved up to Senior Technician and started interviews for Manager within the company.  Due to an illness I gave up my job.
good,Productive and fun workplace Learned a lot about my work co-worker was lovely the most enjoyable when we get together in meeting to learn different things.
good,"If you're looking for a job that you can grow old and retire with, UPS s the job for you.  They are well established and take really good care of the employees.  Their benefits package, no matter what your needs, are easily met.  I love this organization."
good,i really liked working at distillerally the people were very nice and the customers were fantastic i wish i could go back

good,"good sales experience, cashier job, customer service oriented, need to know how to wrap and package goods, be friendly to people, management is great, be a good worker and don't complain"
good,"I was a seasonal Package Handler in the Gainesville Distribution Center.  The one thing you have to understand to make it through the Holidays is, PACING! I saw many people quit within the month or so I was working there. The reason they couldn't hack it is, they just became overwhelmed with the work load.  They internalized the expectations the company holds and became sad or angry when packages were coming so fast, that they were literally getting buried.  "
good,"it was a sunny and warm day."
good,"Hard work, but a great atmosphere where everyone has fun with each other. Very fast paced, but easy to grasp. things can get crazy during holidays, but you get holiday pay and overtime is pretty much guaranteed."
good,UPS hands down was the best job I have ever had. Words can't describe how great this place was to work for. They treated me like family and I appreciate that.
good,The first tee organization that will help the young generation develop their golf game and life skills as well through their nine core values which actually come into play almost everyday of our lives.
good,"I would love to go back and work for UPS at anytime. The hours to start are 3am to 9am only part time for a year before your in the union. There is about a 5 year wait to become a truck driver, which is what you need to make enough money to support a family. A day included running packages to and from the truck, scanning and updating the tracking info, and making sure safety is always your number one priority. Management was just my driver, he was a great guy and we actually became friends afterwords. The hardest part of my job was there is no stopping. You can work 10 hours straight with no restroom or lunch break. Favorite part of the job was the people who received the packages, the people i worked with and being outside all day."
good,Working with great drivers and getting to meet great people along the delivery route. Also made for a good work out being on your feet while running packages.
good,"	Must be adaptive to new tasks in the warehouse."
good,i enjoyed working at ups i loved the drivers and i would work for them any day. i got several hours and made good money. although it was supper cold. some drivers were nice to work with and then i ran into some who would actually would let you do all of there work while they just sat and did nothing.
good,"UPS is a great place to work, if I ever had a chance to go back I would. I still apply for seasonal when school allows me too. My co-workers were great, The hardest part that it didnt continue to permanent. I learned how to stay focus, become more organized and do things in a timely manner."
good,Needed a job so I took it and I worked and got paid for my work. I loaded packages onto trucks that was it. I worked at 3 am and ended at 8.
good,I like the fast pace environment where I was able to learn this type of job assignment.  This was a temporary in which I wish lasted longer.
good,"I was in my mid 40s when I took this job. I had heard that they paid for your schooling. This job allowed me to spend two semesters a Sullivan University. I sorted mail, and pulled packages from the back of trucks. I enjoyed working at the Airport. I was there on 911."

good,a typical day consist of relocating packages from terminal to terminal and adhering to the required timeline for delivery. what i learned at UPS is that they take Punctuality and Safety to a higher level and my managers and co-workers were always there to help me get the job done as safely and quick as possible. the hardest part of the job was dealing with rush hour traffic. the most enjoyable part was the camaraderie that developed with management and co-workers.
good,Working at UPS as a Driver Helper wasn't bad at all. Good pay and good benefits. The other employees were always friendly towards each other and myself included. Management was never a hassle so pretty great experience.
good,"I had a great experience at UPS. the management there was great. We all worked together to get things don and i never had a problem with any of my co-workers or the management while my time there. While working at UPS I've picked up a lot of good traits; Being able to work at a fast and constant pace, while at the same time being efficient and error free, Ups taught me how to be a team player and how to work together with my co-worker to knock out task that may have seemed difficult. I can say the hardest part of working for UPS would of had to be during my training days and I was required to lift packages that weighed over 80-90 and being able to lift them on to the various conveyor belts when tools weren't around to use. Practice makes perfect and it made me stronger and molded me into the hard worker that I am today. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that my team members and I where able to knock out our daily goals of packages that we had to process in a day sooner than what was expected . If i had another opportunity to go back to UPS i would take that offer immediately !"
good,Great Company to work for with semi flexible hours. It has a college program which will pat 100% tuituin for a four year degree

It was a fast paced job, and very physical, considering all the packages were different shapes, some were very big and awkwardly packed and others were small. Finally, the weather would never stop us, the rule is it dosen't matter, rain, sleet, snow, whatever the weather was, you had top deliver that day, and the day wasn't over until the last package was delivered."
good,The location I worked at you had to be a team player. The personnel that I worked with were like family. You have to work very hard and be able to adjust to changes. Very fast pace and can be stressful.
good,Cannot thank the owner enough for helping me become the person I am today. Customers became friends and began to feel like family.

good,Can be very physical at times but worth being in such an amazing environment! All supervisors are down to earth and equipment is acceptable.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be processing, packing up and shipping out packages that customers bring to our store. I also print/fax/copy documents on a daily basis, as well as filing paperwork. What I learned from this job is how the mail system works, and general clerical job duties. Management is the best! I get along great with my other coworkers, everyone pitches in when someone needs help and everyone always gives 100%. The hardest part of my job would be dealing with unhappy customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is the flexible hours and how great of a team my coworkers are!"

If you are willing to start at the bottom and work your way up there are plenty of opportunities to advance and make a good living for your family. I started in management then became a Road Driver, made good money for hard work and retired, no regrets other than I should have done it sooner. As I look back I was blessed  because I had the chance to save a life at a wreck that I came upon in the middle of the night and that was when all of it seemed to be worth all of the hard times I spent on the road for 20 years. Some say experience is the best teacher in life. I say without faith there can be no teacher because for me God has ben my best teacher. I am not sure what job I will be doing for the rest of my life but Trucking and heavy haul is and will always be part of my life. There is a shortage of truck drivers in our country, if you are willing to work hard it is a very rewarding job, just remember when you take hold of that steering wheel on that big rig there is a lot of responsibility that goes with you and you should always be aware of your surroundings so you can make good decisions in any situation you find yourself in, that's what it takes to be a professional driver."

I love the job because of the interaction not only with the drivers but also the customers. Getting to see the joy on their face at Christmas and the relationships the drivers have built is amazing! The co-workers are outstanding. They always have a smile on their face and are willing to help no matter what. If you are interested in a job of this nature. Be prepared for long hours. A lot of labor. Understand that you are going to be out in the elements. You definitely won't have to worry about a gym membership. Remember safety first when delivering the packages to the customers but at the same time. Know how to hustle. You can't be ho hum about it. Be ready to walk a lot and be able to carry at least up to 70 lbs. unassisted. Know that your routes aren't always going to be prestine and nicely paved .

Sometimes the customers were a bit irrational and there was not anything I could do to help them . But this comes with working with the public in retail.

good,"Shif was 6P-3A M-F. Started with shop meeting. We would then go out and figute out what cars we needed to get in for scheduled services. Performed scheduled services. If car needed clutch,brakes, tires, etc, we would do it right then. Coworkers were great. Willing to help out whenever it was needed. Hardest part of job was coming home and getting both boys ready for the day. Most enjoyable part was at the end of the season. Boss said he wanted me to stay on but had open position already filled. Six months later he called with open position. Same schedule as before. Unfortunately I couldn't make it work with wife's schedule."
good,"Very fast paced but enjoyable"
good,"UPS is a one of a kind company.  Although the company is over 100 years old, it still stands by the principals and values of its founder.  It is hard to find these old time values in corporate America today.  Management was clear and direct about the short term and long term goals of the company.  Middle management would ensure that these goals were communicated down to all levels of the company and that the respective teams set tasks and objectives to meet these goals.   Individuals and teams were rewarded well for achieving these goals throughout the year.   The company was very good at taking quarterly assessments and making appropriate adjustments as needed.   "

good,"The culture and management philosophy of UPS was a 100% fit to my way of thinking.  You say what you're going to do and then you do what you said!!  Every manager and employee is accountable to this approach.  We worked together as partners, management by consensus, you speak your mind and then support the final decision.  We tried to treat people fairly and equally, man, woman, black or white.  The review process was always being reviewed and improved.  People were frequently moved around to experience different aspects of the business.  When I first joined UPS I was assigned to the Airline Group in New Jersey as a Project Leader.  UPS had decided to become an airline and replace the six different airline companies operating as contractors for UPS.  I had no airline experience.  I was sent to Sweden for one month to learn the Flight Following software of SAS (Scandinavian Airline System).  My job was to modify that software to accommodate the business philosophy and operating practices of UPS.  We had nine months to complete that project and it was implemented on time and without a hitch.  I was then promoted to Project Manager and relocated to Louisville, where the air hub is located, to take on more airline project development efforts.  When I started with UPS there were a total of about 350 IT folks.  Now, there are about 6,000.  I was part of that massive expansion of IT.  We had to hire a great number of application developers in a very short period.  We created interview teams to help select the right people for the right jobs.  We then had to introduce the new people"

The management was alright they were militarily like I liked it and I didn't like it. My co workers were a real big team. We all had to reach the goal at the end of the night. I would only work 4 hours per night. The hardest part of the job was when I had some random person helping me and we couldn't really work together he/she was going slower paste than I was going. I loved it overall"
good,"All in one a great company to work for.  If I could I would go back to them in a heart beat.  They are very military orientated, and that is one great thing that I like when I departed the Marine Corps and started to work for UPS."

UPS Inc wants its part time employee's to be happy so they actually help pay for you to go to school but for me working nights and going to school during the day was hard to keep up."
good,The job is hard work and aren't really compensated for it. Depending on the hub it would take over ten years to get the advancement that you want it all depends on the seniority  list.

Each morning around 3:30am we would begin loading trucks with oncoming boxes, We as in, my associates but as the morning went on we laughed, talked about life, lessons, the next life move even  joked around while still getting our work done. Im only 21 so I worked with mainly adults, conversations were never dull. I sure knew what aging felt like after seasonal was over. (chuckle) Bust most of all I learned to never stop thinking of the next move."
good,"My job here consisted of sorting mail parcels to ensure the delivery of each individual parcel to the correct location. Management was constantly available and very knowledgeable.

Attended daily PCM meeting with Center Supervisor who advised us of any conditions that needed to be aware of and a daily safety brief.  Really enjoyed working with customers on the route.

good,"UPS offers training to its employees that is second to none. The organization at UPS makes working there very friendly and comfortable. Don't get me wrong, it is work and during the holiday rush, there is plenty to go around. In Feeders, the department that controls the movement of the tractor trailers (and double trailers) that are out on the highway, the work is straight-forward and somewhat repetative. As a casual, you have 2 hours from the time that they call, to get to work. Once you get to work, you punch in (at the time dispatch told you to be there), get your assignment from dispatch, go out to the tractor line, find your assigned tractor, do a pre-trip inspection on your tractor, drive to the section of the yard that your trailer(s) are said to be in, find your trailer(s), hook-up your trailers, pre-trip trailer(s), drive to the outbound lane, check-out, drive to your assigned destination. UPS Feeders operates within 250-300 miles of every major hub (large sortation facility) so that every driver returns to his/her home terminal everyday, barring unseen emergency or weather condition. If you enjoy an environment abundant with order and structure, UPS is the place for you. UPS is the best in package delivery because it has set standards for all of its many operations and all employees follow those standards and procedures to the letter everyday. Assuring that UPS will always be the best, or at least, be among the best in the parcel delivery business. Ensuring that all of its employee will enjoy a safe and secure job. I would gladly go back to UPS if I could count on"
good,"UPS held up to the highest standards for all equipment. Training is constant and exceptional."
good,A typical day at work was inspecting the building and directing employees to ensure that the employees and property was in compliance with OSHA. I learned to have a close personal relationship with the employees and executing team building and leadership. The management team was incredible to work with as well as the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was being able to get the employees to be consistent with answering safety questions during inspections. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a great set of employees.
good,"I have been working for over six years as a part time ramp worker. The job is challenging at times with all the activity and safety issues to be aware of, inclement weather sometimes and lots of airplane traffic. However, fellow co-workers including supervisor's all do their fair share in helping anyone at any time which makes the work enjoyable and sustainable.  There is plenty of opportunity for advancement on the job for everyone who wants to contribute to their own self knowledge and to the overall mission of UPS!  I started in Feeders loading and unloading jets of various sizes ,became a belt loader operator, worked in many different phases of the UPS operation, helped out where I could and managed to get some overtime as I learned various aspects of the job. Your fellow co-workers become your friends because of their cooperation when everybody works together. I  get a great sense of accomplishment at the end of the shift. I have recently trained to become a wing walker and learned to park the airplanes into their respective stations. I enjoy it very much."

good,"I currently work Part-Time from the hours of 4 p.m. to 10 p.m.  I supervise a critical area that involves loading high profile, next day air packages onto a trailer that departs for the airport so that those packages can fly out that same night.  I've learned how to manage all different kinds of personalities and have been the lead supervisor among my peers for the last four years.  The hardest part of my job probably consists of acquiring people to fill in for those that call in sick.  My specific operation starts before other operations do and it can sometimes be difficult to have an employee cover for one that has called in sick.  The most enjoyable part of the job has been meeting all different sorts of people.  We are constantly hiring new employees and sometimes I have to do the training.  It's always a nice feeling when I train an employee and they are able to perform the task on their own without any supervision.  It makes me feel proud as a supervisor.  I like my job at UPS, but with only part-time work and UPS not particularly promoting at this time, I need to find a way to obtain a full-time job/career."

One of the most satisfying parts of the job was the internal customer service. customer service is one thing but to be able to understand and value the ideal of internal customer service is a must. Internal customer service is a soft skill that is hard to gain but a very valuable asset to any establishment. The ability to care for someones products and attempt to provide the customer with out being able to physically see them is close to religion. With that being said the internals of the united parcel service as a package handler was a very rewarding position in witch i showed much pride. Working as a team, as a body, was a must. Day in and day out i was successful not on as one person but together as a unit."

good,"UPS has been one of the largest catalysts in my life. Previous to working here, I had no definitive goals in mind as far my future was concerned. Working at UPS has taught me a discipline I wasn't aware of; the ability to do what has to be done 100% of the time regardless the obstacles; extreme punctuality; the ability to take a situation at face value and break it down into manageable pieces. A typical day for me is to wake up at 2:15 am to be ready and at work by 3:30. I then set up my work area by ensuring the proper trucks are placed in the proper areas, that each truck has its own identifying placard, that all previous discrepancy and missed-delivery packages from the previous shift are removed and run back through the system, followed by a short pre-sort meeting with my employees discussing yesterday's numbers with planned verse actual and where  and what disconnects may have hindered us, followed by recognition of employees that may have hit milestones in their career or just safe behavior in general. Afterwards, I start our operation and packages begin to be processed through my area, being loaded by my loaders. I follow behind these employees, performing method and behavior certifications, OSHA OJH observation forms, as well as picking through the trucks of loaders with a poor performance record to assist in reducing packages being put on the wrong trucks. After four hours of this process in a few various manners, I begin to reduce my staffing and wrap up my work area. After 9 o'clock EST, drivers are dispatched once my Dispatch, On-Road, and Center Managers are satisfied"

good,Work is rough and very strung out. Management is shaky as it is all about running good numbers. Co-workers are fun and you meet new friends while working together to deliver for your customers. The hardest part of the job is the physical strain it involves but it can be enjoyable with the people you work with.
good,"Excelente trabalhar na UPS. Profissionais qualificados, condições de trabalho super favoráveis..."
good,The hardest part of the job is peak-season. This is where the hub gets 3times the amount of packages daily. The thing I love though is that they allow you to come in and work for time and a half the whole time your there. It sure does make you tired but the check is well worth it.

good,At shift start a supervisor would give an overall account of what we had on the schedule and each employee was placed and we worked fast paced in our p0osition until all work was done. Afterwards certain people had the chance to work in other departments or to be a driver-helper. Management and coworkers acted accordingly to get the work done in a timely matter. Everyone worked together. Some of the lifting was the hardest part of the job because of the size of some of the packages but coworkers would pitch in and help others. It was all about team work and that's why I think the company is so successful. The company treats their employees well and inturn the employees do the same for the company. The most enjoyable part o9f the day/season would've been Christmas because we are so busy and face paced that the day goes by so fast that you don't even realize it and the company offers a lot of overtime.

good,"A typical day at work is a great day at work. Your main goal is to please the customer, but also get their packages to them in great condition and on time. What I learned as a seasonal worker at UPS is that a lot of people depend on and love this company. Some people will even treat you like you're a part of their family. I won't really be able to speak about the management because I wasn't there for long, but the people that I did meet at the job were very professional, nice and friendly. The co-workers were great respectable people. There wasn't anything hard about this job. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smiles on the customers faces and being independent knowing every little thing that needed to be done to get the job done successfully."

good,"In this office setting, I start off my day reading e-mails and continuing work that has been incomplete. I report to my supervisor or intern for projects. If they are unavailable or do not have a task for me I go ask certain co-workers if there is anything I could be useful for. As a temp for me the hardest part of this job is keeping busy. There are many days where I am given 1 or 2 mini tasks and have nothing to do in an 8 hour shift. The ebst part of the job is that everyone is trusted to do their work on their time as long as its completed when needed. Therefore, no one is on your case about when to take your breaks, how long, if it was too long. Everyone is at freedom to do their day as they please."

It was easy being a service worker and also working on assignments for my classes and I was very good at multitasking. Also enjoyed principal and students presents during lunch in the office."
good,"Working at UPS is a great part-time job with amazing benefits. The only con is that ""UPS is a part-time job."" In order to become a full-time employee one must rise up the ladder with seniority of years with the company. Life has no time to wait an additional five years until my time comes knocking on my door."
good,"I would start my day off by packing all the big items to get them out of the way. i would then either go help pick items from the shelf so they could be consolidated to get shipped out to the customer, or I would begin packing the small boxes. i would later move to the shipping area to help ship any and all boxes as i could. by midnight all packages had to be shipped that were in the wave."

The management was very helpful, considerate and consistent with the employees. My co-workers were very helpful too. If someone didn't understand or know something, they were there to lend a helping hand. I wouldn't say that there was a hard part, because once you caught on to what you were hired to do, everything just flowed. The most enjoyable learning new thing about how packages get around the world, meeting new people and when you just could take a breather. "

In my region it pays $12.88/hour, you will work about a month during ""peak"" season.  You will meet a driver at a designated place and time and ride with the driver helping to deliver boxes.

What I learned from this is always work hard and fast for an easy day at work. Co-workers where like actual friends that give lots of credit. Hardest part of the job Isn't really that bad because it's not such a hard job, but I would say delivering  too many packages at one place. My favorite part about working for UPS is the friendly environment with co-workers, and customers."
good,"A typical day at work was just like any other, pretty much the same operation with hardly any problems so everyday went smooth.

good,"The hardest part of working at UPS, is the weather, it's a warehouse setting with large overhead doors, so it's very old in the winter, and very hot in the summer, but we always get through it. I love the people I work with, we all have a goal of Teamwork, it's a great atmosphere."
good,"Typical work day included, Being picked up for the duration of the day.Assisting in all deliveries and ensuring that they arive safely and on time. Learned a great deal about customer service and how communication with customers cancreate a pleasant eperiance for both parties.

good,"Had a blast working with the drivers in the Canandaigua, NY area. Was treated professionally as if i worked there full time. The most enjoyable part of the job was enter acting with fun customers whom met you at their doors. I actually worked with part of management because they were short staffed and they were great and always answering questions i had about the company and how it all worked. Hardest part of the job would have to have been some of the weather you would have to work in but if prepared it shouldn't be a problem. All in all i would go back and apply there again when needed without a doubt."
good,I worked 5 yrs. as a loader and unloader then moved up to a small sorter...sorting letters by 400 memorized zip codes. Continued working with UPS after I graduated and was still volunteering with hospice.
good,A typical day on the job would be me going on the road with a driver delivering packages to houses and businesses. I learned how to scan packages on a computer that the drivers have to do every time they deliver a package. The management here was very kind and would help anyone out at any time. The hardest part of this job is when it is freezing outside and you have to deliver in the cold. The most enjoyable part of this job was I got to deliver to a lot of professional athletes and famous people.
good,I came into work and immediately got into my trailer and started loading packages.
good,my typical day at work was interesting i now know places and where they are all over Linden NJ. I learned a lot from working with them. I didn't really work in the building i was on the truck all day. The hardest part of the job was having envelopes on top of the boxes i was carrying and having them always fall off. The enjoyable part of the job was always having something to laugh about. My driver was incredibly funny and ill do anything to have those days back. and its better then sitting home without a job and doing nothing.

good,I loved showing up to work everyday ready to get start. It provided me with great responsibility and had great benefits.
good,A typical day on the truck is delivering packages to homes and companies.
good,"While working as a driver's helper at ups, I learned that you can't slack of nor be careless on the job. What I mean is that you can't text, be careless with customer's packages and you can't be rude. My typical day on the job is to meet the driver at a designated location, give my safety lesson of the day, sign in and start delivering packages. The hardest part of the job is trying not to crack under pressure. For example, I had a customer that I was delivering a package to one day cursed me out because I knocked and ring her doorbell. As a driver or a driver's helper; you have to keep your cool. When you feel that things are going to escalate just drop the package on the customer's porch and take care of the signatures later."
good,"On a daily basis I would supervise 50 individuals, and cook for 1200 individuals. What I learned is that we do have a serious problem here in san diego with so many people being homeless, families, kids single parents its really sad. After moving on I do still talk to my co workers. Hardest part in through my days is seeing the homeless kids. My brightest part of my day is seeing the kids going away with full stomaches."

good,"UPS does have retail stores called ""The UPS Store"" that offer a variety of shipping and packaging solutions. Unfortunately the stores have limited locations and are located mostly in major metropolitan and commercial areas. Packaging charges can get to be expensive and a small business owner would be better off buying supplies and packaging your shipments yourself."
good,Handled packages throughout the warehouse
good,Ups is for people who show commitment and mean what they say when they sign the application. The hardest park i would say is making down time in your section everyday. You know what to expect when unoading a truck. Like the length of the truck or the amount of merchandise that's going to be in a truck. The most enjoyable part of working at Ups is meeting new people and having several opportunities to move up in the employment ladder. Everyday you had to be ready to work and just be on time to do what you have to do. I learned how to effiectively work in a warehouse enviorment.
good,I was just working with the driver dropping off boxes during the holidays.

good,Fast paced and repetitive lifting. Good job for the benefits. Management is fair and Co-workers are easy to get along with. Very important to always remember safety with this job so that you don't injure yourself.
good,"Its is fun to work there. Everyone there is so friendly. They show you the ropes and become such a family. The time is flexible if you have a second job or kids. The pay is good, but it would be better if there were more hours offered."
good,"Good, steady work always, great working environment, great equipment and management."
good,I had the same delivery route for 34 years. I knew everyone on my route and where they liked their packages delivered. The hardest part of my job was the wear and tear on my body.

I learned that working for UPS was more then just delivering packages you got to get to know some of the people you delivered packages for. Co-workers were laid back and fun to be around.

I scan the correct pkgs in the right trailer and build walls of boxes until i fill up the trailer, after filled, i check for the second trailer and scan inside to start the next one."
good,"Working together, fast pace great; sorting package; loading 747 aircraft using K- Loader interesting. ."
good,"Always keeping us busy, management was understandable, co wokers were will to work with, i learned how to ship."
good,work is simple but with simplisaty comes difficulty. It is phyisacly deamanding work.
good,"I meet up with the driver every morning when he'd usually have the truck already loaded. From there we'd head out to deliver to mostly companys in town before we set out on the route to residential houses out in the country. Packages that went to business's or that contained jewelry or alcohol required Signature Releases. With the DIAD board I'd type in the address in which the next package is being shipped to. If the package requires a signature I'll go up an knock or ring the doorbell. If someone is there to sign, I ask them their last name and then punch in the info into the board and record it as a succesful stop. If there is no one at the residence to sign I then write an info notice that says the date, where the package is coming from, who it's for, that a signature was requested, and when we will be back next. There is a 1st attempt, 2nd attempt, and 3rd attempt. After the 3rd attempt if we still have not got anyone to sign, the package is returned to the department where they will have to come pick it up. We also do pick-ups for packages that are being sent out, mostly from warehouses. A typical work day is always fast paced, you're constantly using your strength and conversing with customers in a respectful manner. The hardest part of the job would only have to be lifting something over 100 lbs. The most enjoyable part of the job was the whole daily routine."

good,"Career advancement, cares about it's people, UPS is a large family that stands for all the right things to make sure the customer is taken care of fairly and their compensation for employees is of the highest in the world (I think). A typical day starts early and ends late if you are in management. To run a top rate company you have to be dedicated to your position and make sure that all i's are dotted and all t's are crossed. The management meetings are daily, the co-workers work together, and the hardest part of the job is visiting a customer that had a problem with the delivery of a parcel that was unfortunately damaged. But the most enjoyable part was leaving that customers location with them satisfied with the results of your visit!"
good,"My typical day when working a The UPS Store comprised of selling, organizing procedures, packaging, printing shipping labels, and Managing other workers. Purchased items that needed to be restocked.

good,"UPS has been one of the best jobs that I ever had, I got hired just out of curiosity because I had a flyer on my kitchen counter that I received from my college a year prior to the day that I found it. To make a long story short I called the number and instantly got a response from UPS on how to apply, I followed directions and received a job shortly after without the long interviewing process that some jobs tend to make you go through. The benefits at UPS are amazing! I can honestly say that no job that I ever had has matched or even come close to the benefits package that UPS offers even with me being a part-time worker. Not only do I receive great health benefits I have also received tuition reimbursement from this great company to help pay for my college tuition and books. A typical day at UPS is filled with many tasks, you must be a hard worker at this company or you will find yourself wanting to quit because the work is always continuous which in my opinion is a good thing. My co-workers are the greatest group of people that I ever worked with, there just like you and me, everyday normal people with great personalities. The most enjoyable part of my job is right at the end of the night when all the work is done because thats when I feel really good about the job and how it was completed, in addition to that feeling I also feel good about going home to my wife and kids. Overall this is a great company to work for, I only wish that I would have discovered this company while I was still a teenager because this is the kind of company that you can work a lifetime and retire"
good,Working at UPS was definitely a great learning experience on how to properly deliver packages to a residence/business. My co-workers were very helpful in teaching me with patience.

good,"This passed x-mas season I used to work with a driver that always says ""AIN'T GOT TIME for that"" and also I learned how to tag when people are not in their house or whatever place we go. For 1 week, I used to work with a supervisor that still says ""GOTTA GO, GOTTA GO, GOTTA GO"" and he always motivated me of that saying. Luckily, one of the co-workers that I used to work with back in a pizza parlor recognized me and hopefully he says good stuff about me. The hardest part of the job is your weight because you stop, unbuckle seat belt, get down, deliver or pick up and do the same thing over and over and OVER AGAIN and also be ready with a little snack for the dogs. I enjoyed going to places that I haven't seen before in my city and we would sometimes take turns buying something for lunch and also you feel awesome because you may see a friend on the streets that would admire you from the UPS uniform."

good,Really loved the physical aspect of the job. This high speed and the level of work needed was great.
good,"Upon arriving at work I would immediately be drawn into a meeting with my direct co-workers and supervisor. We would discuss what needed to be done and what each person was in charge of. I learned to respect and appreciate my co-workers because in this environment, team driven work was the key and was required daily to complete any task. My co-workers observed the same set of respect for me as well and we meshed very well. Management was also very sympathetic and did care about us just not as employees, but as human beings. It was one of my most enjoyable jobs because of this."

Training was one on one, all Management team members (the category I fell into) were required to spend 90 days loading/unloading trucks, sorting packages, drive with Drivers and learn first hand all the requirements of the jobs I hired for.
