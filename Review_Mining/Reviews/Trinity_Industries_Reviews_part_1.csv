rating,review
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
bad,They paint a pretty picture and if your a favorite and stay on the road from 2-3 months at a time you can make some money but the management is two faced they tell you they pay one thing then when it’s time for payday they try and pay you something different so you have to complain all the way to the top (legal dept) then when they have to pay you they black list you for making them look bad to seniormangment stay clear from this place it’s about to go under anyway
bad,I promise you on everything that this company does not care about it's employees.  They make many promises that sound so good but in a matter of months you can best believe those promises are trash.
bad,Favouritism is played big time. Managers have no idea what is going on. They all micromanage everyone and make everyone's work environment stressful and confusing. Employees are not appriciated at all. Management has a poor to none ability to manage a monkey. Communication between departments and managment is none existant. HR is a joke and protect the managment even when they try to screw employees over that they dont like. Favorits are played and if you are not a favorite you are singled out and harrassed extensively to the point of quitting. Over all what I'm trying to say is do not work here even if it is a last resort. You will not be appreciated or cared about because you will just be a number to everyone in management.
bad,The Management at Trinity is Rediculous.They treat u like slaves and work the heck out of ya.Plant Manager dont have the nerve to be a Plant manager and assistant Plant Manager is running the place in the ground.If the place is open another couple years it would surprise me.They tell all the new higher everything they wanna hear to get them in ....Would not recommended working there at all I worked there
bad,If you like to work 16 hrs a day 6 days a week with no overtime this is the place for you.if not look somewhere else pay is lousy and job is just ok but not a career
bad,"I loved the the work they had me doing such a strain brakes on at least 5-6 carts a day . They have bad management & and they go by the point system if your late you get a point if your sick it’s a quarter point ... and without steel toe torso boots you’ll get a point for it ."
bad,Coworkers were good and easy to get along with. Management and supervisors are clueless. No communication between any departments. You’re only a number to this company. The only promote yes men there. If you have an opinion about anything you’re wrong.
bad,Nothing nice to say about this company. Let them stay in Mexico. We were undermanned for the job they wanted done. Equipment to work wth was warn out. The parts they wanted put together did not fit.
bad,they have started to import parts from China and Mexico. This dose away with the American workers.This company could stop the imports amd let's us work more than 38  to 40 hours a week The pay is insufficient and insulting. This company doesn't care about its people just how much they can make. The benefits are a joke and experience.
bad,"Worked as a manufacturing engineer and observed a very high turnover rate.  With this company there didn't seem to be much respect for the employees.   Corporate treated the employees  like dogs.   If your were deficit with performance they simply fired you.  Happend quite often.  No re-training or offer to transfer to another position,  basically if you didn't have a high output consistently,  you were gone.  Would not recommend working at trinity rail."
bad,very poor place at the time no advancement no bonus very long hours.  poor work habits poor safety habits everyone looking out for themselves.  worked 7 days a week for 6 months with no time off.
bad,"The people in charge of running the only existing plant in Girard are uneducated idiots. The are responsible for the closure of the other plant . Awful plant management and currently a skeleton crew. Unfortunately one of the plant superintendents is known as a vocational school grad and the other barely made it through high school. And their wages are outrageous for zero education. Such a shame. This was once a viable, high producing company. And their human resource person is a terrible example for someone in this position"
bad,I will never go back it was rthe worst job i ever had. I will not reccommend this job to anyone.I could barely eat working here.Managers and other staffing will treat you unfairly so do not work here
bad,"they make you work like dogs, You're just another number that can be replaced. Tell you they understand you have health problems but are quick to fire you."
bad,"If come in as a machine operator your best bet is to just find a new job. Their hiring process is way too long and not worth it for them to cut you within 3 days of working there. The pay isn't worth the amount of work you do, They don't train you on anything they expect you to know. This was hands down the worst job I have ever had my displeasure working at, Not even because I was let go but because there are other jobs who treat you so much better than they do."
bad,"everyone i know including managers and weld techs moved from this company to sabre industries fwt and as a whole, we all think we made the better decision, even if we all had to take a pay cut"
bad,"All of the managers are brothers or nephews in one family.  There is absolutely no chance for advancement.  I was a certified welder and only got top pay when i complained that people who had not welded until I trained them were getting higher pay than i was. Safety was horrible, I welded in spaces that were confined with no ventilation. I took the job because I had to,  and I'm so glad I am not there anymore."
bad,I was an insulator at this job it was very hot sum days n cold others I enjoyed learning about insulating trains n working wit the welders
bad,"If you want a job with longevity at Trinity Rail you have to know someone on the inside, it seems to me that they hire people that they know. i.e. a high school classmate who know nothing what so ever about recruiting or computers."
bad,this has to of been the worst place I have ever worked for... The employees are treated like trash there is no kind of family values just flat out garbage company
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
bad,Company had to many layoffs was not a secure job . I'm a family man and need stable employment.. Trinity has since down sized to very few employees ..
bad,"The whole shop is filthy. All along the walls of the shop is a pile of dirt from being swept into the wall instead of into a dustpan.. None of the equipment works right. Finding the right setting for welding machine was constant struggle every day.  The floor supervisor was never friendly and he always shot you mean looks like he was trying to intimidate you. Every day I went into this place I feared that I might fall and break my neck over some random object. All of the joints in my fingers hurt from constant welding all day nonstop. My trainer hardly spoke any English so if I wanted to learn something I had to watch but I couldn't ask. He didn't understand the questions I was asking so he couldn't give me a legit answer. The office workers treat the shop workers as if they are beneath them. If you need about $19 an hour job at about 50 hours a week regardless of how dirty you get then this is a job for you. The forklift drivers never even honk their horn's at the sight of a pedestrian. There are no doors on the shop so be prepared to deal with the elements. One worker got pneumonia from being exposed to the cold too long. Like I said if you need money badly, then this is the place for you, but if you actually take pride about where you work then don't work here. And if they see you willing to go the extra mile to get the product out in time all they are going to do is expect that from you all the time and work you harder.be prepared to do a lot of grinding. You'll  probably be grinding for a whole hour at a time almost every day. Then they expect you to crawl inside a narrow"
bad,"worst job ever. human resouce operates like the mickey mouse club. Was hired as an A electrician and was made to perform every craft under the sun. And when complained about not being a CARPENTER, PLUMMER, WELDER, ROOFER, AND A HOST OF OTHER CRAFTS WAS TOLD TO EITHER DO IT OR FIND ANOTHER JOB."
bad,"This is probably the #1 most unorganized place to work in the U.S, with total disregard for employee safety. All forms of management are highly trained in lying. It's believed that lying is actually a requirement to be  a supervisor at Trinity. The place is so mismanaged that  it has no option but to continue to fail , like their stocks and many lawsuits they have recently lost. Girard Trinity is continuously under investigation by both OSHA and Trinity's own ethics committee for  unsafe work environment/practices  and unethical treatment of employees. Management couldn't organize a two car funeral, and you would be treated better at a Nike sweat shop in China. Most employees are fired because they question managements lack of safety concerns, or managements poor attempts at reasonable decision making skills. After years of complaints the employees restroom continued to be neglected and desperately needed repairs to the point that the employees literately took photos of Girard plant supervisors from the company newsletter and placed them in the urinals. Its sad but true, that is what got there attention and some of the repairs were finally made. This place is a three ring circus with no shortage of clowns. Don't waste your time!!!"
bad,"Fill orders for customers,some employees didn't give team support"
bad,"Company is awful,  the office overloads the real workers while sitting in air conditioning and brand new furniture while others use broke equipment and horrible working environments."
bad,All i gotta say is a job is a job!!! thats it in a nutshell had somewat of a good time
bad,"A typical day at work would involve at least a 9 hour day, often 10."
bad,"management operates by intimidation and actually targets employing people with responsibilities.  they expect long hours and depending on the position, may or may not pay the average."
bad,"Good luck .. lol still collecting unemployment from them. Be ready for politics and high school all over again. Best part of the day… I don't think there was one , someone hounding you like a dog looking over your shoulder the whole time , yea. Stuck it out for a year then got laid off because when they said jump, I didn't respond how high. They did not care that I have a 9 month old , all they care about is your submission to someone who has no business supervising there own kid much less a work production line. Don't expect a day off, they have no idea what that is. 7 days a week 10 to 12 hours a day is nice but not when that is your life trust me or don't…."
bad,"They tell you the pay is a certain amount , but when you show up  it's a completely different amout ,  , HR is a complete joke"
bad,Very low pay and lots of hours. The welders are all entry level eelders and put out junk welds. 
bad,"Trintiy Industries does NOT care about you. They are only worried about what the balance of their check book is. They will work you until you are dead and then have you hauled off and then fire you for dying. You are required to work minimum of 12 hr days 7 day per week. You go to work in the heat and cold, try and bust your butt to keep everyone happy, but thats an impossible dream. To many people trying to be bosses and do not have the knowledge to back it up. Stay away from Trinity if you respect yourself."
bad,Terrible place to work.   Easy to replace u and very little training.   Mostly expect u to know what they want or expectations from you.  If you could read minds you'll fit in fine.
bad,Horrible management team. They all want to look good for themselves and steal any improvement ideas you have and claim them as their own. Buildings are in poor shape and the turnover is like a revolving door.
bad,The management is not willing to listen to employees of promote outside employees. The work life balance is is not great and the culture is outdated and not willing to listen to new ideas.
bad,Flooring and grounds were always dirty with debris. short maintenance staff. Not a adequate safe workplace. Cheap PPE. OSHA will have a field day here
bad,"Stuck in the IT stone-age, office politics are way out of hand, at this place it's not what you know or how well you do your job it's WHO you know and how much butt kissing you're willing to do."
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
bad,"This company is stuck in the1980s."
bad,"your job is your life here, dont make plans for the weekend, or any vacation time promised. dont count on that raise you were promised 5 months ago, dont look to the leadmen to be leaders or workers, they are just there complaining at you to hurry up. higher position leaders like to get the employees in groups and complain about hours used, money spent, repairs, ect. ect."
bad,"The recruiter came to my welding school told us they would work with inexperienced welders, then fired my within 30 days. Management is poor and unprofessional my mentor and managers spoke Spanish to each other and English to me. It was a difficult environment to learn only a few helpful humans in this company."
bad,They do not care about the employees and will work you 12+ hours a day 7 days a week if they could. They had us working 12 hours a day 6 days a week when I was there. They frown upon people who request days off or take a point. Management was horrible. They gave butt chewings everyday at the start of the shift. Sometimes they’d pull us out to the lunch room throughout the night for a butt chewing.
bad,one of the most racist jobs Ive ever had with no advancement for people of color and an unfair management and human resource department the pay was decent
bad,HR person is not a certified HR was hired off the street.  Management doesn't tell you what your job is and assumes you know it.  The office is old and dirty and has insects of all kind.
bad,Good foot in the door for the rail industry. Poor management. No accountability. Several employees have been in the industry for their entire lives and enjoy sharing their knowledge.
bad,"The atmosphere is horrible. Bad attitudes everywhere, including the management staff. Pay does not adequately compensate for the tasks being performed."
bad,I worked for trinity for several years and would not return.  They are a very political company and continuously lie to their employees. They make promises and then do not follow through.
bad,"Poor work environment, long hours, weak leadership, no opportunity for advancement. No vision and constant change of vision."
bad,"company layoff, company worked between 55-60 hour weeks. Very minimal employee support from upper management."
bad,All they wanted was production. If your family was sick or spouse was having baby they did not care and would discipline without care or concern for others.
bad,"You arrive at work, assigned a job,then you have to try an make unrealistic production on equipment that is wore out and brakes down all the time.Supervision or management has no clue or common sense when it come to the administering of dailywork or upkeep of equipment.Most of the employees are there trying to make a living but some are the and they bring their prejudgces with them and express them regularly with nothing being done.The hardest part of the job is the tension that is created by supervision with the most enjoyable being the end of the shift."
bad,This company is garbage to work for. They promise you hours then cut everyone back. They’re not reliable and management is generally garbage. They take great people and great workers and crush their spirits. V
bad,If they don’t like you they will do anything to get you outta there . Management is VERY POOR . I was there for a year and there was people that was there before me getting paid more than I did . Plant 19 is a disgrace as a company . Very racist managers . Corporate needs to get more involved in investigating that plant .
bad,"corporate greed. maximum profit all that matters. community second to profit. NOT family friendly. there family fiendly idea was one a one day picnic at the park once a year. They did have profit sharing that could leave your family with a few bucks after you wore worked to death. When i was there they had one guy retire after 40 years, they did not even no was gone for three months after the fact. And then they brought him back for 30 min retirement party. BOTTOM LINE MONEY DRIVEN"
bad,"This company should ashamed of themselves. They treat their employees like trash. They put them in a no win situation for every long hours, very dangerous job. People gets hurt all the time."
bad,"With new management, this place is trash as far as the Truck/trailer shops goes the new forman has never turned a wrench in his life and falls asleep at his desk constantly.The buddy system is in place here"
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
bad,I have worked here for awhile and there is no chance of moving up in this company and if you will be made to do other peoples job while they sit there and watch you do it
bad,"A typical day was usually a full 12 hour day they wanted squeezed into 8-10 hours. Management would become irate if you didn't finish your 12 hour job before 10 hours, yet they preached ""take your time and be safe."" Co-workers who had been there a while just talked trash to the new employees who hadn't gotten it down yet. HR constantly said any negative comments would result in immediate termination, yet nothing was ever enforced when you had to deal with harassment all day. Hardest part of the job was dealing with knowing that just because you started a few months behind someone else, and they changed policies while you were in training, they made double what you made an hour, even if you were a lot better at your job then they were. You could forget about a promotion. Or a raise. They promised if you passed tests to be promoted to the next level you would be, but then they would decline your raise. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving every day."
bad,Lots of potential to do great work but poor leadership won’t allow it. Hard to know who to trust and it’s tough to stand strong and be creative. The company pays well and benefits are good
bad,"management is rude and doesn't look out for their employees or appreciate them. supervisor talks down you just because he has a degree, he lies and try covering his mistakes by lying."
bad,The nick name for this place is slavery industry. They don’t care about the people. Workers are great but over worked under paid they don’t care. Highest rollover I’ve ever seen.
bad,My lead man and supervisor told me they weren't keeping me bc the company didn't want to put me on insurance and give me a pay raise they put everyone through man power as a 90 day cheap labor work mule
bad,I dont really recomend to work here cuz they make with you life whatever they want if you said somenthing they just move you to night shift and if you ask somenthing they dont know and coworkers are like very annoying and rude they don’t like to help cuz they have a lot years work there and they act like owners
bad,"The in fighting between managers was excessive,  made for a very hostile work environment.   "
bad,"Lots of heavy lifting, kneeling, bending. Job is stressful most of the time. If you are hired as a welder, most likely you will do very little to no welding. Team leaders constantly bark out orders in a pretty negative fashion. Very fast paced production environment so everything is rush, rush."
bad,"Huge company, easy to get hired on. They put you through “welding school”. After you finish the training, you get to your assignment to see that it was completely unrelated to what you’re actually doing. There’s no sense of direction. Completely unsafe, working in the dark, almost falling in holes, getting electricuted in the rain. Supervisors are too busy to actually teach you anything and you spend half of the day hunted down equipment."
bad,It was. A great place to work up until a point. Kill yourself for them and no one cares. Get sick and your out like garbage. Karma will get them back.
bad,It all about getting tank cars out the door. Run equipment to failure and work people long hours. Safety is lacking in management due to not being consistent in all aspect.
bad,"The maintenance super wasn't very good and being in a leadership role. The maintenance leader ""electrical engineer"" was very disrespectful when it came to conversing with the other employees. The wages were low and being young and gung ho, they expected way too much from me. Hours were ok and they did pay for some schooling. Overall I'd never work for these people again. Not trinity as a whole just energy absorption in pell city."
bad,I wouldn't trust this company I was lied to and treated like a bad person could get no where with management plus no cool areas to hot in the summer and not enough heat in the winter.
bad,"The politics within the management team makes it difficult to get things done, I was there before and after management changes so I saw it, first hand"
bad,Trinity isnt a great place to work. employee wages are terrible and the job culture isnt healthy. they have a tendency to over work you but the pay doesnt match the responsibility
bad,I worked well. I received 2 points for attendance in 7 months. When I went to rollover with Trinity Rails. I was let go. I was suspended for 7-days upon completion of investigation. Never received a call about my employment status. Just left me jobless
bad,"You never knew how long your day would be, it was too fast paced, management only cared about numbers not safety! They sent product out that was flagged unsafe just to meet numbers. They wanted quality to sign off on unsafe and red flagged products regardless if we didn't pass them for shipment. Quality Manager signed off on knowingly  failed inspections and shipped unsafe products to meet production numbers."
bad,"I learned to be thick skinned working at Trinity. Not a horrible place to work, but the culture there was of mostly older guys who were set in their ways."
bad,I would not recommend trinity to anyone. they are all about who knows who and not a fair employer. I wound up quitting due to the fact I got cussed at for taking off the day my son was born
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
bad,This was a great job & learning experience.  I worked their until they shut down.
bad,"Empresa normal, sin tanto estrés. "
bad,Safety culture changing slowly.  Long work hours are needed to make up for the low salary that this company offers.  Work on weekends are required to make up for salary.
bad,"The company does not treat there employees well, a lot of racial issues still occur there. The Plant manager at Trinity Tank Car in longview texas is not for black people at all. He looks down on the blacks and there is no room for improvement for them."
bad,this is a challenging and fun job I have experienced new friends lots of new skills and an appreciation for hard work the job is very rewarding and also very repititious
bad,"This is a place to go if you are temporarily needing something to pay the bills while finding a new job. The hours are 12+ daily with unrealistic expectations. It's never fast enough or good enough, even when you have surpassed production goals. There are no opportunities to advance unless you are related to or family friends of the supervisors currently there. They don't care anything about you other than you aren't doing enough even when you're meeting all goals."
bad,"The local management is completely disengaged from what goes on in the shop. 7 days a week 12 hour shifts is the norm. Had a 3 day weekend labor day weekend, only because corporate safety stepped in and said there were too many small accidents occurring due to too many days in a row (4 months). Management can't find the money to fix equipment that has been broken for years, however they can find money to remodel their offices. Advancement probably isn't going to happen unless you are a buddy of the department manager."
bad,"No set advancement structure it is pure luck of the draw on whether you are favored or friends that is the only way you move up.  You either conform and stay silent to all the issues within the company or become friends within groups in order to move up. I volunteered and was on a committee.I was the first person to throw my hand up at every opportunity to travel/ gain more experience in order to grow within the company. I cleaned up messes plants created on a daily basis because their turnover is so high due to the lack of structure. I was asked to travel and assist at Job fairs by my manager who gave me such hardship just to get paid my overtime simply because the company wanted to exhaust their resources in order to meet business needs but they did not want to pay up due to budget restrictions. Worked hard and faithfully for a manager that discouraged me and told me, ""You don't want to work for ____ without a given reason."" This corporate company holds core values that are a joke. That is all I will say."
bad,No room for advancement. Worked there for 4 years and put up with childish behavior and no room for upper management advance even with me doing all the maintenance managements job.
bad,a day work at the job is long and hard..i learned a lot like how to blow grit off these cars.and from management is always be on time to work. and from my co-workers is to always do your jobs at all times
bad,Manager in security has no ethics. Tell you one thing do another.  Unless. Your going to be a brown nose don't even apply for security in longview texas.
bad,"Terrible corporate culture,"
bad,Working in a no air conditioned environment during the summer month in Texas is not easy. The management was toward laborers was unprofessional and mean.
bad,"While this company offers a 401k, and a multitude of benefits; It's beneficial to use your own."
bad,"Hard dirty work,low pay,long hours. if this sounds like fun you found the right employer. Trinity bought the company i previously worked for, made promises about safety better equipment, and more pay. So far safety is the only thing that got better but that only lasted until production started to slow down. then we where back in cars grinding 10-12hour days without a hole watch. pay is at the low end for the entire country for welders! I've never seen skilled craftsman treated this way. I'm hitting the road asap. might as well when u never see ur family."
bad,Introduced to welding inspection and became proficient in quality assurance techniques and guidelines. Please see resume for further details.
bad,"Love the job in the beginning. Worked employees like slaves 12 hour days 7 days per week. NEVER did they allow us time off. People started getting hurt because of being exhausted. MGR's and Supervisors took their time off but production was not allowed time off. Co-Workers were great. They had me training others all day at their stations and then ask why I was not at my station. Always had to pick up slack from others. Was not even allowed to take off to take Child to DR. When I first started working there in 2007 everything was great. In the end all of the great hands had quit or been terminated. All new MGR's and Supervisors were not willing to help or do their work, therefore production was always behind. Did not follow through with promises they made to us. Would always come to us an hr before leaving and require even more overtime. Rules changed DAILY. Overall a horrible place to work... Always scared of Layoff"
bad,"Do not work for this company, facility management is the worst I have ever seen. Safety does not exist inside the walls of trinity rail."
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
bad,"No work life balance. They expect you to live there. Typical production environment. Better, faster and cheaper is what they want. There is also a massive disconnect between upper management and what happens or is required on the shop floor"
bad,"It is a job with great potential,  but also with great obstacles culturally to overcome.  Managment staff could make better strides to the environment,  playdate,  and overall culture of the company more conducive to employees needs, if production is to increase significantly."
bad,Pretty much if you are not a welder you are basically at the bottom of the totem poll and your job may or may not be important at that time. They say opportunity of advancement was available but I did not see it. Long work days
bad,"When hired I was told I would be blasting car exteriors, after a few weeks I was pushed to interiors. Was not able to talk with management and most co-workers as they refused to communicate with me."
bad,"Incredibly top heavy organization, poor benefits, average compensation, practically no job security as semi-annual layoffs are the norm due to the ""cyclical"" nature of the business. Depending on your manager you could have a great work/life balance and flex time."
bad,"Help Desk manager was fun off hours but during hours he was a completely person which didn't have to be. I did not expect him to be my best friend. But don't start throwing your employees under the bus to save yourself, and tell everyone its black or white there is no grey. Health INS was expensive"
bad,"long work days, the point system is horrible, management is ok, short breaks and they are very easy to let you go, the company pays well, and they are very tough on safety which is a good thing"
bad,"Again it was hard work and you earned every dollar. It made me want something more in life so when they sent their work to Mexico for cheap labor and closed this plant, I went back to school."
bad,Production was the key word run
bad,"The people i worked with were the only good part of this job, helpful and tried to guide you to things you didn't know so that you wouldn't get hurt on the job"
bad,"Heavy paced job. you are just a number there. worst job"
bad,una empresa inestable con rotacion continua de personal pero con buen salario
bad,Safety is preached throughout the plant but often times it is not followed by the workers. Some of middle management will throw you under the bus to save their necks. the pace is fast and you are expected to perform from day one.
bad,"The work itself isn't difficult. Team working environment. Management can not be trusted. Concerned mostly with it's salaried employees. Promises years of work & or employment for it's employees, but fails to deliver. Jobs assigned or administered by signed & approved contract. If no contract is made available, then there's no work. Highly unreliable & deceptive."
bad,"same routine ,i enjoyed working there cause it was something i loved doing being around machines"
bad,"At Trinity Rail, my job consisted of Joining, fabricating, and repairing metal and other weldable material by applying appropriate welding techniques. Also, Interpreting blueprints, specifications, diagrams or schematics to determine the appropriate welding process for the job."
bad,"Ok....so I worked there over 3 years and got laid off after hurricane Harvey,they put a guy in charge of blast that knew nothing about the blast area we had to tell him what we had to do and he worked there longer than I did I knew it better than he did, the work area was under pressure once he got in supervision."
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
bad,Worked here for the railroad experience and learned a lot but did not like this as a career. I was eager to learn but the training was poor and they didn’t make me feel like a part of the team.
bad,"Open air work environment, management likes to throw the weight in peoples faces instead of civil approach.  Long days (10+ hours) coupled with bad working hours (work day started at 5am)."
bad,"I enjoyed working with the estimating team, but individual recognition is non existent.  The team supported one another and was very congenial and knowledgeable.  A typical day included calls to subcontractors for bids, scoping all trades of the project you worked on, assisting other estimators in tracking vendors or performing quantity takeoffs for them.  Preparing job cpm schedules for others.  The senior estimator was extremely helpful, assisting me through the estimating forms and processes. He appeared to have little or no input with upper management regarding my contributions to bringing in profitable work.   The workplace culture consisted of estimating, which took a back seat to the project management group.  The hardest part of the job was getting  valued recognition for my efforts. There are no salary reviews. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping others learn various aspects of estimating."
bad,I did not enjoy working for Trinity. Communication was poor. Management did not care about employees health and welfare. They do have good benefits however.
bad,Change in management was bad and plant closed in 2015. Company was bought by another company. Most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.
bad,The general workers are great.  Engineering management is poor and lacking direction.  Numerous changes for a startup with no successful results.
bad,This is not a company you can have a family and work at. Layoffs without notice Is the worst plus no communication between management and the employees. Pretty much your just a number. But it is a perfect job for a person without a family
bad,"The pay and benefits were really good. If you didn't work in the production side they couldn't care less about you. Not a lot of job security, they fired a lot of people for unknown reasons. Days off were few for the production crew. Turnover was almost 70% when i left."
bad,"Good pay is the only good thing that I can say about working at Trinity. There hasn’t been a week that I didn’t work 55+ hours. Needless to say, if you work at Trinity, you don’t have much of a life. Most of the time it’s 6 days a week and most people would like to have more than 4 days a month off from work. Management I guess doesn’t understand that. The turn over rate is ridiculous at Trinity. People leave and new people come like clockwork. If you like to work and not have anytime off, go ahead and apply but if you like to spend time with friends and family, I suggest to stay far, far away from Trinity. They care way more about pleasing a customer, than they do about their employees."
bad,Management needs help but employee's are great. Company needs better working conditions. Very very filthy and the bathrooms well worst of than a jail I presume but I've never been in jail so not sure.
bad,"It's a paycheck that's about it. The higher up manager will degrade you and make you feel like your worthless.    Wouldn't recommend unless it's your last choice for employment. Insurance is expensive and doesn't cover much, vacation is a joke as well as their point system for being late or having to go to the doctor. Do not expect any advancement through the company.  However, employees are good to work with."
bad,"Not as professional as I thought, it is not about what you know but who you you know within the company. I really don't have anything else to say about the company,"
bad,"It was close to home at the time, and most of the people were very good about working as a team,"
bad,"Loved the people an the job but management  really doesn't care about its employees  turn over rate is bad because of the work conditions, from holes in the floor to working in all conditions  of weather . Fumes from gasses from acids an zinc, can become overwhelming   an should definitely  pay more then they do for such hazzordist  environment"
bad,"Management has their favorites, jump on the overtime when you can because somedays you are sent home when machines go down or they don't need to run your area.  Benefits are good, lots of stress.  Management plays games and it's hard to advance.  Not everyone plays as a team.   They have no problem asking the world of you but you don't get much in return.  If they ask u to jump u better say how high or u are out..."
bad,Great crew of guys. Decent communication between supervisors and workers. Hard work a lot of mandatory overtime sometimes to much to deal with. the long hours can lead to stress
bad,"Many opportunities to move up."
bad,"Good company to work for , could learn a lot working there. Good place to start working for new welders . Pay rate should be more for the work being done there . Company having trouble getting enough man power to meet production goal. Quality is not enforced like it should . Dangerous environment to work in but safety is always enforced."
bad,"Transit Mix was a good employer.  Unfortunately, the company was sold.  Working for Transit Mix was challenging and fun.  I learned a lot while working for Transit Mix."
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
bad,If you are only worried about money then this is the place for you. The people are nice. Liked my coworkers. HR is where I had my problems. I got sick and missed a few days. I followed their attendance policy and was at a verbal warning. Got fired when I asked about FMLA.  They pay well but your just another number to them.
bad,For the most part a relaxed work day. sign and visually inspect crane before starting work . go over task with crew. assign tasks. pace yourself for a 10 hour shift .
bad,"rolling doors "
bad,"On a typical day I would weld pads on 3 to 4 tanks. Clean up my work station after every tank. Make sure the pad were tacked on right, before starting to weld them on."
bad,If you haven't been with the company for 10+ years you will not be considered one of the insiders and will be passed over time and time again for promotion and/or a decent salary increase.  High employee turnover due to this reason.
good,"Either you work too much overtime or you get laid off. Management is  always pushing for efficiency when all they"
good,Found this to be a great starting point for people in construction.
good,Was able to do and manage the work load in the plant without any Supervision. My QA Manager trusted me and I Trusted him our word was our bond. He Allowed me to set my own overtime Hrs based on the workload in the plant as long as I could Justified the time and the operation.
good,a typical work day at trinity marine was reading blue prints and also welding pieces together and supervisors watching all the time to make sure everyone is working safely.
good,aprendí mucho en esta empresa es difícil conseguir una promoción pero es buena la empresa
good,"Ok place to work for,if only buildings 1,11/2,and building 2 needs exhaust system to suck out carbon,and metal dust out.Install newer machinery in all buildings for better improved production."
good,"Executive management is lacking. Recruiting staff is lacking. If you are somewhat new to upper management, I'ts a good place to develop skills. They have somewhat good benefits, but everyone their is cut throat, meaning they will say and do anything to help them advance."
good,No two days are the same. No chance for advancement. Enjoyed the opportunity to learn different types software loading and testing applications. Did not enjoy working and others get the credit.
good,Trinity ind. Is a fun place but they treat you like a number insteadnof a person. Job security is very low cause they will lay off in a heart beat. They work you till you drop and they don't care about you or your family.
good,Good ole boys place to work worthless lazy people get promoted  hard workers get harassed. Never promotes. The rite people.   Supervisors. Never come out of there offices   Except.  When they wake up   Average.  Insurance and benefits
good,"My work day included servicing forklifts, repairing concrete floors, assembling multi-story racks, and unclogging the occasional sink. I learned that not all vehicles have components in the place you think they should be. The hardest part of this job was being alone all the time."
good,"The overall view I offer to the behaviors and conduct of the management team within this company, would rate a 3, on a scale from 1-10. Foreman on the floor often disrespect the hourly employee, and verbally abusive to the employee."
good,"work schedule is monday through sunday 5 a.m-3:30 p.m..safety meeting early in the morning...10 mintues long,then its straight to hard work..no breaks .breathing in  paint and dust."
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
good,"Talk about caring, but don't show it, especially if it cost money... Say s safety is priority... Exect when need productivity... Productivity is more important!"
good,"There is a lot of back and forth with production and quality. Work gets done according, but there are some slight issues with management from time to time and lack of communication with departments"
good,Is not a bad place to work it if you can handle the heat and handle working so many hours my reason for leaving is that they won't let me move up or learn something new that's just my management I have begged and pleaded but they have told me many times and I have been there for 2 years I'm not asking for more money I'm just ready for a change
good,Lack of communication and organization. And then company fell thru and closed their doors.   There were too many hands in what was suppose to be accomplished or done.
good,Not very laid back or a fun place to be. The work is interesting. The training has been good until all of them went out of business in my state. Keep your resume out there.
good,"Once asked everyone at my lunch table who had graduated high school and who had never been to jail. Only two people had graduated high school and I was the only one who hadn't been to jail. Most of working there is listening to the constant complaints and putting up with the incredible laziness of everyone who works there in the abundant down time. Every job is very easy, except for coil ends which is hard enough for the rest combined, and Hydro which is extremely dangerous. Yet people who are part of the easy jobs still make it their personal goal each day to resist carrying out the few responsibilities they have as much as possible. Management is more interested in their personal interests and those of their friends than they are with getting work done and they have little appreciation for hard work and less reward. If you're a hard worker you will find that you aren't any better off than the slackers. The whole place is corrupt, both of the night superintendents at Plant 110 while I was there were removed for different sorts of fraud. Its just not good place. However, if you really need a job, it is easy to get on and they will pay to train you, then within a couple months, you can be making 16+ an hour, which isn't too bad for East Texas. They also have benefits. So if you're desperate like I was, it's not that bad; it's just not a long term thing."
good,"Many of the management staff at Trinity Rail are undereducated for their positions.  They operate in old fashioned management techniques, and make it difficult for advancement.  Employees are paid more than other industries in the area, but the work environment is a bit more grueling than most industries also."
good,"The company is a good place to work if you want to work 6 to 7 days a week, 10+ hours a day."
good,"It is a good company to work but depends in which plant you are. "
good,Its a decent place to work.. Good people and decent benefits.. very physically demanding and not weather controlled so be prepared to be really hot in the summer and really cold in the winter.
good,"The pay is good but the conditions you'll have to work in are less than acceptable. Tough, hard work everyday for 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. Wouldn't be terrible if the heat wasn't so bad."
good,very fast paced long hours decent pay over 20+ an hour starting if you have experience management is ehh..... ok at times they claim its not about production but its all about production and numbers you will get written up or moved to another position if you cant keep up with the line do you job collect your check  paid weekly and you will be fine very hot in the summer winter is not so bad as you keep very busy and always moving everything  needed for your job is supplied overall good pay  lots of hours but it is contract work so layoffs are normal
good,Trinity Rail can be a very stressful place to work. the relationship between workers and management is almost nonexistent. employees that i developed a relationship with all feel expendable.
good,"Trinity is okay while the businesses good, but when the business slows down then they began to lay people off, and it seems to me it be when when we really need the money"
good,Need to Change the Culture for the employees.  Long hours with very early start time and late nights.  You don't leave until the production has been ran.
good,"A typical day at trinity when I arrive to work I had to be clocked in by 6 pm lead man would notify everyone where they were working at. most days I worked in the shear room where we had to measure post cut it and punch it and send it out to the line. We have safety rules that must be followed to ensure that we don't get hurt. I learned how to drive a forklift measure rail, load and unload trucks. I found most of management to be lacking they all had favorites that could get away with anything while others got in trouble for doing the same exact thing. I got along great with my co-workers in fact most of the time if my co-workers found they were having a problem with another co-worker or the way they were being mistreated, or problems with machines ect. They would come to me and I would speak to the lead man or foreman, and we'd try to fix the problem. I really don't feel anything was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a great day and Me and some of my coworkers broke the high record for the shear room 4 times.I worked with different men every time but I was included every time."
good,"Not a very organized job, they only been in the pole busy for three years now. Work alot of hours but when it's slow and it will get slow. They will try to find any reason to write you up just to get you out of there."
good,"I enjoy a company that does employee recognition, company luncheons, bonuses, etc., I want to be in a position to where I can use my skills that I've learned through out the years and apply those skills to help save my company money and time all in a safe manner. I'm real big on safety, think twice before doing job or pushing that button for example. I'm always wanting to learn something new and I'm that guy who will do that job that no one else wants to do. I see that as rewarding and shows leadership to do what ever it takes to get the job done. SAFELY."
good,"-Un día típico en el trabajo es la forma de trabajar que es muy profesional de cada uno de los empleados."
good,"se recibe el turno ya las responsabiliddaes de cada grupo o rabajador se asignan por parte del suoerrvisor, se revisa el plan de trabajo y se  revisan los inventarios de las partes del carro a utilizar,, se entregan cada 6 horas dos carro completo armado y soldados,"
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
good,"Work started off fairly well.  It took time to learn my around the plant and observe all of the different things going on.  After that it was a lot of paperwork, training and meeting with other managers.  The first two years went reasonably smooth, but after that there was big slow down in production, primarily due to the reduction in oil prices.  The company made inland water barges the that largest percentage consisted of oil barges.  With that came a reduction in people.  At the pinnacle of my stay I had 6  people working for me in the Safety Department.  That number kept dwindling until a year later I was a one many department.  I still had the same workload as before but I was putting in more hours and not getting anywhere.  My performance suffered and I was ultimately terminated for unsatisfactory performance."
good,"Productivity seemed to be number one, minimal planning, employees were somewhat kept at a ""need to know basis"". Hardest part of job was waiting until the last minute to improve pit roads in order to make job run smoother. Workplace culture was very stressful when working 70 plus hours a week,"
good,"Poor upper and middle management. Management does not listen to employees with concerns. Leaving staff unappreciated, overwhelmed and frustrated. Very unorganized."
good,"Fast paced. If you work hard and are a good worker, you will get the reward of doing other people's work so they can slack off. Good pay, but you never know how long it's gonna last."
good,"Very stressful . Worked many hours including on many occasions mandatory overtime. "
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo sin tanto estrés laboral.
good,alta rotacion de personal por cambio en el flujo de trabajo
good,As far as a job goes it's decent if you like to work a lot of hours and be subject to a layoff. The management team is subpar but coworkers are great. Nepotism and favoritism run rampant throughout the company. When the orders pick up it's 7 days a week 12 hours a day for months at a time. I worked more than 6 months without a day off.
good,facilidad de aprendisaje y desarro de  habilidades segun aptitudes
good,"Same thing every day, pay was good but very boring job.  Seemed to work on a buddy system for advancement. Long hours but good pay on overtime.  They didn't seem to care about family life."
good,"Enjoyed working with tenured people, but there is little potential for growth. Stable company."
good,"They give multiple opportunities to try different positions and learn new things, but... Working 12 hour shifts, 5-7 days a week... Layoff numbers are low because they hold onto temporary workers and contractors until they slow down. And when they slow down, they drop hours so you get a max of 40 hours. I have a hard time just taking care of my pets. Other people barely see their kids especially if they work nights."
good,Always working never have time with familia or amigos es hard to have a life but money es pretty good when you’re working all the time but es either working all the tine or laid off
good,"If it weren't for the good pay and healthcare I would have quit a long time ago. Advancement opportunities only for the favorites. Overworked and made to feel bad when you need to take the day off. Generally, as long as you work your butt off and don't step on any toes they will keep you and pay you well."
good,Trinity Industries is going through a Spin off and laid off a lot of good employees including myself. My manager did not have any experience and therefore our department suffered
good,"good pay but you had to work 12 hrs a day and hardly get to see your family. a lot of people cheating on there spouses at that company. long hours, hardly home and they played favorites. you could have all kinds of experience and no write ups and get passed over for someone just because they kiss folks butts.. HR is horrible in that place, they micro manage all the managers in that place and if they don't like an employee they will dig and find any reason to get you fired.. my advice is to do your job, stay to yourself and don't make friends in that place unless you want to kiss a bosses butt to move up.. females forget about it, they treat you like property in that place because females are in there sleeping with whoever they can to move up the tiny ladder they are given.. makes it hard on the other females who wont sleep around to move up.."
good,"Es una empresa con una estabilidad muy buena, pero con salarios muy bajos y jornadas de trabajo muy pesadas, así como el ambiente laboral no muy bueno. Se presta a buenas oportunidades de crecimiento en cuanto a los puestos de trabajo."
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
good,"I like the people, they really care."
good,Nothing I could see myself doing for a long period Of time that wasn't for me security wasn't for me  so i had to change my career the supervisor at the time didn't know how to talk to his employees that's one of the big reasons why I had to change my career also but Trinity in the security office was  different
good,This is a good place to work. I loved the job and the people are so nice and helpful. The only thing is there is no job security. I have been laid off from this company twice because of lack of work.
good,"Trinity Rail was a blessing to me and my family financially and it continued to be that for the duration of my time at this place of business. A typical day at work was fast paced and repetitious. The process of my particular job was easy to catch on to. The managers were hardly present, there were lead men who took their place as overseer when management was absent. I got along with all of my co-workers for the sake of an productive work day. The hardest part about the job was dealing with how the facility functioned; lack of resources, leadership, motivation, and solid planning. The most enjoyable. part about my job was working beside my co-workers"
good,"From an IT perspective, IT is almost an after thought.  CEO prefers to extend the use of hardware and software systems well beyond the system life expectancy, resulting is a lot of ""band aids"" to make things work, and obviously little to no support from the manufacturers due to old and outdated gear."
good,"I pulled parts by number primed the parts ,I put the parts together to  make train ends. A and B ends the hardest thing was all the lifting . the co workers all got along"
good,"Learned a lot starting from my time as intern until I signed on after graduating in December of 2012. Have gained valuable experience over the last four years, and enjoyed what I did.I went from being an Industrial Engineer to a Manufacturing Engineer in about a year. For the most part it was a very laid back atmosphere for being a manufacturing facility. My fellow coworkers, from the administration down to the hourly associates made it a fun place to work. The only bad part is knowing that come August or September every year, you would get a WARN notice saying in 60 days we are starting the layoffs."
good,People are nice but no job security.  Many hours that you don't get paid for if your a salary Employee. Employees that work for you end up making more then the supervisors. Goals are set very high and hard too achieve.
good,"I have been employed for over a year. There is opportunities to advance if you are in the click. A typical work day is 12 plus hours and average 74 hours a week. The company pretends to be concerned about a balanced work/ family life but in the end; production always comes first."
good,Its a high production work environment. The work load changes and can be hard to have a healthy balance between work and home.
good,"Still new here but it's an ok place to work.  Pay is very low but benefits are decent."
good,"es una empresa que cuenta con muchas areas de oportunidad, y se ve crecimiento mui facilmente dependiendo de tu desempeño"
good,"A typical day at work was spent 'putting out fires'. Preventative maintenance was implemented as time allowed. Production was pushed and equipment was abused, so there were frequent breakdowns."
good,was a good company to work for. unfortunately the went out of buisness in my area at time
good,"the money is good, the benefits are great, fellow employees are cool, management is ok to subpar, not enough time for family"
good,"The money is good, the benefits are great, but the job security is subpar."
good,"muy buen ambiente de trabajo aveces como todo trabajo momentos tranquilos, cargados de trabajo, horario accesible buenos compañeros"
good,I liked what I did at my job and done it most of the time well. The management was not that great because if you aren't a part of there click then they would find a way to get rid of you no matter how good a worker you are. The pay and benefits are good.
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
good,Great place to work if you don't mind being hot and or cold all day. Great experience welding and fitting parts together. Although it's a very fast work environment and they don't like mistakes to happen. It could cost you you life.
good,It was a security job. I have no ill feelings towards this job or the company. Might go back with a new career as a truck driver. The manager I had was fantastic.
good,It was a job. They had a lot of good people there as well as bad. Lower tiered and upper management played favorites. You mostly knew when you were going home. It was good for what it was. It paid pretty well for the area.
good,"A typical day at work depends on the day and how you structured your work time.  Management is very supportive and understanding. My co workers are friendly and professional. The hardest part of the job is having to create your own workload. The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility."
good,Anyone that wants to work and is eager to learn trinity will help them become a better welder advancement opportunity is abundant seeing how the turnover is fairly high due to the amount of hours worked per week and the vast inexperience of new employees
good,"Low staffing, too many residents to one aid. Overall I would rate this company three stars because my needs as an aid were not taken into consideration."
good,buen trabajo que te permite tener mayor conociemientos en el area metal mecanico
good,The first few months as a Security Officer went smoothly. The learning of the information and aspect of the job was easy to handle. Management and other employees were knowledgeable to help more technical questions/concerns.
good,I’ve learned leadership skills and helping other welders meet the production goals. I believe leadership and respect is earned through hard work and standing out amongst others in the work shop. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing everything passed QA.
good,"el trabajo a realizar es que las prensas o la linea este trabajando debidamente aprendi a maniobrar plataformas de elevacion, algo de relevacion a manejar montacargas. la gerencia se preocupa por su gente la cultura laboral esta en proceso con lo de seguridad para bienestar de uno mismo y familiar, y lo que mas me gusto del trabajo es que hacia lo que me gustaba (trabajar de electrico)"
good,"Work well with others, training new employee and paper work, fast pace...set up work for 2nd shift.."
good,"Trinity of navasota is agreat place to work the co workers are awesome, Inspectors are always on the hot seat your job is on the line daily if your an inspector"
good,"Inventory control, productions planning, time keeper, Material planning."
good,"Not much on job security, left my last job to return to work at Trinity just for them to promise 10 years of work and only stay open less than three years."
good,It's not consistent with work. There is not much room for advancement . The company has had two lay offs in my time there. Management could use more training skills when dealing with workers.
good,"I was a contractual and working with Trinity Industries for a short time helped me build my self confidence especially dealing with high/senior level management, sharing my knowledge in Oracle and helping them in the conversion of the Accounting System."
good,I enjoyed working so close to home and I enjoyed my coworkers and working four ten hour days a week. Having time with my family on the weekends was a perk.
good,"a typical day at trinity rail for me was basic, I delivered the parts need to build tank carts when was called on the radio. Over all easy and good pay for the work I did"
good,I enjoyed the people I worked around. but the management needs to work on getting out that slave mentality
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
good,A typical day of work is busy but the management of employees was not so great.  I worked hard and had to make up for the slack of other workers while management did not discipline or try to ensure all workers were doing their jobs fairly.
good,"pay was good, many lay-offs occurred, which left the feeling of non-secure"
good,"Hard physical work, long hours"
good,"This is a good company to work for but it’s not family oriented!! You work lots of hours, spend no time"
good,"The company was one of the best I have worked for. Management was good, the employees were good. The only bad thing is that they closed their business."
good,Great place to work for stability and building a network within a strong industry. Many of the people at Trinity have been there for many years which speaks to the culture of the company.  The overall benefits of the company are great and they really put forth an effort to ensure employees are taken care of.
good,I actually enjoined my job with trinity there is just no balance with life when you work every day of the week for 12 hours. This is what made trinity un enjoyable for me
good,Better pay ...better benefits... better hours ..working with inmates. Is not an Easy task it requires an individual to be strong-minded Focus for the demand it's extremely dangerous in environment that is  very violent.
good,Trinity is going through to many changes and has had multiple lay offs in the past 4 years i was there. i would not recommend working here if you are looking for good pay or a long term job. most employees are not treated as fair as they say that they are.
good,Great opportunity for program growth and process improvements.  Company required too many pilot programs prior to developing and implementing new programs.
good,"lots of opportunities to excel"
good,"i gave 100 percent to this job daily i loved it and the people there, i tried to stay and they layed me off. i would like to go back but i have yet to hear from them. i gave them some of my best years and im fighting to keep my home and vehicles now because of them. wish them the best."
good,Nothing about working for Trinity is too difficult. They pay well and the benefits are good. The work culture desperately needs to be improved. There is a borderline abusive relationship between some upper management and others.
good,fast pace work was always coming and going. upper management was good but supervisors needed a lot of help. coworkers was great to work with made lots good friends
good,I love the work an the employees. Its a nice workplace very structured. One of the best jobs i ever worked. Its a place i would consider to retire from.
good,ofrecen muy buenos cursos para la superacion del empleado.
good,"Working there was a challenge everything had to be perfect and it was just too much stress for myself. Sometimes when the job  “messy” they wouldn’t give you enough money to cover all the time you spend on the job, I felt many times that I would clean the condos the right way yet they wouldn’t pay what they were suppose to."
good,learned a new and different skill set higher level of responsibility taught how yo use overhead crane although the work environment was challenging learned a strong sense of responsibility
good,No one worked together information evasive - safety and everything it meant did not exist - finish each day safely paramount for your well being and family sake
good,Trabajo muy dinámico pero poca capacitación para desarrollarte.
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
good,"Relaxed but fast-paced. Management didn't need to push employees because the environment was good."

good,"a typical day of work include finishing up the work first shift had started. After completion, start our assigned jackets. Once finished, go help another department."
good,Oportunidad de crecimiento y aprendizaje. Trabajo en equipo.
good,"Management was uncertain. Promised advancement, however, didn't have authority to make promises. Insignificant, neither positive or negative to provide."
good,Typical work day consist of safety meetings everyday and go over the gameplan for the days work. The hardest part of the day is finding an inspector to okay my work. The most enjoyable part of the day is the hour lunch talking to my co-workers.
good,Consistency was difficult due to acquisitions and mergers; some shops were union and others non-union.  Increases and promotions were given on company politics and favortism and not geared towards your performance.
good,Good Paying job. but you gone work for ever Penny. good coworkers. Fun places To work had a lot of good times there its can never. Stay up an running for some reason
good,its all about accountability doing your job safely in way that you ensure the work is done properly and effectively so you can return home to your family
good,"Un dia comun en la empresa es tranquilo, el ambiente de trabajo es bueno ya que es interesante la preocupacion que tiene por sus empleados."
good,the most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked around and the job was never the same from day to day.The equipment that I worked on ranged from overhead cranes to welding machines.
good,"It was hard work and the days went by really fast. I was a welder at this company and enjoyed every minute of it."
good,Es una empresa con una alta capacidad de adaptación al cambio en terminos de manufactura y con la capacidad de diversificar sus productos y sus especificaciones.
good,"6-430 or 6 your preference"
good,Its good company to work for. It as its ups and downs just like any other places does. The guys in the shop are good guys to work with.
good,"6/12s a week, work was based off production. enjoyed being busy, didn't like working night shift. employees were well to work with, and productive."
good,Well we always started the day with saftey meeting discuss any saftey hazards help keep everyone safe on shift after lunch we meet again everybody got along worked as a team hrdest thing was me getting welding down i had the grinder a lot bonus chk every three months excellent
good,Safety Practices were not consistent of what was said in Safety Orientation. No one took safety seriously and would not listen to safety concerns.
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
good,"A typical day working for Trinity is just making sure that the whole team is working together and making sure all the tanks were welded to perfection, and that they were shipped out in a timely manner."
good,"It was a good , NEW experience for me being in the Railcar Industry."
good,"typically at Trinity Rail in saginaw your work schedule is 50 hours per week. I worked the 2nd shift I would arrive at 4:30pm and work until 3:00am. We would break for a 50 minute break at 8:30pm, 30 minutes of it was your meal break, the remaining 20 minutes were two allotted 10 minute breaks in one. I was a little shaky when it came to FCAW but they have an onsite school house and after one week and 200lbs of weld metal I became quite proficient at 3G/F and 4G/F. I worked in the production area as a welder II, the work was simple as long as you could follow the instructions. It felt good to get as many cars done from your station."
good,Great place to work and very fast pace.  Long days however you are never bored.  Projects and tasks.  Close one month and then its time to close another.
good,Great coworkers but supervisors don't stand up for coworkers and they do not evaluate when they are suppose too. They also don't pay you for your skills when its time to evaluate you
good,"Fine until i had gottten moved to  a position  i didn't want, other than  that the people and work were fine."
good,"starting my day I have to layout clips on rail car, after welding tank I had to hydro test it ! if there was any leaks you have to rep[air with stick."
good,"This was a great company, but the upper management from corporate was slightly more complacent than I would have liked. I enjoyed working with everyone in the company and I gained a great deal of experience working here. I gained knowledge of VPP operations and audits. I also added to my list of certifications while I was there."
good,A typical day at work was coming in and having to report to the supervisor's off on some nick-pick stuff that happened the day before.
good,"mucha presion, mucho tiempo de trabajo y no te reconocen el tiempo extra aparte"
good,"No days off really to spend with your family, long hours, no team work, big turnover rate, dangerous, unorganized at times and they could pay a little better."
good,Les falta más seguridad y limpieza y arreglar máquinas de soldar
good,"They provide unlimited overtime while they have a large contract order to fill. Otherwise, be very careful. Could have them railroad you with write ups until dismissed."
good,I liked working there just lost tramsportation so it was hard to get back and forth to work and after that i couldnt get transportation and quit from there cause i couldnt get there
good,cool place to work learned how to operate sub arc machine and fitting up them big cans the hardest part of the job was the shift i was on (nights) the people were alright
good,"Very fast paste, we are in the production business so we’re constant trying to hit our numbers goal. Hardest part is probably the hours and being night shift, best part is the job itself isn’t too hard."
good,El ambiente laboral es bueno se aprende de forma rapida solo falta mas personal en algunas areas para ser ma eficiente el trabajo la mayor parte del tiempo es trabajo bajo presion
good,Good company to work for they just have to many lay-offs due to lack of work great pay great benefits good people great hr helpful and quick to get you answers
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
good,Trinity was a decent company to work at for anyone that would like an opportunity.  You can find your niche within Trinity just by finding the right department.
good,Tienes la oportunidad de aprender de cero ya que cuentan con una escuela de soldadura
good,Good place to work. They pay and benefits were good. I was able to move up fast here within in the 2 years I was here. I gained all of my welder experience at this worksite.
good,I got a lot of experience by working there and it also taught me a lot on being a better and more productive welder so I would definitely recommend on working there to become a better welder
good,"The people I worked with were great.  The people on the business side and leadership from the business side were really great to work with.  IT is usually in a state of Flux which is good and bad depending on which side of that line you are on.  They are improving in IT, but it still may take a while.  They require you in the office everyday, so if you are not close this will wear on you quickly.  Overall benefits are good compared to other companies in the space."
good,"Was an excellent employer when I started there. Used to be Syro Steel. Place has gotten worse and worse ever since Trinity took over. They took away incentive jobs, Reduced benefits, took away profit sharing and reduced wages. Had 2 plants in Girard, one is now closed, costing the area fifty or so jobs and the 2nd  plant has all but shut down. at present they only have a skeleton crew on. Sorry, just can't think of any real positives here. They can't seem to understand, you need to spend some money to make money. All equipment is run down and not properly maintained. They say they care about their employees.......they have a strange way of showing it."
good,good work balance and good work easy schedule.  5 days work week  some weekends. lots of advancements with in the company. and good safety record.
good,"People at Trinity in the Rail Division are generally good.  A lot of complacency, though.  Employees weren't actively developed.  Even worse, those showing promise were not given opportunities.  A classic case study of old-boys club."
good,"Average work place dealing with your typical production job problems, but overall I lived working here. Worked with great people, and the benefits aren't that bad. Had an injury once while working they took care of it no problem. Recieved my raises when I was promised them without any problems. The only problem is layoffs quite often. Working there was feast or famine. When there was work the money was great, but when the lay off came around hours were cut and that's when it got hard."
good,"What I remember most about Trinity Industries is the great people there. I am still in touch with some of them today."
good,"Decent work when company is busy. When business is slow, layoffs tend to happen.. a lot of ""behind closed doors"" convos between bosses. Open door policy is just a thought"
good,"Was a ok place to work, a lot of miss leading information floats around. Also did make a lot of friends who I still call my good friends."
good,Good environment but job secrity is a must. I like the family vibe but at the end f the day we are all here for the money. 9.75 just wasnt enough. and i got layed off after two months
good,"llegar saludar y empesar con la platica de 5 min."
good,"El personal es comúnmente muy armónico para trabajar, es decir, se tiene facilidad para trabajar en equipo."
good,"This job is fun and management was good to all employees."
good,"Great place to build weld experience. It is a fast paced production plant. MIG weld 1, 2, 3, and 4G on train tanks. Follow safety procedures and wear all proper PPE at all times."
good,learned how to work fabricating machines.  good management.  nice coworkers.  hard work and good pay.
good,"A typical day at work included: printing out a sales order report, identifying which product was to be shipped first, determine who the customer wanted their carrier to be, had banding employees get product ready for shipment and ensured product was correct with the correct quantity being shipped. I went into this position not knowing what to expect and I learned so much from the knowledge that I did gain. I enjoyed the co-workers that I worked with. The hardest part about working in a warehouse is being able to remain calm while working in a hectic working environment. I enjoyed being on the phone and dealing with truck drivers and hope to find another job doing the same type of work."
good,"Good place to work. Slow paced work environment, not very adept at using latest technologies."
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
good,"Solid company to work for, as evidenced by the long service of its employees.  Manufacturing culture is present even in the corporate office.  Great people."
good,Only thing that's really good about Trinity is the benefits  and pay. Alot should be took upon consideration. Doctor notes are not accepted at Trinity
good,Nothing negative to say. Great work/life balance. Overall company values its employees. Great time off during holidays. l have nothing more to add to this review
good,"High paced work environment, Fun and challenging."
good,"Trinity Industries (Houston Texas) location was a steel bridge construction facility.  Estimated 200 employees at this location.  Also had responsibility of 35 employee facility as well.  "
good,"A typical day at work was challenging, innovative and creative.  I learned a lot about its IT dept and systems.  Management was wonderful, very approachable, communicative and involved with its staff.  Workplace culture was motivational, cooperative, and productive.  The hardest part of the job was to be dressed in a conservative business attire every day.   The most enjoyable part of the job was everything.  I liked working there."
good,"Manejar capital humano"
good,"Good people. Comparable pay. Continually improving to establish best practices industry wide. Multiple businesses under a corporation, so there are opportunities to learn or transition into other business units. Longstanding history in industry, which lends to stability."
good,"First, I read the blue print.  After that,  I check all the parts of a tank to make sure everything is correct.  I also check the thickness of the tanks.  Then lay out, I check and make sure all the dimensions, level, square and well out match the same on the blue prints and then I tack them and make sure to double check that everything is good.  "
good,"en esta empresa es muy accesible en cuestion a Materia Prima en general, puesto que cualquier cosa que necesites desde un lapiz hasta un archivero o desde una herramienta de mano hasta una maquina de produccion, se proporciona."
good,As long as you got your work done then the day was easy.Typical work schedule. lots of employee feed back was encouraged for better environment.wonderful Management in my department.
good,Management is poor one day one thing is acceptable the very next it’s not. And if you find your self in a hot seat don’t expect help from your supervisor and managers they will throw you under the bus so fast. No team wholeness. Especially in QA department
good,"Like other industrial workplaces, Trinity is not for the faint of heart. If you dn't meet production, they get on your case. If you do, they increase the workload. They'll work you practically to death to try and make production. However, despite how bad that sounds, they keep you around (at least for a while) with great pay. They make you earn that pay with the rigors of industrial work. You come in, you clock in, you show up for the safety meetings, and you work with heavy metal objects. You'll work yourself out even if you don't get much overtime, so if you start here, make it count."
good,"Good benefits. Long hours and place shut down. Good pay at the time. I,worked there so long ago I don't know what there like now. Good company to start with."
good,"Aprendí mucho laboralmente."
good,"I learned how to repair, retool, program and successfully operate a CNC plasma cutting table. The work was done on a factory floor with an assembly line configuration. Very little management interaction if there were no problems in your sector."
good,Steel guard rail company hard work worth the money and benefits easy going environment management is alil iffy but not that bad. Wish I could go back kink f they would let me
good,If you like working at a fast pace non stop welding environment well this is the job for u. The work is repetitive once u get done with your part well its time to send it to the next jig using the overhead crane. Everyone was pretty friendly and u typically don't work alone being there is so much welding per part. The hardest part of the job was the PUSH you had to hurry up with your part cause your fixing to get another as soon as your done. We tried finishing our part in a timely matter so when we where threw we can load next piece on our jig instead of having parts laying everywhere.
good,Good company to get certified within different welding  types .Trinity has great benefits as well Nice management ande good work environment . Prefer assembly work Great Option
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
good,"Pay was poor, well below average for area. Expected to work 12 hrs per day 7 days a week, no time off at all."
good,Manufacturing facility for rail cars. No longer in operation.
good,The job doesn't require much knowledge or experience to do. As long as you have a positive attitude and is willing to learn then it's for you. There isn't much growth opportunity so if you need something stable it's ok.
good,On an average day I work ten hours and with my experience I can work either in exterior blast or interior blast since I've been with this company eleven years I've learned about rail car movement I've learned about confined space and have had training in confined space aswell our management team needs improvement due the buddy system and favoritism so the culture there is not balanced fairly.the hardest part of the job to me was learning all I needed to know but as far as the work it was quite simple.what I've enjoyed about this job is the raffles we have and the fact it's a stable place that pays pretty good
good,"I liked that I got to travel with the position that I held. My specific working group was lacking in certain areas, especially upper management and in my opinion they held too many unnecessary meetings which interfered with day to day working operations."
good,"Solo hallaban la manera de ponerte reportes por tu mal trabajo y nunca había alguna gratificación o alguna felicitación por nuestro buen desempeño laboral, siempre eran regaños."
good,"un día típico en el trabajo.-"
good,Environment fast paced and dangerous. Salary was below standard for position and duties. Environment was pleasant and fellow employees worked good together.
good,"Started as data entry person, the company was switching to a new computer system. Input inventory, created reports for assembly and production. Assisted in inventory and receiving, filed jobs. The programmer was training me so I could fill in when they not there. The company decided to switch the type of program that the programmer was using. Due to layoffs I was given the job of programmer and issued the disks to the workers outside for production. I was also still doing data entry, receiving and inventory."
good,"Large company with small company feel.  One of the few places that still offers hoiday bonuses, winshare (gainshare) quaterly and quartly employee luncheons!"
good,"""Trinity rail is on the New York Stock Exchange.  They dont care about you or me; they care about effing money"".  I'm ok with that.  We all care about money."
good,"It is like an extended family."
good,45 years working there good times bad times times but raised a family working there and the job was nice and close to home and they worked with me if I had a family obligation or family problem
good,I was lead to believe i was going to be working 4 10 hour days a week with overtime as an option. It eneded up being 10 or 12 hr days 5 to 6 days a week. Not givin an option usually. Ended up falling asleep driving to work and totaling my vehicle. Missed too many days so that was it for me. I did enjoy workimg their when being well rested and not feeling over worked.i learned a lot while there.
good,"Great place to learn and understand the industry. If your applying to work in the Railcar division there are a variety of opportunies from welding, assembling, to NDE. If y0u show a willingness to learn abide by their core values then they will teach and train you for available positions you may not qualify for."
good,The work pace is fast. The hours are long although as long as you are welding they don't feel all that bad most days. It is a very loud environment but they'll supply you with most everything that you need to get your job done. It may seem chaotic but it is a very efficient work place.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, gente tratable, una empresa que me hizo crecer en lo personal debido a la exigencia y demanda de trabajo dentro de ella, crecimiento en el manejo de personal y en el trabajo bajo presion."
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
good,"I enjoyed working for Trinity Industries. Work was challenging and I got involve in different projects, and it helps me to learn a lot. Also I got a chance to work with well experiences people in the industry."
good,"Aprendí a trabajar con personal, así como a capacitarlos para su rol."
good,I learned how to weld and sand blast and how to work\ drive a forklift my co-workers where like family the hardest part of my job was othing I loved and enjoyed what I did for a living
good,me desarrolle como jefe de seguridad  recibí muyb buena capacitación
good,"i miss that job, the was good, the supervises was cool to work for."
good,Nice company to work for but I was a temp. This was a company to try to retire with.
good,"A typical day- I check up to 15 or more rail cars at 3 different stage of manufacturing a day."
good,"The human resource personnel are the best ever. The supervisors are not. All of my coworkers were  some of the best people to work with, and other coworkers were nto."
good,"Trabajo estresante para el cumplimiento de los programas, buen ambiente laboral, mano de obra excelente, falta mejorar las áreas de trabajo, buenas prestaciones, se puede mejorar aún más la seguridad, equipos y herramientas."
good,"Trinity is established in the railroad industry.  They have several long tenure employees which equals a resistance to change, but they are trying to address that."
good,Safety is of the utmost importance. Harsh and diverse environment containing ultra skilled tradesmen. Employees must be Multi-Crafted and Multitasking regardless of weather. The team ensured that production was up and running within 2 weeks of 2010's 500 year flood.
good,"Overall the job was what I liked to do, keeping busy and using my skills to better the company and production. I definitely learned and attained more knowledge about production and different machinery used to complete different tasks."
good,Esure the workers are operating within the Safety Guidelines per the requirements of Trinity Industries.  In addition to the above I co-teach orientation to the new employees.
good,"This job was a great place for anybody wanting to learn new and advanced welding skills that are going to be put through rigorous testing, and the pay was substantially higher than most places due to the long hours required of the workforce, because they have only two shifts working the twenty-four hour production line each day and you will work regularly seven days each week."
good,"good place to work. "
good,"Morning meeting we would go over goals for today, discuss production from day before, go over any new or current safety rules and be reminded to work safe."
good,Trinity seems.to be a good place to work and treat people pretty fair. They treated me pretty good.I think they have good benefits and work with there employees
good,"nos dieron un curso de la iso ,aprendi sobre las normas"
good,"I was a forklift operator .and a mechanic helper.very fast pace enviroment,learned several things working for trinity,hvac,replace machinery parts,also contained clean areas around the warehouse"
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
good,"buen compañerismo,siempre teniamos capasitacion en todas las areas aopyo para nuestros hijos estudiantes,oportunidades de sobresalir no muchas,el trabajar tiempo extra ya que traia a mi familia un mejor beneficio economico"
good,"Actividades diarias que absorben tu tiempo, capacitación diaria y constante para tus labores, ambiente laboral amigable, personal competente y acostumbrados a manejo de estés diario."
good,happy with all ive learned in this place sadly we got layed off because of gas prices ..but i feel ready to continue my career in welding and go as far as i can ..
good,I would pack various materials using a forklift. I would load and unload trucks as needed. Learned better people skills by meeting new people every day that was picking up loads. Liked all of my coworkers
good,"encourages diversity and great place to work. A lot of opportunity for growth, good people and pleasant coworkers"
good,Learned machine shop methods and techniques for making railroad parts. Management was very courteous and knowledgeable in telling employees what to do. Co-workers encouraged success. Hardest part was getting laid off. Most enjoyable part was I was the first ISO 9000 certified employee out of 1050.
good,"the people are nice, laid back, and a organized company to work for. it is a great starter job to get some experience. and the pay is decent."
good,"gathering information from clients, assessing their insurance needs and risk profile."
good,"They expect a lot from there workers, but seem to understand when u need some family time. If your not ready to work hard then this is not the place for you."
good,I was the only one on our line who had over time accumulated. My best friend now was my supervisor back then. We had to be time efficient to keep production Quota at the end of the day. We accomplished this by working together as a team on the assembly line. The best part about the job was unity as a group and the ten hour shifts.
good,Learned how to handle customer complaints on a higher level. Dealt with concerns from the viewpoint of my company and those of the customers. Got trained in welding and fitting while here.
good,"Good place to work while the doors are open.  It is a dirty and hot environment, but what do you expect out off a place that build trains. I liked working there and it's a great place to develop skills."
good,"read blueprints,gather materials, build top platforms for railcars. Mig weld and cutting torch experienced."
good,Productive workflow. Learned how to operate various machines. Management trains worker well. Co-workers are easy to get along with. Hardest part of drive was the commute. Most enjoyable part was being able to operate machinery with confidence.
good,Welded steel components of rail cars and performed other various tasks.
good,"Typical 12hr shift (night)"
good,the company it self is a good company but some of the management and HR staff at the plant where i worked were unreasonable and culturally biased
good,"I run a sub-arc welder and make large cans for rail car barrels that can carry various fluids. The steel can range from .450"" to 1.5"" thick. each can I construct can be broken down into 6 steps; 1. load can in bay 2. postion and weld the inside of the can. 3. roll the can up and gauge a path along the seam on the exterior of the can. 4. roll the can up and run a pass on the outside ensuring that both welds meet. 5. roll the can down again to cut off the runoff tabs. 6. push the can out of the bay. Repeat this process on average 10-14 times a night. While at this job I have also learned the whole procedure of making a rail car though this plant. From several flat peices of steel to a barrel ready for paint and fittings. How to run a Blaster to clean the plate, Plasma to cut it to the right dementions, assisted in the rolling of the cans, I run the longseam currently, run the ABU which runs a sub-arc welder through the interior of the barrel joining the cans, run the Outside Gert which gouges and welds the exterior of the barrel, and I have helped hang the heads which make up the ends of the barrel. As well as assisted in final which is the station which goes over any mistakes that are made. The managment on nights is pretty lax and detatched. My co-workers are a rowdy bunch and take some getting used to. Hardest part of the job is the hours, not so much the amout as it is how late. Most enjoyable part of the job is payday."
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
good,"Most of the management has been there a while and they just do what they have to ""it rolls downhill"" as they say high turnover rate."
good,come into work stock your station and pre pair for your shift. working in the drive thru you mainly just take orders and take money and hand out food. when its slow you clean and stock your station and clean and stock the back rooms.
good,Hot days but learned how to weldhardes part eas being in hot ppe all day
good,Work load will constantly keep you busy. Over time hours are great. I like that cross training for other positions isn’t impossible to do and will add other opportunities
good,Nice company to work for very friendly and great people only downfall is the low pay. The opportunity for overtime is there but do to high turnover do to low pay. Great job for retired person or student if money is not issue physical work is light so not taxing on the person body.
good,What I enjoyed the most about the job was I had fun and it wasn't boring to the point I wanted to fall asleep. Great company and management to work at
good,Es una gran empresa y se preocupa por sus empleados mas sin En cambio sus dirigentes dejan mucho que desear
good,working for trinity industries was great. learned many things from many different people. only problem was when it came time for pay raises only the people upper management liked got them. Didnt matter if they worked all day or just stood around.
good,"This was a good environment and they really strive to embody a team/family environment.  I always felt as if they really appreciated the work I was doing, and they do care about their employees."
good,It is hard work at the cleaning rack it pays very well there are good benefits. But it is an unhealthy place to work. Consumes a lot of time and tires you out.
good,"It was a pleasant, stable work environment. People are eager to pass on what they know. The employees were well supported by management. I would reccomend a job in this company to anyone looking for a pleasant work experience."
good,"while working at trinity i began to learn the necessary skill to farther my career in food /dish washing. "
good,"Great company and great people but there is no opportunity for growth or advancement"
good,"Some departments are fast paced. The department I was in worked 7 days a week, 3 1/2 days on 3 1/2 off. You work either day or nights, only rotate off weekends every other month. One month you may work 7 days straight but your pay period breaks that in half so its two 40 1/2 hr. pay periods, but next month you have off 7 days, but still get paid because those are two off periods back to back, so its like getting 6 weeks off during a year. No top outs on pay 4 bonuses a yr"
good,"Good company, wish pay was a little higher. Good management hours can be inconsistent. Very big facility. Co-workers are easy to get along with and management as well"
good,"Buena disciplina de trabajo, salario justo, oportunidad de crecimiento, lastima que existan favoritismos injustos y sea una empresa inestable"
good,Trinity has great benefits offered to its employees. Lots of overtime opportunity on Saturdays. Nice group of people to work around on the shop floor and office.

good,"puntualidad y asisitencia indispensables, tranajo desde inicio bajo presion."
good,"Use of forklifts in movement of material and parts"
good,Trinityrail was a great job with plenty of learning experiences and changes. I didn't like the fact that the job was temporary. Tho given the opportunity to work there as a career job it would have been top of the line.
good,"Other than working around a bunch of welders it was a alright job. Management was changing when I left, but everybody had a help out attitude which made things a little easier."
good,"Most of the management is shifty. There were also a few great leaders that got looked over. All in all, the culture of the people there is what makes you want to stay. Though its closed now, its a job and experience that I will miss."
good,"Trinity was a well organized facility with good workers, great lead men, and well detailed jobs. Has great benefits that comes with the job which helps the employees a lot."
good,"levantarse a las 4 de la mañana , y salir casi a las 8 de la noche .. "
good,It was a good jo at the time with decent management. not much time to be with family. hard work but decent pay.Usually only had one day a week off. people were friendly and fun to work with.
good,"Learning how to work as a team, in extreme temperatures. Not letting your emotions or co-workers get the best of you while on the job. The hardest part of the job was the extreme temperatures. The most enjoyable part of my job during my time at Trinity Industries, was working as a team to overcome a variety of obstacles to get the job done."
good,fine company to work with I really need to be basetied close to my home. My wifes health is not that good so I really need to be able to get home when I can.
good,"The company has many opportunities for advancement and growth. "
good,"A typical day at trinity consists of running report, analyzing data, and effectively making decisions for sourcing and procurement of materials."
good,"Overall I had a great time at Trinity industries, the environment was pleasant and co-workers were the best Ive had, made many close friends at Trinity. The work was intense and fast paced like any other big manufacturer. But that helped build time managing skills which has been of great importance through my career."
good,"worked on very large industrial equipment, good learning opportunities"
good,"I learned a lot of skills working for Trininty Rail. The hardest part of my job was that it kept me away from my family SO much. I enjoyed  learning different trades the most. The managment was ok, and the co-workers tolerable."
good,Me gusto que me puedo superarme fácilmente en lo profecional
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
good,Even do I don’t recommend it for it to be a place to work for a long term it is a place to get experience for the future they help you learn welding or to operate machinery.
good,"Aunque te esfuerces no te toman en cuenta, apenas ir alas carnes asadas y abrirle la cerveza al jefe, así subieron muchos de puesto."
good,"Safety is at the forefront for Trinity. Respirators are always mandatory when welding, as is the hard hat and jacket. It gets very, very hot inside the big metal building. Use the 1/2 gallon jug they give you, and go to sleep early. Attendance is also a very strict policy there."
good,They work was easy however the supervisor are rude and work u to death it was great working on my truck however when they throw u on two or three tracks a night and expect u to finish 8 cars in the same time u finish five is a little hectic
good,"Start my day with a toolbox talk concerning safety, followed by a meeting with management over any safety  issues that may have arose. Frequent walk around looking for hazardous situations and ensuring employees wore correct PPE while performing job duties."
good,I am surrounded by the very best people who bring out the best in each other. We all work together without any drama. I love going to work everyday. It not a job when you are having fun.
good,Proactive safety program with somewhat competitive pay. Moderate family to work balance. Generous benefits package. Genuine personal concern from upper management.
good,cada uno realiza sus actividades como corresponden
good,The job was perfect with a good crew. Not many things I could say bad about it. The job helped me provide for my family and the work hours were good. It taught me new skills and made me understand what I was working for.
good,"If you have a skill or not they will train you.  If money is your goal they have long hours, a very production based co. If you live close it alright to be there.  They have great benefits."
good,"What is not to love about welding!? This is a hot job depending on the department that you apply for. It is a fast paced job ( depending on department and position). The time I worked for Trinity I had already had welding and torch cutting expirience so I moved around quite a bit. A lot of work, a lot of rework from less expirienced welders but all in all, great benefits and great pay."
good,Loved working there. Good Job. Lots of steady work. Good atmosphere. Management was ok. I liked how there was always plenty to learn and you had to move fast to make daily quotas. I miss it.
good,"Definitely not for the soft. It was one the best jobs I've had, slackers weren't tolerated and you earned your position nothing was handed out to favorites."
good,"Buen Ambiente de trabajo, hay oportunidad de crecimiento y excelente empresa"
good,"Nice paying job with a friendly atmosphere with opportunities to advance and show off various skills such as painting, crane operating, welding, and installation"
good,Like working there because you can do a lot of things different. they will lay off people but depends on what Trinity  you are work for. But so far good company
good,"Good benefits, good management, good safety procedures but work can be slightly strenuous. Some exposure to weather elements but a good job to grow into a career"
good,La mejor experiencia para trabajar con retos de contrataciones masivas y en general con el desarrollo del Capital Humano activo en planta.
good,"Great employee based company with strong growth opprotunity. Trinity is an industry leading company in the steel manufacturing environment. High standard in safey, quality and production."
good,"I scheduled fabrication within the plant, as well as shipments out of the plant.  Ran reports for what needed to be galvanized for shipments.  Backup to shipping/receiving and to data entry of production.  Co-workers, had an issue with a new employee, she was causing trouble with other co-workers.  While i was off for surgery she took it upon herself to take part of my job away.  The hardest part of my job was learning a new system MRP.  No one else new this at the current plant. Always had to call others to help answer any questions.  I had no back up help if i was off.  The plant manager had no clue about MRP and I would come back to a mess.  The most enjoyable was the guys in the plant were a great help.  I showed them what i needed and they got the job done."
good,This was a great job. Benefits where exceptional. Management needed work. People get promoted due to favoritism and some promoted due to accusing race just to get the job.
good,After working full time for over 5 years I grew to love my job. I worked with a really good crew and management was productive and efficient.
good,Trinity has ok pay and benefits. its a very fast paced work pace and the number mean everything to them. some of the supervisors are great people on and off the clock. but it is a scary place to work due to maint issues
good,"Llegar hacer una lista de las cosas que tengo que hacer en el día."

good,I worked for trinity industries as a heavy assembly machinist classificatio B2 for almost three years. In that time my experience with this company was overall very satisfying and I would certainly consider working for them again almost without hesitation. The only draw-backs I can think of worth mentioning that are not to be expected of an industrial job of this type would be that more often then not communication was not what it could have been and often times the left hand had no idea what the right foot was doing so things got done rather oddly some times.

At least it wasn’t for me or anyone else I worked with. Pay is competitive and benefits as well, BUT take advantage of the tuition reimbursement they offer. You will need a degree to advance."
good,"Great company to work for. Seasoned management team with great leadership and opportunities. Lacks company culture. The most enjoyable part of my job would be that you don’t do the same work day after day, if you’re good at your role you wear multiple “hats” and leadership quickly takes notice and puts you on various projects"

good,Excellant place to work. Strong communication. Friendly atmosphere. Lots of opportunity to control own work practices to completion and strong backing by plant manager and corporate controller.

good,Trinity Rail is a railroad car manufacturer located in southwest Oklahoma City. I first started work at Trinity as a second shift shop employee. During that time I learned a great deal about how rail cars are actually built. When an opening in the Manufacturing Services Department I was approached to see if i would be interested in the position of Tooling Designer. I was impressed that they preferred to promote from within. The management and co-workers were all more than willing to explain the processes and procedures of rail car manufacturing. I was very disappointed when the plant was closed due a business slump.

good,"A typical day would be cleaning up, servicing equipment, checking numbers and measurements. I learned a lot about how to service, clean and work mining equipment and heavy machinery. The management is great, they help out as much as they can. They are there 5 days of the week, and they are good about understanding things you are struggling with and strive to get you in a position that best works for you and the company. The hardest part of the job would definitely be the heat that comes from the kiln and having to work in the kiln, especially in the summer. The winter makes it hard to because it is an outside job. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the great people and how we all have to work as a team to keep the plant going. the bosses put together prize drawings for those who do good or work over time."

good,my day starts out clocking in then going to my station to set up production to get started for the day I do about 2 to 3 tankcars a day and by the end of the day we set up for the night shift and ends my day. What I learn there is a lot of pointers from guys that been there more than 10 yrs and there very helpful. It makes my production a lot faster. The management there is not all that great because i tell them something needs improvement and wont get improve till months. I say the hardest part of my job is doing the tankcar by myself because i have a partner but he is more of a slacker and i pretty much get stuck doing everything.
