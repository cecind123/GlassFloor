rating,review
bad,"This company came in and acquired a family run business and is now running it into the ground."
bad,The site supervisors along with HR were very tough to deal with. Very negative environment created by site management that just trickledown throughout the work site.
bad,"Unless you belong to the management pot. Oh the co-works are fine group of hard working people, unfortunately they don't last very long, makes one wonder why!"
bad,"If you don't kiss up to people you will not get anywhere with the  Harvey division. Superior is a really good company to work for just don't join the Harvey division you will regret it trust me, I use to work there go to well service or any other division and you will be ok avoid The slickline division in Harvey at all cost."
bad,"There is NO SCHEDULE you do not know from one day to the next what day off you might have.. seriously then they text you two hours or less before work and say you have the day off...."
bad,"Long hours, no set schedule and a hostile work environment. Managers write people up without investigating first. You are told the day before if you work the next day or not so you can't make any plans.  Zero organization. This company is always hiring drivers and your starting wage is your only wage. They do not give raises. Horrible company. Just don't do it."
bad,The worst job I have ever had.  Favoritism is your only way to move up.  Getting a raise is non existent in that company.  Have unqualified people in management positions.  The positive was the health and dental benefits.  Some people could get as much overtime as they wanted and others it was blasphemy to ask for overtime.
bad,Very unsafe culture and a habit of putting poor performers into management positions.
bad,"I worked for Warrior Energy for two week. They are owned by Superior Energy. I was told to take a safety class,which I did and passed 3 classes. The 4th safety class I took at Falck in Brookshire. I learned nothing because the instructor flew through the safety materials because he wanted to leave early.  After given the test I failed. That was no surprise. I spoke to the supervisor there and she told me she would allow a retake and I could read the book then take the test. After 45 minutes passed the instructor came back in and told me I had to stop reading and retake the test because he had to go. Even though I was not finished reading.  I failed by a few questions.  I reported this to Warriors Supervision and Safety Instuctor. 20 minutes later I was fired. When asked to speak with HR Iwas told to call a number in Louisiana that nobody ever answers. Most of the reviews are right. Management sucks. They never even checked out my story and I never spoke to anyone. They have maybe 8 guys that have been there for over a year everybody else 3 months or less. What is wrong here. A lot of there driver's walked out on them. If this is such a great place why did they leave and check out there safety rates for Warrior and you tell me what are these guys learning at Falck."
bad,"Me contrataron por tiempo indeterminado, haciéndome renunciar a un trabajo previo estable, y me ofrecieron un retiro voluntario a los 3 meses, dejándome sin trabajo. Había desorganización desde mucho antes de mi ingreso, y a pesar de haber armado un equipo de trabajo que pretendía mejorar las cosas, mostrando algunos buenos resultados a corto plazo, optaron por suprimir casi todos los puestos de mandos medios del segmento, donde me incluyeron a pesar de los pocos meses que llevaba en la empresa."
bad,Enjoyed learning new things but no one was willing to teach the correct ways of building insulation blankets and management was horrible
bad,we work long hours stay away from home days at a time and management does not care who gets hurt as long as the customer is happy and not calling complaing about the mismanagement of the business IE we made a promise we forgot or didn't have resources to keep
bad,I applied for a HR position that I am well qualified for and can't get them to even look at me.  They keep posting the same job over and over.  For a Company this big it seems they would be in need of someone like me with my experience and background.
bad,Inexperienced insecure management tends to flex muscles when it feels threatened by people with more knowledge.
bad,They cater to people who play on their phones all day and walk around for 2-3 hours a day chit chatting. There is no incentive to work because doing your job and hard work gets you nothing there.
bad,This place was very unorganized and changed my direct management 8 times in 3 years .. and the location management at least 5 times.. It is very difficult to stay motivated and excited with promises that are never kept..
bad,"mergers have taken a toll on values,,,  bobcat high pressure control was the true benchmark!"
bad,Stay working never slack and hope for a day off never get down and keep strong you will finally move up but never give up on what you want in the end.
bad,"Otima oportunidade de experiencia no mercado de trabalho, agregando experiencia e valores a serem levados na carreira aoo longo da vida."
bad,"Superior Energy was a very poorly managed company from the top.  However, there is a very good atmosphere between employees and my superiors were very flexible on work schedules.  It was a very family friendly atmosphere however, the administrative groups who were non management had no incentive to improve.  I never had goals or performance reviews and never saw where the overall company had goals or targets to aim for as a whole.  The company from my perspective approached change with a ready, fire, aim mentality."
bad,"A typical day at work varies. On a slow day, most technicians sit at the computer surfing the web for hours. On a heavy day, the same, only a few technicians work non-stop and stay past hours to complete tasks."
bad,"I enjoyed learning a new accounting program, I also learned about DOT regulations.  I stayed very busy and had many diversified tasks.  The hardest part of the job was the family relations on the chain of command and some unique challenges."
good,If you need a job thats the place to go but I wouldn't recommend them as a Long term company.Communication is something that needs to be addressed
good,"a typical day was left in my hands to handle every aspect of daily operations."
good,Management no willing to listen to any issues as in regards to staff treatment of personal. If you keep your mouth shut you will go far in the company
good,Needs more organization and team building. Lack a team spirit and drive of attaining goals for the company and employees.  Putting a plan in place for all would be a great start to unity and success.
good,"when busy, things were great. as work started to slow down managements true colors came threw. lots of finger pointing, and politics,"
good,"No one is appreciated by directors or VP or HR.  You either know people and can get raises and advancement or you get 2% every year except when oil is down.  Then you get nothing.  4 years without a pay raise since oil dropped.  Employee's are fun and make work worth going to if you're looking for a fun family environment, but upper management don't allow much fun outside of your co-workers.  Extra curricular activities were all denied by VP even after approved by safety manager and company insurance."
good,"Work in the beginning was fun until all the division did a re-org of all the management.  The staff that was there before all the new management came in were treated like they were the enemy.  The hardest part of the job was working with all the changes of the new management to only go back to doing things the old way.  There was no room for growth, but the overall the co-workers I had were pleasant and made it easier to come to work."
good,"•	Execute engineering calculation"
good,Great place to work. People are awesome.  Leadership unstable. 
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work at all when I first started then over time new management came in, replaced everyone and started stripping our days off, housing, guaranteed hours and everything else that got me to come here to begin with. Now they act like we should just be walking on eggshells and kissing feet just to say we're employed there."
good,Good organization for transition or starting career if you do not have experience within oil and gas field or organizations in the gulf coast or offshore.
good,"Empresa boa de trabalhar juntamente com os outros colegas de trabalho, onde formamos uma família muito boa, aprendi inúmeras atribuições, como teste de alta pressão e montagem de equipamentos."
good,"Constant micro management, Giving chances to work alone and present ideas, but the rules always seem to change from Month to Month. Felt undermined when giving a task to complete."
good,"I would go into the shop and rebuild bops and slick line tools."
good,"Superior is a good company with knowledgable employees, that provides great services to the oil and gas sector while staying competitive in todays tough market."
good,I enjoy working with my co-workers. As any position it has its ups and downs. You learn to put your head down and work and do your very best.
good,"Good company with solid growth. The cementing/pressure pumping division is slowly transitioning from a small family operation to a corporate, big business model with improving HR policies and better equipment/training. Pay is good for field supervisors but kind of low for bulk truck drivers (operator 1's and 2's)."
good,"Good company but too many individual branches following different guidelines. Not being able to get supplies when needed, poor maintenance on vehicles.Would rather company test for competency when promoting."
good,"They pay for training  classes for all your certifications in order to go offshore. Allow employees to work in shop to make extra money."
good,We commissioned the Spill Response Vessel Arctic Challenger for Shell Oil. It was a hoot. Very advanced technology in the hands of children! Well not quite but there was a feeling of celebratory times while there which led to good bonding.
good,They bought and sold companies at whim and didn't really care how it affected their employees financially or otherwise.
good,"When its busy, your busy, The most hours I have ever worked in a two week period was at this job, 227 hours in a 2 week pay period. Extreme adverse weather conditions range from 115 degrees to minus 65 degrees. Not for the faint of heart. But I loved it."
good,"Have worked here for 19 years and would continue my employment here if I could, if it wasn't for all of the layoffs with the oilfield doing so poorly."
good,"Good place to learn about the completion tools industry"
good,Offshore a lot. Don't expect to get to much time off. The vacation that you earn is only 1 week of vacation. But you will make a lot of money. More then people with a PHD if you have the experience for them to pay you top salary. But if you don't that is ok too. Cause you will still make more then most people you know. Save your money cause Uncle Sam is coming for you during tax season
good,I have seen a lot of turn over since working here.  Very unstable work environment
good,I would recommend working for Superior.. Warrior on the other hand not so much. I worked for Superior for years until the transferred our product line to Warrior. The management at Warrior is not the best.
good,Good place to gain knowledge on tools and equipment. Worked offshore for 10 years on 21/7 schedule. Co-workers were fun great guys. Management was not that bad. Hardest part of job was being gone from family. Learning was enjoyable and traveling.
good,"always busy(24 hr call), learned a lot there with guys willing to give you knowledge they learned over the years, ok management needs work, co-worker are great, hardest part working with a person not willing to work are help out, off days are the most enjoyable days"
good,"Very stressful people in the Corp office, 3 reorganizations in less than a year"
good,"Big company but not a lot of communication, management need sum work but but provide me work and also keep me working. They took over backyard and been rough so far."
good,"The division that I worked in was severely under staffed and had very limited, if non-existent resources. This was an issue prior to the downturn in O&G and was compounded further by the drop-in oil prices. It is possible to be successful at the company but you must be a self-motivator, can hit the ground running, and expect zero resources or direction from upper management."
good,"Good pay, Good training and duties were much the same as any lift boat. Chipping painting. General maintenance of equipment. Oil changes on 5 engines. Standing watches while underway, checking of engine rooms frequently."
good,"typical day of work was a 12 hour shift"
good,"I liked the people, and had a good manager.  The company took care of me.  However I outsold what the group could provide, and it was affecting my reputation so I left."
good,"Bom dia a todos"
good,"Performed day- day administrative tasks, including maintaining information files and processing paperwork. Enter job information accurately and rapidly as work was performed on off shore wells. Underwent training and became proficient in Lotus Data Entry program. Provided administrative/ secretarial support for various departments."
good,Very rewarding experience including exposure to a wide variety of business subsidiaries and international operations. The rapid company growth through acquisitions provided ongoing opportunities to demonstrate and grow all of the key HR behavioral competencies from leadership to global & cultural effectiveness.
good,The hardest part was adjusting to a on call schedule system.  I had very little time with my family always working.  The most rewarding part was to see my progression into becoming a professional in the oil and gas industry.
good,"Typical day at work consists of loading jobs with special tools as per customer requests. Loading and unloading trucks with use of forklift. Directing individuals as needed, pressure testing equipment and working with management to successfully complete all job tasks at hand."
good,I was hired as a senior account representative to handle their downhole drilling tools division. It was well supported and management allowed for time focused on clients.
good,"Each day was different at Superior depending on if we were offshore or not. It was very difficult balancing my personal life and work due to being on the water for multiple weeks at a time, but we were compensated well."
good,While working for Superior I felt like I was part of a team.  Management took good care of the employees.  They put family first.  You were recognized for doing a good job.
good,"taught people well. good coordination. plenty of opportunity but, not very much time at home. was always kept pretty busy."
good,Ótima estrutura e boa didática de aprendizado e suporte para o funcionário.
good,"Nice place to work, but the management is not the best, i learn a lot with the company but lack of training is typical in this company, you have to learn yourself"
good,"I learned how to drive forklifts, overhead crane and learned about safety. It was a really good experience working there. I’d gladly recommend working there."
good,"Good company and lots of opportunity for your career buildup.fantastic management and good environment for your job. Facility is very good, also good salary."
good,"Good company for which to work. The hours are long, but the pay is great. The companies that are clients are among the best. Career opportunities are very good."
good,"I really enjoyed working here, but then management changed as did the atmosphere.  I still enjoyed working there, but then the layoffs happened.  Good people were let go and the less than stellar remained."
good,great place to work management truly cares for the employee
good,good company and good people. I have good experience for eorking in this company. the people here have good teamwork. they are always help each others.
good,"Empresa de médio porte, onde o contato com os diversos níveis hierárquicos é bastante constante e agradável."
good,"I was recruited by this company.  I could not accept position due to my wife being pregnant at the time.  Several months later after the birth of our daughter, they contacted me and follow through with promise of job.  Great boss, great benefits.  Left job to be employed by oil company."
good,The most professional company I have ever worked for. The management recognizes key employees and does all things necessary to promote advancement within the company.
good,Job requires you to be self motivated in order to take care of your work and have potential for advancement.  Company could do better at providing advancement opportunities for current employees rather than new hires.  Surrounded by coworkers with a lot of experience.
good,I only left the company because they sold our division. I would have stayed there until retirement had it been an option.
good,"Management sucks. But other than that everything is good, and you work a lot hours, so be looking to get weekends off. Or early days. Pays well and teaches you a lot"
good,Great place to wrk. Not to far of a drive. Never any traffic. Work all the overtime you want when it's available. Listen to music all day.  Is this place perfit... no... can they improve... of course...
good,I was hired in 2006 and worked til May 2014. Got laid off because of the drop in crude oil. I really enjoyed my time at Superior. We had good bosses and supervisors. The pay was good also. I would likely go back if asked.
good,"Company provided successful platform to Call on major, independent Sr executives, including Sr level engineers, Sr procurement and CEO/COO's, with a strong track record of success. Excellent opportunity to work with some of the most talented people in the O&G industry. Enjoyed growing and transitioning the company to new markets. "
good,This is a very strong company. the only reason I left was because of the merger with Complete and there way of management to many pay cuts on your performance. Hard to swallow.
good,The years that I worked for superior they were the best I got to learn about leadership I made supervisor they took a chance on me and in return I gave them dedication and all my strength to keep moving forward I was upset when they sold to manors but I kept my dedication to keep learning and to keep working hard.
good,"the company in a whole is a very good company to be a part of, unfortunelty they have recently been trying to change up management in the west texas division and has brought down the moral of the employees.  i enjoy the work, and for the most part all of the co-workers are great people."
good,Very good place to work people are easy to get along with and are willing to help and train you with anything you need.Have good benefits and are open about decisions being made that mite involve or affect you. They supply you with all resources needed to do your job.
good,Working with this company has showed me the ups and downs of the oil industry but they do try their hardest to keep you moving and paid without layoff applications
good,"A good place to work when they're organized, management always seems to butt heads from on department to the other. Poor dispatching, technicians are always crossing paths."
good,"Superior Energy Services is great to their workers with great benefits. You're not just a number here, I feel that your part of a big family! I haven't come across a person I didn't like."
good,Excellent supervisory. Is very knowledgeable and shares this with his team so they can be successful. The hours were long but was compensated fairly with the flexibility of weekly attendance.
good,A wonderful company that believes in their employees and was always willing to help and make your dreams come true. Very professional and safety orientated. Will train and teach you everything you need to know.
good,"Superior Energy is ranked at the top of the best places I have ever worked.  The management and staff are professional, friendly and caring.  My experience here has been extremely positive.  I highly recommend Superior Energy to candidates searching for employment."

good,love the job offshore love my coworkers my typical day consest of waking up going to rig up on the well running wireline and then going in for the night
good,There is room to grow. The job was great until the Oil & Gas industry took a hit. Friendly people to work with. You also have time to spend with family.
good,"This Job was my favorite job till this day. The company provided us with new single cab heavy duty trucks and they supplied 100% tools and also provided a cell phone to communicate with company employees. Every day you had a different location to work at from the DFW area to Stephenville ,Marshal tx, Houston ,Alice, Midland tx, El Reno,Tulsa Oklahoma etc. We would also due our training in Houston Tx (PPE) it felt like a mini vacation cause we would stay out there for a whole week and go to our safety and driving classes during the day as they would provide us with Hotel rooms and meals. I felt happy at the time cause they really took care of there employees. I felt like management was a new face every 6 months but we were always on the road and leads led the way. I enjoyed being out in the field and also doing some training my last year for the company."
good,Enjoyed my time working at Superior before the division was shut down during the 2016 Oil downturn.  Great group of guys with tons of experience. Enjoyed coming into work daily.
good,"I do not want to review this company.  I have not worked there for over two years and have nothing to say about them, the manager I had was good, but raises were VERY hard to come by and advancement was practically non-existent in the Broussard Location."
good,Worked with a great Project Team over the course of the 5 Plus years on the project. Excellent office location for all. Was a team effort put forth by all working on the project

good,"on call24/7,alot of driving from job site to job side,a great learning experience with high standards towards safety.the hardest part of job was no scheduled days off pretty going constantly putting in80 to 90 hours weekly,really enjoyed working with a lot of different companies doing different job every couple days not stuck in any routine"
good,I worked at Superior for only 6 months due to another position opening up I was trying for. They treated me great and working for them was awesome. Would do it again.
good,Working at superior was a great job. In the sales part of the company; if you wanted to make more money you got out and talked to more companies. I would also recommend people to look into this company if they want a great opportunity

good,I really enjoyed working @ Superior Energy Services but then the layoffs happened & then management changed good people were let go. I worked at Superior for 7 years they treated me great and working for them was awesome. Would do it again.
good,I was lucky to have a supervisor that cared and lead me instead of told me. Long hours would start in early mornings like 2-4am and be gone for days before coming home.
good,Hard work non stop on your feet for 12 hours or more a day. Cold Winters and Hot summers. When the Oil crisis took a turn it was rough. Awaiting the arrival of better bonus structures and high pay.

good,"As with Superior Energy - Superior Pressure Control is the sister company. I loved this job as well. Very laid back, No stress, got to wear jeans. I had no complaints with this position either. Hardest part was the company shutting down. When we shut down I cried for 2 months. I enjoyed my job and what I did."

good,"A Company of great opportunities. Despite the economic, social and political environment influenced directly the operations and business of the Company, the General Manager had a scope of futuristic vision and managed every situation in the right manner for both, the company and employees.

Superior Energy Services takes very good care of there employees. They have excellent benefits.
