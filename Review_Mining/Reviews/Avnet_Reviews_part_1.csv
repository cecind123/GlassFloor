rating,review
bad,Too stressful and not enough recognition  not enough pay either bossed aren’t reliable and are very picky and choosey on who they like. I wouldn’t do it again
bad,"Bad record keeping"
bad,"Overall not a good place to work, was hired on as a contractor with the promise that I would be hired within 60 days, after exceeding in all areas and learning the job of 3 different people I was still under appreciated and underpaid without any acknowledgement of my outstanding work ethic, I would never work at or with Avnet again"
bad,"When you got to work with a good account manager, things were really fun and we got a lot accomplished.  When you had a poor account manager to work with, things were absolutely miserable."
bad,Company paid poorly.  Company is struggling and not growing.  Employees are being laid off all the time.  Keep changing sales plans to avoid paying the account reps.
bad,Extremely lax when it comes to applying their own guidelines. Very  poor Roles assignment and delegation. I am not happy being forced to write this review.
bad,"If you desire to work for a company with morals and a clear path to grow your skill set, do not apply. Seek employment elsewhere. Management is selfish and does nothing to help you grow. I was there for over 10 years and only received one raise. Once you are hired you will not get a pay upgrade no matter how hard you work. The typical response is ""be lucky you have a job""."
bad,"before Tech Data buy out , very hard place to work, not a happy place, lots of people left as did I. things are bound to be different now that it has been sold to Tech Data"
bad,Avnet was a great place to work. The people made it a great place to work. Blah blah blah. I really don't have much to say about the company. They rarely bring up people to the next level.
bad,This was my first job I took as an early graduate of high school and I got fired because they didn't want to give me the day off to walk with my graduating class which is ridiculous and that was very important to me and my family so I took it upon myself and still took the day off.
bad,"Verbal harassment fueled environment, very difficult workplace.  They have managers managing spouses and relatives, making for favoritism and unfair practices."
bad,"Looks and sounds like a great company on the surface, but try working there. Management is a ""good old boy"" network, and your prospects for advancement are slim and none unless you're part of their network. Salaries are also much lower than industry average, and benefits are mediocre."
bad,"I worked at avnet for acouple of monthes,and there were many problems from the start. Firstly most workers were ilegal Vietnamese workers . I was born in the USA and was teased and poorly treated by the forign workers. They made fun of my race and my citizenship status. Being an american citizen they tried to be nice with me at first, tried to ""set me up"" with one of their daughters so she could geta green card.when I refused they Turned outright Hostile to me. They Made everyone stand the whole day without breaks, and when my joints hurt they did not care at all. I later found out that this was against OSHA policy . They should be grateful that I am not suing.  I have never complained when I was working there since I just wanted a paycheck. However My Lead refused to give me the 2 mandatory breaks required by california law. Also the Boss did not care at ALL when I told Him. Later the other workers said stuff behind my back regarding my race and I could not take it anymore. I complained to my boss and They Fired me. They told me that Since  my lead was more effective and had seniority , They were firing me. I have moved on but wanted to write this to warn others."
bad,Avnet bought out Nexicore Services promising to grow us from $50 million a year in revenue to over $500 million a year in 5 years and all they did was lay off 90% of the workers in a year and a half. Too strict and inflexible when it comes to needing time off. I've worked for Nexicore since 2005 and since Avnet took over it just became a worse and worse place to work for. They promised all sorts of perks that normal Avnet employees received and we never received any of them.
bad,"Current Chicago management staff know they’re in over their heads and should be demoted back to their account manager roles or better suited in different industry-better get your resume into Walmart today. Everyone knows this place requires a swift upgrade. Remove non-existent District manager, ineffective TSM, immature ISR manager.  Replace with experienced managers that have the guts, stamina and skills to create synergy, missing for a long time."
bad,this is a huge multi-billion dollar company that received huge tax breaks from the city of Groveport after promising to bring jobs to their new facility only to lay off about 50 people shortly after the place was built
bad,After the conversion to SAP April 2016 it's a MESS! At one time it was a very good company to work for. Not now. After the conversion to SAP all the rolls and processes and procedures are a mess. Everyone is in a CYA mode. Layoffs all the time. VIP's left. Don't even think about it.
bad,"A typical 8 to 5 work culture."
bad,This is a typical warehouse job. The work is simple but the conditions are not great. Like most warehouses it is not heated in the winter and does not have A/C in the summer. The work is monotonous and can be done by most anyone who can use 10 key.
bad,"No job security for technician. If you wanted to found a company ran by poor management Avnet is that company. In Columbus, Ohio we had managers who were only concerned about quantity not quality. Therefore we ended up losing business and technician lost their jobs due to a large number of scrapping."
bad,"Even though I worked very hard, I was let go for a ridiculous reason. There is no job security and management was awful. The workplace was extremely stressful."
bad,"- Einbuchen der Ware mittels Scanner und eines speziellen Buchungsprogrammes "
bad,In the last year many positions were sent to Mexico. Management was constantly changing.  There is no job security layoffs are happening often. The culture in the las year has taken a turn for the worse.
bad,"Unlimited time off is a joke, company is so short staffed getting any time off is almost impossible.  There is little advancement opportunity and pay is poor.  Very difficult to give good service to customers because of limited resources and poor erp."
bad,Very much a stab in the back atmosphere. Management looks out for themselves and no loyalty to employees at all! Would never recommend. Cut throat company.
bad,I was promised to get a decent amount of hours at Avnet but instead got a pitiful amount and then was laid off when work started to die out... Pay was nice... But I wasn't preforming the work I was told I was assigned to either. Instead of assembling computers I was shipping product... Horrible Experience.
bad,Stressful environment with a management team that does not care about employes.
bad,This is the worst company to work for. I would not recommend this company to nobody
bad,"You get what you pay for. They pay is very low and those are the type of people you work with. They manager would come to we asking questions, she didn't know how to handle her employees."
bad,"awful management, couldn't wait to find a new job, so happy I left.  Very depressing place to work.  Still do not understand fully what Avnet does.  Find something else!"
bad,"I'm a nice, thoughtful, and considerate person to my fellow man. But kindness isn't allowed while working at this place. These people were standoff-ish, arrogant, unhelpful, and downright pricks. Sure; read through all of the glowing reviews(From current employees that did'nt get canned because they were'nt liked.)"
bad,"After several tries to redefine and re-brand my division, they finally gave up and closed the whole division.   That was not foolish.  We did not know who were were, what our value was, or what our market was."
bad,"Tiene muchas deficiencias ya que su mantenimientos son correctivos, y las máquinas son con un software muy viejo, por ello se apagaban las maquinas y la producción no salía."
bad,"it is good company but also they need to improve in the system such as documentation , quality system and the procedure. Also the process is need to review before release to production floor."
bad,Long hours and very long weeks.  Very little amount of English spoken and lot of Spanish spoken.  It is hard to work with people when you don't know what they are saying.
bad,"Bon esprit"
bad,Avnet has bought a lot of companies over the past several  years and has done a very poor job of integrating them into one.   The hardest part of my job is the lack of communication from management.  I rarely know what my expectations are from day to day.
bad,"The job itself was great, but did not appreciate the blatant nepotism."
bad,"Used to be a great company. New CEO and leadership has really changed everything for the worse. Sold part of business, constant lay offs, moral is terrible, management is more focused and concerned about keeping their own jobs to the point of neglecting the people reporting to them. Work load is tremendous for the few people doing the work. Work / Life balance is preached, yet night and weekend work is mandatory."
bad,"Avnet has changed considerably since I left the company, with the CEO stepping down and the company divesting one major division after a major ERP rollout in the other major division."
bad,"Lots of underhanded occurrences happening.  Management proves to be very deceptive and unfair in their dealings.  I was forced to work for one year under a highly bias supervisor/manager and although I went to management, nothing but excuses were given on each occasion."
bad,Avnet has grown and matured in a very mature market in North America.  A global organization but focus has moved to Mexico for staffing and sales focus in Asia.  Unless you are willing to relocate to either region there is no longer career advancement.
bad,AVNet has a hard time selling services.  They don't sell software and the services is an important component of software sales
bad,"Huge, complicated operation, too many managers, too many masters."
bad,constantly breathing down your neck to work faster and faster and constantly increasing quotas beyond reasonable levels. would not give you any days off for vacation or time to go to the doctor if you were sick would not accept any doctor's excuses to miss work.
bad,"I was an extremely hard worker that was highly unappreciated, Management was horrible. I was underpaid for the amount of skills and dedication I had for the company."
bad,"Favoritism and Lack of Career Advancement - worked for years, no chance to grow.  Management was never able to determine exactly what the goals were. Execution was very poor. If you were young and attractive, you get bigger chance for career advancement even with less experience and skill set."
bad,"Fairly low stress job. Fellow employees are nice and helpful. Don't feel pressured to work long hours."
bad,Avnet used to be a really good place to work then they went and fired all the good managers did a software system upgrade there was a disaster and can't seem to find their place in the market. All of the new management with the exception of a few hardcore and don't really understand the industry or the company.
bad,"Pontos positivos: localidade, benefícios e trabalho home office"
bad,"First of all, it's very difficult to get hired on from temporary position.  The management team uses their temporary employees only when there is work for them to do.  You may work 7  days a week for three weeks straight and then be told not to come back in for two or weeks after that.  There's a lot of long hours working standing on your feet.  The pay is very low for the duties they require you to perform."
bad,"Bad environment bad management, no advancement, medical benefit is not good, I had to pay more out of my pocket."
bad,"NO job security, poor pay for technical work required. Only good things were direct manager was knowledgeable and nice. Upper ""big wig"" management however had no idea what they were doing. Pay was terrible for the required technical expertise. Also there were no benefits at all, which honestly within the tech industry is becoming a big problem all around in central ohio."
bad,"I did not enjoy working here. Micromanagement, and would not be recommended. ""Instead of truly assessing the shortfall of upper management they are creating a skeleton crew on the floor."
bad,I'm leaving Avnet that is now Tech data. the reason is there is too much favortism going around and very poor management.each dept. Has a different managers. seniority means nothing. I can go on but I'm not. I'm not happy their any longer and want to move on.
bad,não tinha um ambiente legal de trabalho o gerente não sabia lidar com pessoas. e também não havia oportunidade de crescimento.
bad,"You will work with experienced people, with high patience and understanding.  There is a very friendly atmosphere, even with the managers ad executives."
bad,I didn't get to learn to much I got hired as a temp and got laid off after three months. This was only a seasonal position wish I would have got to say longer.
bad,"experiencia boa na minha vida profissional,aprendi muito"
bad,"not a stable job, lacks communication skills. i learned how to process orders and shipping and recieving there thats about it"
bad,"In the 2 years I worked there, I never met my boss. big bosses like to come from out of state to try and micro manage  your area of work."
bad,"none at this time.  I don't have much to say, co-workers in company are great, but not in my department.  I enjoyed helping people.  Some managers and co-workers are on their own track instead of the company's goals.  "
bad,"coming out of the military as a grunt, i changed careers and became a tech at avnet, worked for them for 6 years, work was always repetitive , hardly any recognition, always expect to go above and beyond for nothing. Some people love it there but I have come to believe they do so cause of how much brown nosing is done to stay there. Management is very poor and the people they choose for promotions are even worse. The performance scale is absurd and the mandatory weekends when they have them. when they were really busy you could expect to work all month with no days off even if you had vacation saved up. as far as what i learned? well i learned that Avnet is a horrible place to work for, out side of skills i gained nothing from them except that even if you go error free externally from QAing everyones systems you get no recognition from it what so ever. My most enjoyable part of the job was leaving at the end of the day. I wish i had something decent to say about Avnet but the fact is I dont. the severance package was horrible, Getting unemployment is near impossible until after you have recieved your Severance and pension checks. so you can expect to go about 3-6 months before you can even receive UI benefits at least in Arizona."
bad,No personal touch to Avnet. Relationships with accounts are based solely on linecard and finance.......building relationships are secondary. Culture is VERY static and rigid...........you are nothing more than an employee number. Management constantly shifting focus from one quarter to the next and goals were basically unattainable. Very inflexible when it comes to customer service. Way too many layers of management and red tape which means that no decision is made swiftly.
bad,"This company enjoys an unusually large number of 10+ year employees. This is not a company that promotes from within unless you know someone. The pay is decent, better if you're coming in from outside though."
bad,"Fast paced, intense, competitive, very busy but gratifying helping customers and booking business. New CEO has taken a new direction for the company and since his tenure we have lost  traditional business, large and small customers. Three layoff's in the past 10 months have hobbled our ability to do business and maintain customer service due to lack of manpower which cause delays answering customers, supplier and our own team. Top inside and outside sales people have resigned to do the lack of direction, new pay structure and barriers now in place that prevents us from doing our jobs properly. Company used to be employee oriented and like a family. That is no longer the case."
bad,"Stressful work environment,"
bad,"Avnet operates with a bare bones staff, everyone is overworked and always worried that today will be their last day. Direct management is nice but will not defend you job."
bad,"Learned a lot about the channel and how it all fits together through the sales cycle"
bad,"Avnet is a good company for entry level job. It gives some good basic training that is useful but it needs to be complement from your own personal time. It has a good internal communication. Management seems to listen advices but slow to implement in the process due to bureaucracy. Employees I met personally, are friendly and have good deed to work hard to help you if need. However the more experience you have, the more difficult is to find opportunity in the internal process to advance in your professional career."
bad,"Typical day includes coming in at 9 and testing/auditing computer equipment and parts. I learned a lot about servers. The management definitely could have been better, as they choose their personal favorites instead of promoting people who can actually do the job. The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with SROs(sales return orders) The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with."
bad,management not involving employees in a decision. It was very hard to get advancement with in the company.
bad,"Company has made quarterly re-org and decided to maintain San Jose California's office as small as possible and started moving the most of positions to Mexico. "
bad,"Overall not a bad place to work. They do micro-manage. The management level is very high. They need more inside people to even out the workload. They are always training on new data bases."
bad,"The management organization had no sense of direction, interest in developing the business through employee development or other support essential to performing effectively. "
bad,"I worked at Avnet for 10 years.During that time I learned what it took to work for a large global company.The overall business was very segmented which made it extremely difficult  for customer and suppliers to engage with Avnet. Senior management recognized this flaw and is attempting to stream line the organization. They sold off one of the division to the competition and continue to try and re-invent the Avnet brand. But there recent conversion to SAP operating system was not successful as the design they chose was not compatible for their integrated solutions business."
bad,"Good opportunities for learning.  Large projects with a very intelligent community of employees.  If your thin skinned, you might want to consider whether this would be the right company.  Managers seem to be hard on you and the company culture is challenging.  The company offers a nice environment and some groups can be fun though."
bad,"For the position I was working in, a barrage of horrible functional flaws in the general workflow made this a very regrettable atmosphere for me, and others I worked with. Flaws that affect a work salary (rate pay) are nothing anybody wants to hear."
bad,Not much room for advancement.  Company is shrinking its US operations and expanding its Mexico office.  Company lacks innovation.  Doesn't offer telecommuting.
bad,"Shortage of resources and multi-tasking of playing different roles from the sales administration, order management and the team outsourced from Australia. "
bad,"i enjoyed working with the ladies on my team, management was rarely around as they had meeting almost everyday. i would not recommend this company to any of my friends."
bad,"Avnet is a large company and at corporate headquarters, many of the operations are conceptual only."
bad,"Always busy, good learning experience. Management lacked communication, few co-workers seemed distracted or off task. Hardest part of the day, being told there's no work for you after a four hour shift, or not being called in for two weeks if not longer. Most enjoyable part, learning and handling of server hardware/software workings."
bad,"In our job functions, there really aren't any 'typical days'. Each day is fraught with wins, challenges, fire drills etc. The role calls upon: Conflict management, astute data driven decision making, perseverance, tenacity, excellent communication skills, problem solving but most of all the relentless drive for results."
bad,"Work is very efficient, the people that work here are great. There is a very nice work to life balance within the company allowing PTO when  needed. Managers are money hungry."
bad,Good work place with average compensation. Growth for technical folks is very limited.
bad,"You should just keep busy, if its slow. Find something to do, cleaning is always helpful. Stay focused and always learning. Some people will offer help, but not all."
bad,Not happy with work environment overall everything is good. Area is good. Not recommend to join in summer as  weather is too hot. Client is ok you can learned a lot
bad,"Immediate Supervisor had great management skills & was flexible. My Manager was the polar opposite. Was constantly being pressed to take on multiple high priority issues, when others were available to help. Was very underappreciated by my manager."
bad,"Contract manufacturing is a very fast paced, mutli tasked envirroment. The employess became family after working with them for 16 years. It promoted team work, 5S methods and lean manufacturing."
bad,"Lots of Management Layers"
bad,"Heel zware dozen tillen."
bad,"Sold about half of its company, so it is downsizing. I only work in the AR dept. Don't like the fact that our credit dept. is in another state so communication isn't as accurate as it should be."
bad,Empresa boa para trabalhar e desenvolver o potencial profissional.
bad,"This location was once independent and was a very good company to work for at the time. Then it was acquired by Avnet, which brought on numerous layoffs, and changes to the overall work environment that were not positive, including many cost-cutting measures that reduced morale."
bad,The project I was hired for was planned very poorly. Ultimately I could not be provided enough work to justify my employment and was laid off after leaving another job.
good,The company didn't need my services anymore. There were slow so I got laid off. This was a short term job position. It was okay while it lasted but that was it.
good,Great people to work with. Everyone comes to work each day to do their best. Avnet being a 95 year old company will need to adapt to the some of the new ways to do business if they are going to be able to retain top talent. The best part of the job is utilizing the team to overcome obstacles to win a new customer. On board the customer and move them into sustaining production.
good,Temporary job first day they tell you to look for something different that this job is not going to last management is horrible training is subpar most of what you learn is OJT. Weird hours stuck in a weird environment in a cage wher e you are forced to reimage laptops and other shipping. They don't give you the needed tools and end up blaming you for their failures.
good,I have worked in my field for 30 years. I spent a year at Avnet in Groveport. I have never seen such a out of control managed place. No value for the hourly worker. When money is low (not the economy) heads will role.
good,"Como minha gerencia não tinha postura de gerencia, tudo se tornava muito dificil no local."
good,Empresa a boa de trabalhar Supervisão ótima colegasde trabalho unido Traballhar o sábado até 22:35hs deveria ter um horário no sábado mais flexível.
good,"Avnet absorbed the company that I worked for (Nexicore) and within a year, closed all support contracts, closed the locations doors, and laid off almost all employees that didn't take the move to the Ohio location (from a Florida site)."
good,"Busy from start of my day to finish"
good,Je wordt ingewerkt op harde schijven in the boeken.
good,"After a short period of time, Avnet left the country leaving an entire staff jobless.  Several were given relocation packages but they moved to Mexico."
good,"Started with Avnet to get hands on experience in the IT field and was promised advancement of training through the company."
good,"Extensive hours although I found that to be fitting although many of my co-worker did not find this fitting. It took my friend 2 and a half years to get hired on full time. You were not able to tell them you couldn't stay late, but if work was slow they would send you home so your pay checks were very unbalanced."
good,Good place to start a career because of the Avnet brand and what it means within the industry. The pay could be better as well as the benefits.  Worked with some great people.
good,"Too many ups & down; "
good,"work at home options and flexible work life balance , you could work two days from home.- Good Benefits one of the few companies that still offer a company pension. Poor Management"
good,"This company, I felt, was poorly managed.  There are several issues with the latest ERP systems making work very manual and stressful. No real advancement opportunities or fair pay increases.  No bonuses."
good,The past couple of years were challenging due to a change in our data entry tool.  Company disengaged with many top customers due to our limitations to provide top on time delivery.
good,A typical day at Avnet for general warehouse workers includes packing and shipping. This can range from small items to orders that become palletized. The work does become heavy quite often though and some areas are not compensated for the lack of workers in that certain department.
good,Great place to get some solid experience and meet great people.  Not a lot of advancement opportunity.  They have layoff's several times a year that get stressful.
good,"Very focused in Senior Management, ignoring the little people's needs or well-being. Old boys club mentality, promotion among buddies and nepotism. Useless HR department which never sided with the employee and did not fix any abusive situations within the departments. No value given to any employee since they were firing people left and right for no reason, just to save some bucks to keep buying lot of companies that in the end forced them to sell one of their businesses to a competitor."
good,"After being employed at this company for almost a decade. I can honestly say that I really haven't learned any valuable life skills, management skills that I can classify as a transferable skill. Mgmt. never really wanted to listen to my brilliant ideas to promote better teamwork and improve quality issues. Management expects you to meet unreachable productivity levels. Corporate America!"
good,"Personal equations are more important than performance"
good,"close department very easy. inventory staff salary is very low. bad management, poor benefit. It is a not good experience to work in this company."
good,"Avnet was a good experience, a typical day of work consisted of answering phones, filing documents and answering emails."
good,"No advancement, Wage increase frozen"
good,It is hard to put into words when a company is bought out by another and dwendles its employee down to nothing.  At this time I have comment.
good,"This was a temporary job scanning records for the company. They were good to me, but had a lot of non English speaking workers using blueprint written in English."
good,Get to learn different scope of work comparing to practicing life in Legal Firms advising business teams and Management and all legal contracts and issues. Working culture is good with good team members.
good,"En esta empresa es dificil de moverse de puesto ya que rara vez publican las vacantes disponibles al personal, publicandolas al publico casi de manera secreta."
good,"Avnet as a whole is a good company."
good,"The company was healthy when I started in 2004 but over the years it has cut employees, entire departments, benefits (vacation, sick time, health insurance, pension, etc.) It is losing market share and customers to competitors. I do not trust the current CEO. Workplace morale is currently very low. Employees do not trust management."
good,"8:30 to 5pm Monday to Friday, Office based, 1 hr lunch breaks, Good mix of staff. 25 days holiday, I liked working at the company because it was local the team I was with."
good,Avnet is a good place to work.  It is an established company with good processes in place.  This is a demanding company that needs to get their Technology updated an in place so employees can do their job effectively.
good,Going through a difficult time with a system issue.   This cause a lot of stress.. Upper management is disconnect from the real world.    Going to redo the system
good,"The management communication was lacking. Most of the time one needed to search the company intranet for information. Additionally, the company went through 7 RIFs within a 2 year period."
good,"There was a large lay-off of an entire wing of the warehouse when I started. There was little to no training and I was forced to work through their temp agency which was a joke. I honestly wasn't sure of my pay rate until I got my first check. The job itself wasn't bad though. I wan't micromanaged and got to work at my own pace, but was in competition with several others for one open full time position."
good,Some deceitful practices when generating sales reports to suppliers which was encouraged to do by middle and upper management.    Overall a fun position but the half-truths can wear on you over time
good,"Uma empresa boa, aprendi muitas coisas em relação operacional, a equipe de trabalho todos muitos prestativos e esnsinavam super bem, a parte dificil era na questão de metas que algumas vezes faltava componentes para conseguir cumprir a meta estabelecida, o clima de trabalho era agradavel"
good,"A good Place to start if you have never worked in AP and  need to learn skills."
good,Not a good place to hold a stable job. No more for advancement.  Everyone below management was great to work with. Appreciation lunch was provided often.
good,Veel buiten bij klanten mits dit door planning goed wordt georganiseerd
good,"Aggiornamenti continui riguardo l'attività lavorativa."
good,You will be really busy working at this company. There has been a lot of lay offs over the last few years. That means more extreme workloads on employees
good,"Avnet has changed a lot since I last worked there. Cost constraints and reorganizations lead to many talented people leaving IT in Avnet. Therefore I am not sure about its work culture and IT environment. I believe the overall organization still makes management decisions based on conservative principles and communicates top management goals well. The key is always middle management, if you have a professional and caring middle manager, you can deal with any shortcomings in the organization."
good,"-This is normal place to work"
good,Worked in a Division that was relocating  so the experience was not very appealing. I suppose that working at corporate offices would have made a difference.
good,Decent work place with limited advancement opportunities.  Good work/life balance.  Benefits are good.  Lot of recent changes and the management does not have any clue of what they are doing.
good,"Great manager who I still have a tremendous amount of respect for. But it was very hectic working there and vacations, sick days or holidays were rarely NOT interrupted by work related activities. Month/quarter/year end was a test in mental and physical endurance and were more often than not 15-20 hour work days. "
good,I learned a lot but not really a career kind of job just a place to gain experience. There was no room for growth and there was no job security we always had an issue with layoffs.
good,"Typical day 8 plus hours a day."
good,"Doordat vele aanwezige oplossingen van leveranciers aangeboden worden, concurreer je intern veel met de andere afdelingen. Zodra een project van start stuurt het management naar de oplossing waarmee een project 'gekocht' wordt. Weinig of geen overleg over hoe aan te pakken van projecten waarin meerdere afdelingen betrokken zijn. Oplossing is dan niet de oplossing waar de klant op zit te wachten."
good,"Very reactionary employer. Nothing is a problem until its a huge problem. There is no accepted responsibility for management mistakes, only passed down larger work loads. I found an issue in payroll with their ADP system auto-deducting from employees for meal periods even when the employee had time in/out punches. Two days later I was terminated for ""Performance issues"" even though I met and exceeded all metrics set forth by my manager, and had very good reviews."
good,"You work on various projects and are delegated various responsibilities.  "
good,I love my hours here just need more money. I like my hours and the people are nice here. JUST month end seems you never can take off even if you're sick.
good,"Be careful who you trust and always cover your rear. Employees may seem nice but will bus roll you the moment they are in the hot seat. Management knew less about what was going on and spent more time in meetings and not even being in the office to manage anyone. The benefits are top notch and some of the best around. It's the other things that bring this company down. A tech company behind in technology, managers and directors MIA all the time, and co-workers that will try to get you fired. If you are looking to get looked down upon and treated like a workhorse for the benefits, and to not have job security because they outsource jobs to other countries, then this is the place for you."
good,"This is a legacy company operating in the technology space, yet seems to be behind the times in its own culture and initiatives.  For such a big company it is tough to advance with the amount of politics.  The compensation is ridiculously low in comparison to many other companies I've compared Avnet with.  Other benefits are decent such as pension plan but no 401K matching option is anything but enjoyable."
good,"The atmosphere is good at Avnet Company. At the company, people are friendly there. A typical day at work is working together co-worker with the same goals get the job done."
good,"Good company, need to get the right boss to support your efforts as the learning options are abundant if you take advantage of the opportunity."
good,"Good people to work with, fulfilling tasks, only leaving because we are getting laid off."
good,"Responsable Division Marketing (Pôle Connectique) : "
good,"Buen ambiente laboral con un salario decente, pero no muchas prestaciones"
good,Got chance to work as dedicated FAE for Texas Instruments and Radiocraft and worked with Supplier and Customers in Various domains for the design In/Win of the Products.
good,"Still have contacts there, and seems like the company is just not the same.  I'm for sure they still have great people, but there was a mass exodus due to layoffs and people leaving.  "
good,Under market pay scale and humanly impossible amount of work to complete but enjoyed my time at Avnet. Co-workers were great and I liked my supervisors.
good,Up until 2016 Avnet was one of the primer fortune 1000 companies to work for. Since 2016 senior level management has become some what of a revolving door. This has caused a instability to down stream management and employees. Projects are not meeting deadlines and some are cancelled or on hold with no target dates of completion. It is very frustration for employee who have been at Avnet for long periods of time.
good,It was a great place to work. It is filled with good people. The only reason I left was the compensation was severely lacking compared to the millions in sales provided.
good,"decent place to work"
good,"6 years ago, Avnet appeared to be a company that wanted new faces that were eager to learn and grow as the company did. However, since the sale of their entire TS Division just a little over a year ago, there has been no opportunity for growth or promotion. There are many opportunities to cross train with other departments, and those departments are even willing to transfer the workload to individuals that do cross train. Unfortunately, compensation remains stagnant, and there is no incentive to cross train other than for personal growth. It is a wonderful place to get a foot in the door especially for entry level IT. At this point though, it seems that moving into a new role is just not an option, and could possibly take another 18 months before anything starts to advance again."
good,Good people just not enough benefits or pay to substain a family. They add field days once a year and are great with how they treat ypu. But advancment was low to none.
good,"This company has undergone too many changes too quickly.  They need to slow down and figure out what they want to do when they grow up.  They are VERY tactical, myopic, and lack strong vision and leadership.  Not a good environment."
good,Wonderful people poor management. Great place to work but could not find any career growth. Great place to start a career but no incentives to stay for any longer than needed.
good,"Avnet is one of the worlds largest distributor of electronic components."
good,"liked the people I worked with..."
good,Great group of people that work here. The biggest problem at Avnet is to many managers that know nothing about electronics and they try to tell you how to do your job.
good,"Provides and ensures accuracy and timeliness of part, price and availability information to sales team for customer quotations."
good,An interesting place to work with a more bigger workforce. A lot of opportunities to learn with wonderful co-workers. The hardest part is
good,"adorie poder fazer parte desse time, no qual aprendi muito."
good,"Typical day at work: go in, fill orders"
good,Good to place to work during good economic times. Tough during downturns as the expectations were not realistic. Most management have been there a long time and are really good people.
good,Acceptable corporate non personal environment. Salary is not impressive.  Great benefits. Managment is unprofessional.  Location was easily accessible
good,"The job is repetitive, you are just handling orders whether is counting the product or receiving the product in. Its got a cafe and free coffee but soul draining."
good,The leadership has changed since I left the company.  All the senior leaders are in new roles so my experiences probably do not reflect the current situation.
good,Looking to move to Florida and gro my career in the industry. I drove a forklift and a cherry-picker. Im interested in learning new things and im a very fast learner
good,Avnet is a good place to work. Lots of opportunity at different levels in various divisions. Good benefits including tuition reimbursement. Pension plan.
good,Fulfillment of component requests from the internal customer. I did not learn anything I did not already know from previous employments. I had no interaction with the Avnet Management other than my local manager. The internal culture for remote storeroom operations had no description since there were very few of this operational model at that time.
good,The work is very fast-phased since you are in production. It is very easy to do if you know your materials. But it can be really tiring since it is repetitive work. Overtime at Avnet is expected and also required.
good,I was a contract worker at Avent. The building I worked in was nice and management was very supportive. I would recommend working at this company if you have an opportunity.
good,"Avnet was a great place before the buy out.  It was more like working with family and good people at one time.  But once Tech Data took over, things started to go down hill from there."
good,Fast pace. Every step of the process is timed. From the time you log into a job the clock is ticking. They seem to hire a lot of contract help. there is a possibility of being hired on full time.
good,Fast pace sales organization. 
good,"Every day had its own challenges in warehousing and distribution, balancing workload and human resources to reach and meet daily goals, fulfilling orders was satisfying, teaching and mentoring even better. The hardest were the long hours needed to implement change but satisfying seeing it work and function at the end, hardest part was having to leave once implementation completed in and quest for new challenges and opportunities for improvements and future growth."
good,"Many employees have been with the company for 20+ years.  Lots of ""we've always done it this way"".  However, there is lots of room for advancement as the company is large and you have the opportunity to try new positions."
good,"Avnet has gone through a major re-branding since it's new CEO and divestiture of TS to Tech Data...  when they meant ""rebrand/refresh"" they weren't kidding.   Several rounds of reduction of employees, not only do the paint on the walls and the carpet on the floors look different, you won't notice any of the folks on the floor either."
good,Would rather hire interns than retain someone with extensive experience. only after the bottom line regardless of how it affects anyone else. Will not rehire even when qualified
good,Lots of sexually harassment going on everyday and the management new about it but did nothing about it. One girl was fired because she complained about it.
good,"Pros"
good,"the job was very enjoyable and relaxed the only issue was the work volume would go up and then down, so we weren't getting our hours which resulted in a layoff."
good,"It was fun and nice before the management team were change. There was not enough communication from the management. It was work-life balanced until the management had been changed. the hardest part of the job is that the managers don't know the system and not willing to learn plus play a lot of office politics."
good,"Reasonable expectation for job/life balance.  Slow in adopting some technology.  Likely due to organisation being too big.  Relationship though not warm was professional.  Getting help in areas which lies between 1 section and another, is challenge."
good,"It's been a long time since I worked here. I left over 16 years ago."
good,A typical day at work would always involve new challenges that allowed employees to learn and develop new skills. The work environment was friendly including working with management.
good,$16B Company with various electronic services .  Company has been in existence for many decades.  Its range of services range from components to integration solutions
good,"great place, very professional.a very good place to learn & build your experience. kind people willing and eager to train & teach you new experiences."
good,"Avnet is a ""good ole boys"" club, and in many ways a carry-over of old school company cultures. They are attempting to add new ways to drive employee engagement, and they also instituted a ""no-limit"" vacation policy. Basically, as long as performance goals are being met, and your manager approves, you receive unlimited vacation time. This is just one benefit they are now offering that many other valley employers have offered for years."
good,At the time one of the leading edge distributors and integrators of fiber optic technologies with top notch customers in research universities and major tech players
good,"Wish there was more stability"
good,Avnet was a good place to work for however they ended up taking over Nexicore and kept own employee. Managers and supervisors very professional
good,"It is an ever changing company with a fast paced culture."
good,"Work Hard, get rewards."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the diversity of my role, no 2 days were the same."
good,"Stellingen opgezet en printers, moederborden geordend d.m.v zelfgemaakte techniek op Excel."
good,"A typical day involves taking approvals for invoices, processing invoices, processing payments, uploading payments (EFT) on bank, reconciliations, processing staff expenses on Concur, conducting UAT testing for SAP, answering internal and external queries, analysis and reconciliations of corporate credit card etc. During inductions of other employees, I am required to conduct training to other employees on how to submit their staff expenses on Concur. Once in a while I have to train our counterpart finance team overseas on how to process Concur expenses."
good,"I said it's okay,after all it's better than doing nothing,but management is so unfair and long term employees are being treated badly,favor,promotion,salary,all based on whom they like,either by gender,race and personal favors,"
good,Cloud blue was great job overall i made some good money and had fun along the way meet some really cool people. I learned some great skills as well the job made me stronger physically and mentally the work enviorment was calm and pretty chill.The management was pretty supportive an made the work place more enjoyable and fun.
good,"•	Establish strong client relationships"
good,Salary and Benefits are Ok.Job Culture is Good.work ambiance is good.Team work is most enjoyable part. Good experience working with Avnet .
good,"mid level management is HORRIBLE, put personal/private agendas ahead of department goals, had many people fired to do so. very unprofessional situation"
good,"Recruitment"
good,"There is always something going on as far a positive and pleasant environment in one's work day. I learned many different things at this company. I learned so much in the technical sense, how the function of each programming machine was so complex. I couldn't say enough about the management, such as how well they, and their employees got along and showed each other so much respect. You could really tell how much the management of this company appreciated their workers. My co-workers of this company had nothing but good work ethics, respect, decency, and selflessness. The hardest part of my job was that I wished I had learned more."
good,"Working distribution offers natural obstacles as you are forced to negotiate for margin on both the supplier side and customer/sales side.  There is a constant struggle to be creative in an effort to drum up additional revenue, this often leads to changes in benefits and compensation packages, employee layoffs, and other methods of cost savings."
good,Dedicated long term team that worked hard to keep pace in a extremely tough and competitive market.
good,De la empresa no tengo que decir nada pero el ambiente laborar es muy pesado.
good,"Worked closely with centralized sales agents ordering components, providing pricing and availaiblity"
good,"Created a brand new division, hired great people, but management was so political with it's employees and  key accounts. The division was eventfully broke up and was dissolve."
good,Avnet ( Formerly known as Nexicore) bought Nexicore in December 2012 by March 2013 we had our first layoff and since then we have had 3 more. We had about 400 employess and are down to less than 20 with a few more of us going this month.
good,My job duties were device programming.  My co-workers are easy to get along.  The hardest part of the job was handling small parts.
good,Simi Valley facility was great while it was open. I was part of a great team that I will miss.
good,"great place to work "
good,"I enjoy that at my job I am able to work autonomously, but that assistance is available when needed.  The atmosphere is friendly and productive and I have some wonderful colleagues.  I have gained many valuable skills from this position and have drastically expanded my proficiency with Microsoft Excel and SAP software.  I have also gained further experience in customer relations and successfully lowered past due balances on many accounts during my employment."
good,"Now merged with Avnet Technology Solutions."
good,Organizied and work fast. Its receiving/ production so everything is timed on how fast and accurate you do your job.
good,"worked on putaway team,stocking shelves with electronics products,big distribution warehouse."
good,"Good culture.  The company is changing their Core business.  Lots of long term employees, 20+ years is about the average.  Good pension program and benefits including FTA for vacation."
good,"Good company, not a lot of opportunity to advance. Good benefits, a lot of meetings, layoffs come often. Tuition assistance, this is one of those companies to retore from.... No one leaves a place like this unless ur laid off"
good,Started out as a great place to work with great benefits and decent pay but poor business decisions have made the company loose customers and change management causing them to sell off 40% of the company resulting in many layoffs.
good,Take a lot of pride with my accomplishment in building world class software tools and led the logistics team on its ERP transformation effort. Established manufacturing Information Technology capabilities in North America and a valuable member and leader in onboarding new ERP solutions to North America and Europe.
good,"The team camaraderie is great and the boss is fun, but there is a constant need to put out fires, slow to implement changes, and currently not much opportunity for growth beyond the core requirements of our group."
good,"Really good coworkers. In many respects it was a very nice place to work. Management was usually supportive. But, with a declining market layoffs and reorgs were frequent. We had to learn what the code words were because changes were communicated in such a positive way that you couldn't always tell what they really meant. You never knew who your boss was going to be next or how long you might keep the current one. I saw a couple of positions created only to be eliminated several months later."
good,"El ambiente laboral generado por el Gerente General de la época, era muy tenso, competitivo, no favorecía el  trabajo en equipo."
good,"2002 lay-off eliminated our dept."
good,The biggest issue was a central conflict of interest between distribution vs. services.  Senior management lacked a true understanding of the software and professional services industry.
good,New management does not realize the complexity of the semiconductor industry.   The company has dropped from number 1 in key indicators to number 2 or 3.  They continue to lose supplier partners with key technologies.  These are not commodity products that can be easily replaced.
good,Worked at Avnet 34 years.  They have been going through many changes the past year causing lots of stress to the employees.  New computer system does not work properly to service the customers.  They are working to improve it.
good,Its a good job that does not change much. The management seems to be a little unorganized. Not willing to work out schedules for most people. Overall easy job.
good,"Learnt to focus on each and every small project  and never ingonre customer grievances if they have any."
good,"organizational changes "
good,"good benefits, low salaries, very good environment (people wise).Good use of systems and tools . You get to learn a lot."
good,"The good the team (co-workers) made the work environment a great place to be even with poor leadership in place. There are good chances for advancement in the lower tiers but once you hit mid level the opportunities quickly stagnate. "
good,"Excellent, wonderful people and place, good enjoyed the position and meeting the customers and partners I had to work with as well as working with a great team"
good,"Cuenta con un muy buen ambiente de trabajo, libertad para realizar actividades, con un trabajo a un ritmo favorable"
good,"For  large company, Avnet does a decent job focusing on employees, but struggled to adapt fast enough to changing market conditions. Ultimately, it's technology division was sold which was probably best for everyone."
good,"This company tries to be very family oriented.  Most departments can can work from home permanently and others at least a couple of days a week. Avent offers great benefits,"
good,"It's a great place to work for 25 yrs, Avnet is one of the 500 fortune  Company, I love this company when I was there, great people at the job site, during my time have a good managers."

good,"Empresa muito boa de se trabalhar a única coisa que deixava a desejar,"
good,"It' a great place to work: with flexible hours, safe environment, friendly employee and they're a team player."
good,"While I enjoyed the team that I worked with, even as it constantly changed, grew, and shrank, I was dissatisfied with management and the sheer amount of micro-managing that I experienced. When Avnet bought our company, and we integrated, it became even worse. Decisions were made on-high that would ultimately cause our department to close, while very little was done to fix the problem while it happened."
good,"I follow the customer assistance, sales of electronics components."
good,For the most part this a good place to work. Work can be repetitive. With the new location this company seems to be growing which can be a great thing.
good,i didnt really have a problem there. my coworkers were willing to help me when i needed help. the training was good. they gave me a nice tour of the factory. and the job was easy.
good,Diverse workplace. Inspection at QC area is tiring but at the same time love talking with people. The hardest part of the job is when there are expedite orders and we are rushing to ship it.
good,Empresa muito boa para trabalhar mas sem um plano de carreira bem estabelecido
good,"I loved working for Avnet for 5 years. Something happened, new CEO and changes started with no clear explaination and then the cuts started for downsizing. The stock dropped and well, I'm not sure what happened and after being gone for a year...I still don't know what happened, but the company continues to be challenged."
good,"Not a climate controlled environment, average job, I liked working repairing consumer electronics. Didn't like the fact that their decision/notice to close the facility was sudden."
good,Ever changing environment which can be invigorating for those of us who enjoy change.  Electronics industry as a whole going through some profit challenges like most mature industries do.
good,"I was hired as a contractor. I was a hard worker and constantly demonstrated a high value. My supervisors and those around me recognized my talents and eventually moved me up to be an engineer. After a year and a half I was still contracting and there was no end in sight. Finally some very bad business decisions were made and a lot of money was lost because of it. I got laid off because of this, despite having basically been a ""permanent contractor"" and it was obvious to those around me that they would hire me eventually. Long story short, if you can get a permanent position it's a good place to work. But it takes a lot of effort to get there for most people. In the meantime you have very little job security."
good,"Die Arbeit bei Avnet war rein körperlicher Natur, aber geistig war man nicht gefordert"
good,"- Great place to work"
good,This is a good company to work especially in bushiness field but not that much good for engineering. The environment is friendly and productive
good,I have been working at Avnet for almost 5 years and i have met amazing people working for this company. I enjoy working for this company they are very involved withthe community and i appreciate that. I would have to say that the hardest part of the day is waking up everymorning at 5 am to make it to work every saturday and sunday to work ten hour shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people who i know genuinely care about me.
good,"Avnet is one of the largest electronic distributors in the world.  It offers a fast-paced work environment and provides a full range of electronics component solutions and embedded computing products supported by a first class supply-chain and design-chain services portfolio.  Core values are integrity, customer service, accountability, teamwork and innovation."
good,"Company is very numbers based and driven for results. Very fast paced environment and as an employee you are expected to meet or exceed your numbers as an individual and as a team. Each department was responsible to meet or exceed their specific daily, weekly and monthly goals as the affected all other departments as a whole."
good,"I like work in IT field so always I try to develop myself"
good,ik heb er heel veel bijgeleerd zoals putaway en klaarmaken van bestellingen zoals reels tubes en weight. de sfeer met colegas was fijn en het was mijn tweede thuis. moeilijkheden heb ik er niet gekend en het leukste is dat ik van dat werk hield om te orderpicken

good,"Same stuff different day. Benefits are good, employees are great but management sucks. Overall company doesnt seem to care about the little guy. Very large company that cant translate macro company goals into micro team/individual goals."
good,"The Philippines office is quite small which is their strength. Everyone know each other and cares for each other. Everyday everyone eats each meals together and drinks coffee together. "
good,"Even though we had a record quarter, many of us were let go including an entire departtment. Even though they are hiring again, I won't reapply."
good,Was a good work environment. Unfortunately if your a contractor there are no oppurtunities once the project is complete to become a permanent employee. There are a lot of budget constraints when it comes to the IT dept with this company
good,"There are many job opportunities within Avnet with the possibility of job advancement depending on job performance. The daily tasks are interesting and challenging, yet obtainable to complete."
good,"Good culture and Ethics, Good Procedures, Diversity, Good Products and Customers, Global Operations. Challenged by the customers we served and enjoy the long lasting relationships"
good,"I was the site manager responsible for everything from opening up the location to closing up at the end of the work day,  Managed all resources personnel to capital equipment."
good,Working here has aloud me to learn lots of trades when it comes to a business. However now I feel like I'm stuck in my current area and can't further my career anymore in this company. I was quickly trained in multiple areas but now I cannot learn anything new.
good,"On a daily basis, i maintain my backlog, enter orders in our system (SAP) i get along well with my colleagues."
good,I enjoyed working at Avnet because I was given the opportunity to advance within the 7+ years that I worked there and the culture was very diverse which made it interesting. The hardest part of the job was that most of the time we were short staffed.
good,"Spent nearly 20 years with them only to be laid off due to budget cuts. In the beginning it was a great place to work, but the market has changed and become much more competitive."
good,"Avnet is a sophisticated employer, with an elaborate IT system in house. I was able to work extensively with VPN connections for Avnet people out in the field."
good,"You get the technology work experience you need at Avnet, just not the pay that other companies would pay you for a similar position.  It is a great place for jr. folk to learn the ropes and forge relationships you will leverage for the rest of your IT career, but unless you are part of the C-Suite you will not make at Avnet what you could elsewhere.  "
good,Avnet cares about it's people. Flexible time for me to work as long as I get the job done. benefits are good. Pay is better than average. Good comminication

good,"A typical day at work,"
good,A productive teamwork experience. Everyday was a new experience with processing the data given and learning new ways of getting the job done. The company would give you a chance to grow.
good,"I have been working here at the 47th St. Building in phoenix the whole time I have been here. Everyone's experience is different but for me this company has been relatively low stress, stable, and there is very little office politics. However this company has an old school environment, is not very progressive, and the mentality of management is about 30 years behind more progressive companies. It has been my experience that the management here lacks the competency, insight, and even interest in their employees to make a fair evaluation on job skills and contribution for determination of pay level and promotion consideration."
good,"Promotes within.  Good steady, routine work.  40 hour weeks with some overtime.  Learned a lot from this company.  The most enjoyable part of the job were great co-workers and team building management staff.  Everyone had a great outlook of working.  Everyone knows what is expected of them and everyone works together."
good,"Great workplace culture, depends on the management you get. The company heavy with upper management that doesn't engage lower level employees. Avnet is a great company that promotes work life balance and good compensation."
good,Good place to work.  Employee centric and great benefits.  Accountability culture.  Good corporate values. Company in flux with new CEO.  SAP conversion took a huge toll on customer credibility.
good,"Very cohesive team"
good,Great place to learn and grow. Most managers are engaged with their teams and want to have them succeed and have paths for them to do so. Was a good experience to work there in all the different departments I had been in.
good,"Similar to the EM side, Avnet's TS side was an enjoyable place to work that gave a great deal of information and education and allowed for a great team to work with."
good,Avnet was a good place to work and it provided plenty of education and resources to help me learn more in my field and expand my knowledge in other fields as well.
good,Avnet is very diverse on what type of business they do. There are many opportunities for an individual to learn different process and gain valuable experience.

good,"Avnet provided me with the ability to learn from working at multiple large companies on their IAM systems giving me a good look at how different companies manage their IAM needs.

good,I enjoyed my time working for Avnet twice.  Most of the  management team is very supportive of your efforts and fewer are open to new ideas and thoughts.  Many of the old regime has left so it is a new world order which avnet desperately needed

good,"It's good for what it is. If was smarter back then, then maybe I would've stayed. But since I wanted to go to school at that time, things got complicated. Overall it's not a terrible place to work at. They do pay you for overtime and they pay for your tuition. Not forget to mention they have nice benefits. If you like peace and quiet then it's a place for you. You just need to do some heavy lifting and put in some elbow grease."
good,"geen investering in de It security afdeleing"
good,Avnet offers many great career advancement opportunities for individuals willing to put in the time to seek them out.  Avnet management differs across organizations.  Some managers hold their sellers to strict requirements while others do not.  Working with other team members who do not understand urgency and results make it difficult internally to get tasks completed.
good,"A typical day at work was extremely busy. My immediate management was the best I've ever worked for.  They were supportive, encouraging and helpful at all times. The Avnet COE family was supportive and hard working.  The most enjoyable part of the job was my customers and sales/product teams."

There was no shortage of work, which sometimes meant long hours, not all paid as a contractor. However, I did really enjoy working with all the people on my teams. Lots of professional and friendly people in all aspects of the IT department."
good,"Not a bad place to work and could return to how it once was, but since switching to a newer SAP system, the workload and stress levels required have taken a sharp uptick."
good,"Great company that is invested in employees; in the midst of evolution that will be foundation for the next few decades.  Once implementations have been streamlined, Avnet will thrive."
good,"Spend most of your time in a cubicle and would usually have to get up to get a response from people, people aren't always staring at the SameChat window or Skype. Agents would sometimes become irate because of the limitations that has been put on Avnet by All State.

There are no perks like most modern day tech companies but overall its a secure job.

Als moeilijkste periodes moet ik toegeven is de ingewikkelde organisatie vorm, om hieraan uit te komen heb je minstens een jaar nodig, dus mijn begin periode was het erg goed uitzoeken.
