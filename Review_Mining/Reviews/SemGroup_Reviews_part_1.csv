bad,"well let's start, I lasted about three weeks then the bad thing started happening, no loads but the senior drivers had their loads and enough for a full day. Drivers coming in on their days off when loads were short and dispatch would load them and give new drivers the scraps. Sometimes they would not be any but one load left.... then dispatch would apologize for the unfortunate events and say it will get better and that they are complacent with the way things are...  Sorry, but saying things will get better doesn't pay the bills. "
bad,"This is a very poor place to work if you want any kind of a family life. It is an extremely stressful place to work with all the spying going on. There is absolutely no weekend or night shift support at all. If a person has the misfortune of breaking down on nights you almost have to beg to get a mechanic to come out to help. The field supervisors are off on weekends and nights. If they happen to answer the phone when you call them, their first response is to chew you out for calling and if there is a problem they'll have to look into it on Monday. If you go on vacation they demand you work through your vacation. My wife is so frustrated with my working here and the way they treat their employees. I highly recommend anyone who is considering going to work for this company needs to reconsider the options first."
bad,"Upper management at the Pearsall yard is nothing but a joke. The current area supervisor cannot even compose an email himself. The total staff is in disarray. Before current management was in place, it was actually a great place to work and had a promising future."
bad,Company's lackluster attitude toward drivers is so far out to left field. They fail to understand that if it wasnt for the drivers they would not have a need for corporate. The best thing they could do is sell like they did the pipeline side. They will be back in bankruptcy court again cause they have the wrong mentality to properly implement and practice what they say they stand  behind. LACK OF CORE VALUES
bad,"This Is a profit at all cost company.  Itâ€™s a 24/7 operation, but only expect 9-5, M-F support.  The culture there has become toxic.  If you enjoy being micromanaged then this is the place for you.  Do not speak up about a safety issue, because there will be retaliation.  If you do, then expect poor runs, and no maintenance for your truck.  Also, expect to be stripped of any other responsibilities which made the job enjoyable."
bad,"Easy steady work.  But if dispatch,which is the managers drinking buddy, doesn't like you then you'll get the bad loads. Loved my job but hated being singled out because I didn't go out drinking and cut corners."
bad,"Pros* PPE provided and decent health care. Wages are competitive to most of the crude hauling carriers."
bad,Cameras mounted in trucks look at you and the road...you cant imaging how ridiculous safety gets with these things...you end up  explaining the videos and getting written up by a desk jockey about how you drive
bad,Could be a great place to work if they would fix dispatch. That's not going to happen though lead dispatch is the area managers pet. If they paid all miles instead of just loaded miles they would keep trucks loaded but they only pay on loaded miles. Was driving 27 to 30% loaded and that's a very poor average to make money on. Management is also very week from the top down.
good,"Worked for this company for over 15 years, built SCADA system from the ground up."
good,"Build-out and setup new and replacement laptops/desktops for deployment.  "
good,"I've been at SemGroup 12 years and have continued to grow in my career and build relationships with great people.  Sadly, SemGroup was acquired by Energy Transfer."
good,Worked contract after company had filed for bankruptcy.  Leadership brought in was excellent and provided proper support and transition to emergence from bankruptcy.  Atmosphere was excellent and many of the employees remained there.
good,"SemGroup is an awesome company to work for. I enjoy the atmosphere and co-worker immensely. I hate leaving, but the company has relocated to Tulsa. I have a small child and can't move."
good,"Solid team, have a lot of fun while getting the tasks completed. Very professional group of team mates. Learned the ICS chain of command inside and out with table top exercises."
good,"SemGroup assets are located in Canada, the Mid-Continent and the Gulf Coast and are interconnected with key markets and logistics centers.  Footprint includes multiple shale and natural resource plays including: the Bakken Shale, DJ/Niobrara, Eagle Ford, Mississippi Lime Play and Montney/Duvernay. Our Houston Fuel Oil Terminal Company (HFOTCO) serves many refineries with crude oil terminal capabilities and is one of the largest providers of residual fuel oil storage on the Gulf Coast."
good,"If you are a Field Operator then you are in good hands. The Supervisor and co-workers are beyond helpful!! The Supervisor answers his phone 24/7. Regardless of the situation, the Field Ops team is always helpful! I read these reviews bad-mouthing the company but I realize its for other positions. Field Ops is where you want to be!!"
