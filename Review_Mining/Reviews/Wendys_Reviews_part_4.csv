good,"A typical day at work would start like this: I come to work in the morning, first thing that i would do is i would get my station ready for lunch time because it gets really busy then. When lunch starts I keep taking orders and try to get a good time. After that, i ether help on front, or I also wash dishes. I learned a lot. I remember my first day at work, i thought i will never get to know the menu, now i know all the positions. Managers, and supervisors are nice, helpful. Most of the co-workers are hard workers, always help you. The hardest part of the job, probably would be when they ask you do do something very fast, but at the same time with very good quality. For me the most enjoyable part of the job is, just to come to work. I always make work a fun place, otherwise it would be hard to work."
