rating,review
bad,"Pesima, empresa desde el motoexpert que no se porque se llama asi si no sabe nada, y los administrativos estan peores se creen la última coca en el desierto...son una basca los de recursos humanos y los couches de ventas igual de basca..."
bad,"CHRO has favorites, didn’t use survey data to make changes identified in survey, instead made her favorites bigger roles and now internal employees/managers get worse support from HR.  "
bad,"This “Inebt manager of finance in Temecula is the worst of any manager I’ve ever come across in my career.  She would bad mouth the people and procedures over her to her staff holding no regard for Gap accounting methods  and actually growling at you in a meeting of your peers when corporate managers were quoted in procedures and then never speaking or invited to another team meeting ever..They also issue their employees subpar, old and broken computers and expect you to have them fixed personally if you want to keep up on all their inadequate and outdated and crashing accounting softwares . Absolutely horrible place to be anytime and at any level.  I’ve never seen anything so appalling in my life.  Nobody has any respect at this Temecula office for the Motorola processes and has NO intention of following Simple GAP ACCOUNTING METHODOLOGY."
bad,There is nothing to say only ...as usual like c cat company. No active planning mkt awareness zero I. Offline. Less focus on genreal trade can do much better but for this need dedicate zeal manpower . Planning with full proof plan...exexuation is low.
bad,"I worked from 6am to when ever they decided I could leave, which sometimes meant 9-10pm. I loved my co-workers but absolutely hated the management. If and when I saw them, even putting all those hours in and never leaving work behind, while working multiple departments, it was never enough and would continually be berated because I was just a contract worker."
bad,Worked  here over a year then they relocated the factory. I was not able to relocate. It was a very physical job and not very easy to learn. I would not be able to do this.
bad,hated this place. hard time communicating with my co workers. too much out of work gossip and drama brought into the work place. no work ever got done. not surprised this place shut down
bad,Management use to give wrong direction and created bad culture. Nothing was a joy about this place. Members of the management use the cut throat method to solve problems instead of looking at the root cause
bad,"Another food giant, fast paced, rotation is a must. Watching code dates on products, staying organized. Keeping good moral in your store, always help controls theft"
bad,Motorola has no manufacturing facilities in the US anymore. Anyone looking to find a manufacturing job for Motorola must travel to Mexico or Shanghai China.
bad,"Meet some good people working there but Motorola doesn't hire permanent position. No insurance of any kind . And no job security, there was favoritism everywhere , the lunch room food was terrible"
bad,"None stop layoffs, never knowing when you will be next. Horrible work environment and too many ""managers"" with not enough workers actually getting the work done. Corporate makes the bottom line look good by selling off all the property in Schaumburg. The company does not care about it's employees at all. It changed from an acceptable health insurance to a ""private exchanged program"" that tripled the out of pocket costs to get the equivalent coverage. The HR Director knew this new health plan was horrible and he left, now there is an Interim HR person in there blowing smoke."
bad,"A parte mais difícil,é que não tem estabilidade,pois por ser uma empresa de eletro eletronicos,cai-se muito a produção"
bad,"no longer in existence, very stressful environment, poor leadership"
bad,met and seen new faces everyday due to the high turnover rate
bad,"Não tem planejamento eficiente, bagunça de estocagem, sem planejamento de crescimento profissional e mal tratamento interpessoal."
bad,"aprendi muito sobre tudo,poderia exercer a funçao de qualquer pessoa la dentro,porem a empresa nao tinha uma supervisao adequada e nao dava o suporte necessario."
bad,Uma empresa que dá oportunidades para pessoas que nunca trabalharam com produção
bad,Sexual harassment. I was exposed to hazardous chemicals that cause sickness to me and death to my coworkers.
bad,uma empresa boa que trabalhei sobe contrato trabalhei na produção até o fim do contrato
bad,temp with the usual chew you up and spit you out  everyone unless you knew someone worked a year and a half and was let go
bad,There could be an ongoing series of books highlighting the incredibly bizzare company called Motorola.
bad,A once great company reduced to a shell of its former self. I guess patents are worth something.
bad,Work too much and lots of people get laid off.  Benefits are good.  Vacation is good also.  But you need to be home and raise your child.   Kind of scary environment when lots of people are laid off and management does not listen to employee concerns.
bad,"In my opinion, there has been a downward movement in the company for the last ten years."
bad,"Motorola mobile device is really sinking and no hope to turn around. endless layoff make people working there very stressful, along with so many overtime work due to lack of resources."
bad,"I am very good at developing the Test Plans, Test Cases, Test scripts, Functional testing, Smoke Testing, Integration Testing, Regression Testing, system Testing."
bad,"Blatantly anti-women. One manager would scream at everyone (to the point where one programmer asked to be moved to another cube) but he picked out women for special scorn. By the end of a rant at a female colleague, he would often plead insanely saying 'why do you make me do this?' Interactions like this were common with female workers and apparently condoned."
bad,"Trabajábamos en equipo, en constante comunicación con las áreas de marketing, ventas, retail y Branding para lograr los objetivos tratados trimestralmente, éramos como una familia donde el clima laboral era muy positivo y permitía poder desarrollar tu trabajo en un ambiente pleno y confortable."
bad,"This company’s management let contractors know they’re replaceable. So it doesn’t matter how much you learn and all you do, it’ll never be enough or good enough to be hired on."
bad,Management did not take into consideration the change of times. They were into the auto body business. And the let the cell phone business go to the wayside. Otherwise Motorola was a great place to work from the supervisors to the coworkers.
bad,The best part was flexibility to work at home but this company has a lot to learn about investing in people and education. If you are looking for a long term company to work for this is not it. There is no training and employees need to dig in order to get the info needed to succeed. You are told to ask coworkers for assistance but they are reluctant to help due to job security.  If they had a plan to set people up for success the job would be more productive and less stressful for everyone. They would not have to do mass lay offs every 6 months because they want something different in the people they hired. Horrible company..horrible strategy.
bad,I worked for a company called BDS Marketing on the Moto program. I learned a lot in this position where I enjoyed working in the retail locations and having the ability to network with professionals from all of the major wireless carriers.
bad,I was fired by the Ethics Department in Retaliation of a raising a legitimate complaint. Horrible executive leaders running the company into the ground.
bad,The management were not professional and let their opinions be known to their employees they were very unprofessional and did not want anyone to have any growth in the company
bad,"The sole focus in the company is to prepare to be sold. There is a decided lack of customer focus by management.  Partial truths shared with customers as reality.  Customers rarely question as Motorola is the market leader.  HR is a joke, and consideration of employees is non-existent.  Management treatment of long term, valuable employees is abhorrent."
bad,"Long hours without pay, no job security, people dont know what they are doing."
bad,"Work was interesting, but the culture was not conducive to a comfortable work environment."
bad,Haven't had a cost of living adjustment in 5 years or any sort of merritt raise in over a decade. Even though PR remains very high. At the same time the reembursements for expenses are cut in half; they expect us to deduct it from our personal taxes. When I brought this to my bosses attention I was fired. I think this shows a lack of respect for their employees.
bad,Its ok place same time to be around just hope everything goes well that day.at the moment maybe sometimes it can be an ok place u know if everybody is nice to each their hope... right
bad,"Es una buena empresa, exigen demasiado y no hay beneficios"
bad,"Managers just care about meeting metrics, their customers are the least of the concerns.  Employees are treated like objects and laid off left and right. You have to use your 15 minute break which is by given by law any time you have to use the washrooom."
bad,"In summary, it is: Authoritarian - the boss is always right, even when he is wrong. There is no discussion allowed. Disagreement is seen as being argumentative."
bad,Whole culture changed when Motorola took over General Instrument.
bad,Motorola was the greatest and at the end the worst company I ever worked for. Over ten years I watched the culture erode away. They would literally take a group of employees from an area and lay them off because they had outsourced your position.
bad,"Nice and multicultural working atmosphere"
bad,Went From 165000 employees in 1999 to 14000 in 2015.  There were layoffs every year from 2000 on.  I would not even bother looking for any kind of long term commitment from this company.
bad,"This firm has a complacent culture due to its market share.  Management is slow to react.  People move at a very slow and frustrating speed.  This is a firm for someone that wants absolutely no stress in life but then the question becomes, for how long can this company maintain it market share dominance?"
bad,a lot of moving and being on your feet for long hours. The more work you have the faster the day goes by and finishing goals. We build radios and take them apart an put them back together for testing to make sure the product works before packaging.
bad,That's Motorola Solutions. Lots of good talent disposed of. What else is new.
bad,Too much old-school thought here with no innovation. Spend years on commercializing new projects that may never see the light of day. Or continue to fix CRs with existing products that are cash cows
bad,"Motorola was a great company yo work for with great people ,great benefits,great insurance,great job advancements, great pay,great hours,great working conditions."
bad,"I worked for Motorola just as it was being split into parts and sold into separate entities. The group I worked for was sold to Nokia, and have no insight into how it is now."
bad,"During new employee orientation, I learned company was at an all-time high of employees.  Lay-offs started second month of my employment.  Survived numerous rounds of lay-off, but with my lay-off company sunk to 40% of the peak when I was hired."
bad,"kept busy but high turn over of staff..i learned it takes team work,management should have more involvement with staff,who knew the products..hard part was the 12 hour shifts..the most enjoyable was the the finished product working"
bad,"The hours of work are very flexible and people are very independent. After working in Motorola, you will definitely come out with a strong resume as the job is very demanding and complex. Do not expect job security, however. I am surprise to see so many positions available right now after their recent lay offs of a great number of employees. Motorola is very stock oriented so they do not hesitate when it comes to down-size and outsource. They have recently sold their LAST facility in So Fla and are currently leasing. I don't see any long term plans for the Engineers in So Fla."
bad,"Ótimo para trabalhar ,pessoas que sempre te tratam bem ,aprendi varias coisas como cuidados com aparelhos e que uma equipe tem que ser unida acima de tudo ."
bad,"My Typical work day starts with looking at my emails and creating a task list."
bad,"Pude ver minha capacidade e agilidade no trabalho, o quanto é importante a cooperação de cada um que faz parte de uma equipe."
bad,"Very poor management and leadership. Unconsistant hours, sometimes you can get overtime, other times they cut days of the week out of your schedule. Severe lack of discipline and organization."
bad,"Motorola when its original form was a good company to work for.  Once they divested Motorola Mobility to Google then the legacy Symbol Technologies to Zebra, it began to be a hard place to work."
bad,"As a global company I was surprised at the lack of communications within the company. As  I was assigned to the Engineering department I can only speak for what happened here, but communications was definitely lacking. "
bad,Continual erosion of what was once a powerhouse of industry.  People walk around with their head down hoping not to be noticed so that they can avoid the next round of layoffs.
bad,"AVERAGE Co. you dont get much scope to Excel."
bad,"Very political atmosphere where you had to be part of the""club"" for advancement or promotions. They laid off my manager just to put someone in the role who knew way less and with way less knowledge and experience...pure politics"
bad,Was a good company to work for until the CEO lost sight of their most important asset which was their workers. Worked in teams to solve problems but the work was out sourced out of country.
bad,"Its an okay place to work only if your looking for a temp job, simply because that exactly what it is (temp). They do not hire on and they take it one day at a time. One day they might ask you to work 8 to 12 hours, or they will tell you to go home after 4 hours. If you life about a hour away, going to work for only 4 hours would feel like a buzzkill."
bad,"Not a good work culture with a very conservative work culture and a conservative work environment."
bad,"This was a good first job for me out of college."
bad,Motorola spun out its semiconductors.  Then it continued to be parceled out until it essentially no longer exists as the entity I originally joined.
bad,Esta empresa no tiene solides con los empleados no respeta los dias  festivos
bad,"Churn and burn environment with little chance for advancement or ability to have an impact if not in the ""inner circle"". Driving good experienced people away or letting them go regardless of performance."
bad,"Motorola is very, very fast-paced environment and an uncertainty about its future that makes everyone anxious. I'm glad I was only a contractor."
bad,Huge corporate culture restricts the software development.
bad,"Difficult to reach manager. HR unresponsive. Layoffs were a constant concern. Most of my coworkers were released with little to no notice. "
bad,"Typical day was always the same. Workplace was tense when ever the admin was around. She seems to be the manager.  The most enjoyable part was the co workers.  Admin was not people friendly,  her way or the highway.  Hardest part of the job was trying to get along with her.  Thats why people were always quiting. Her attitude was not friendly only with people she liked."
bad,This was a contract salary job for different cellular providers. It was a stressful job as you were dealing with primarily Spanish speaking clients who don't have any inclination on programming a cellular device.
bad,"I was treated well, but I worked for a consulting company that had contracts with Motorola. I watched as employees were treated poorly. Perhaps it's better now, but I doubt it."
bad,Great peer group to work with.. but everyone was over worked and very stressed out about the job.  Plenty of opportunities to grow but the workforce reductions continued to make it more difficult to take time for PD.
bad,"Motorola has not care for his employees."
bad,aprendi a função de embalagem e organização da linha e abastecimento
bad,"Outdated processes and bureaucracy."
bad,"Motorola was once a GREAT company with great leadership and vision. This is no longer the case, it is a business that is in fast decline. With the pressure and stress of declining numbers management has become increasingly hostile and belittling. So great management still exists but the culture has become hostile."
bad,"Gud to work .But there is no job security , which really depresses us"
bad,"Easy job"
bad,"um ambiente com pessoas boas ,porém desorganizada , não é a área que eu teria gosto de trabalhar ."
bad,Motorola lost thier way back in the mid 90's still looking for a way out of that hole
bad,Muy mal manejo de la gente a cargo y cuota muy altas
bad,"Por ser uma empresa muito grande, nao tinhamos um bom relacionamento com os colegas de trabalho. "
bad,"The software group produces very little software code.  Roughly 10% of the staff hours go towards actual software production.  The group spends a significant time performing  manual testing.  One former team member described this as a test group, not a software group.  The group does not use contemporary project management tools, but uses word processors and spreadsheets.  The RM tool is a word processor.  A significant amount of time goes into meetings.  Without an agenda, the meetings turn into stream of consciousness, with many point repeated and belabored."
bad,"muita correria, empresa tumultuada, desorganizada, salario baixo"
bad,"Many, many iterations of trying to get the software organization right. Lots of churn, and likely still more to come. They seem to be closer to getting there. Culture is getting better but still very much command and control. Lots of interesting problems to solve and an impactful domain to work in (public safety). Career mobility in Salt Lake is limited, directors and VPs have always been in Chicago or (more recently) Seattle."
bad,"This was a temporary job, very fast paced."
bad,"The do more with less culture at Motorola means putting more work on less amount of people. Does not value PEOPLE. Values CEO making money. The company went from innovation, and focusing on domestic talent to our sourcing, consolidating in higher cost centers, and keeping current talent over worked."
bad,la verdad no me quejo tanto pero si deberian de cambiar muchos aspectos como el sueldo uniformes y demas
bad,Constant cuts. The competition in this protected market is growing quickly with overseas entrants. Margins reducing and partly causing job cuts year over year.
bad,"Motorola was a wonderful company at some point, but just not in the few years that I worked there. I worked in the sales organization and found that the sales people always put profits in front of the customer, no matter what. Designs and reliability were second always to making more commission and looking great from a finance standpoint. This was not a collaborative environment and I resigned rather that stay."
bad,"did not like working here.  Worked in a clean room with lots of machinery, running lines, replacing broken parts, looking through microscope most of the day"
bad,"Management sees employees as a number. There is no working with you in training and advancement opportunities."
bad,"Motorola continues to change to meet challenges"
bad,"The company has been solely focused on short term bottom line earnings, giving no attention to top line and long term growth.  Motorola developed Six Sigma in the market place and was first Malcolm Baldridge award winner.  Today, Motorola has one person responsible for quality worldwide.  There are no quality measures, project quality or customer satisfaction surveys.  Senior people with institutional knowledge are being let go due to high salaries in order to improve bottom line."
bad,"wimax feature testing onnew releases"
bad,Flexible work hours. 20+ PTO per year. One of the biggest companies in Chicago area. Currently in the midst of re-organization and consolidation.
bad,The balance between life and work was 90% work.  Had room for advancement for entry level but not much for mid to senior level professionals.
bad,No job security. Hard to advance. Benefits slowly going away.
bad,"Was a long time employee till recently, too many uncertainities, senior management now a days more fixed on helping Wall Street investors then employees.  It used to be a great company but not any more.  Very little room to grow and office politics is horrible.  Supervisors and management are too busy fighting amongst each other.  No one listens to each other and each one is trying to other make look bad.  I left very disappointed.  They did help pay for my school which I'm thankful for and I always got the pay check on time  Large layoffs are very demoralizing and there is always worry about job security.   Was discriminated for job opportunities and those who had connections got it without much to show."
bad,"Since it was only 1 year contract a software tester, I don't have enough information for a review."
bad,Poor Management - no guidance or leadership. Excellent performance is not appreciated. Its hard to advance unless you have very good connections - nepotism is prevalent.
bad,"The company itself is not too bad. Nice office, bonuses, raises. However the bonuses and raises are pretty small and insignificant. You will never get a promotion so don't even try. Management is handled ok, but don't be surprised if someone  (in a high management position) you have never heard and has never heard of you cuts off your project and lays you off, because he just googled flutter and thinks that cross development with offshoring is the way to go. I have literally seen that happen 3 times. And that high ranking manager will get replaced by someone even more dumb when they realize the offshore team can't deliver.  Each time they had to scrape the new offshore flutter and then re-hire onshore. Then a large amount of onshore people will be thrilled to work at an American company. IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS COMPANY... THEN MAKE THEM PAY YOU COMPETITIVE RATES! DO NOT WORK FOR THEM FOR STABILITY, CAUSE THEY LAY OFF MANY PEOPLE EVERY YEAR. SERIOUSLY... GOOGLE IT."
bad,Motorola Foundations allows the employees to participate in volunteering efforts with the community. Also has a matching program where they match the employee donation.
bad,"I have been working at Motorola Solutions full-time for more than 3 years"
bad,I would not recommend working here.  My job has been threatened twice in 4 years from restructuring type activities and this time I'm choosing not to take an internal opportunity.
bad,"Rigid management, poor in compensation ,lack of growth and advancement opportunities................"
bad,"I felt like I was not treated the same as other people in my department, perhaps because I relocated and they had different expectations.  The feedback I received from management was inconsistent."
bad,"Typical day begins with the tasks, goals and expectation for the day. These information is filtered appropriately to all team members and set the tone for the day"
bad,"good company with very wrong and out of dated procedures ."
bad,"Once a great place to work with many diverse opportunities.  Now a company that, while profitable and financially reasonably healthy, has been on a 10+ year downward trajectory.  Core radio products serve a very narrow segment.  Trying to find a new direction.  Constant downsizing and layoffs, many people leaving on their own.  Very poor morale."
bad,"a lot of politics & very minimal chances for career growth, a lot of flexibility, good people"
bad,"Easy work, unstable schedules, ok management, financially unstable, jobs going to Mexico."
bad,"Good for education and work life balance. Have a heart. You talk about valuing your people, but you put profits above all else. You outsource without blinking an eye. The ONLY reason to outsource is to improve the Bottom Line. That means putting profits above People."
bad,"Too much cronyism, favoritism and politics.  Too many little empires - ""camps"" and they are called.  To be recognized and promoted, one must have friends and do a lot of ""kissing u-know-what"".   I know that a lot of this is true everywhere one works.  but its especially bad in Sunrise, Fl... FL08 location."
bad,Not as good as other big companies... Seemed too deep in process
bad,"I work in the federal support department and the work is interesting. A typical day consists of checking if the customer submitted any trouble tickets and if so, address them."
bad,The main learing from this role was to never work in back office sales for telecomms. I became the scapegoat for several issues and management was in place through circumstance more than professionalism and experience
bad,"Empresa forte para trabalhar, porém muitas coisas deixam a desejar como pagamentos, comissões, promessas de promoções."
bad,"Motorola is a classic example of a company that shed too many people and as a result most of the people there are actually doing several roles because there aren't enough bodies around to get it all done. I found that was the case in every department.  They try to do as much work as possible with as few people as possible. "
bad,"Very fast paced job, doing a great job doesn't necessarily mean good compensations, no recognition for engineers."
bad,"lots of politics"
bad,"Un dia como cualquiera ,lleno de mucho trabajo y poco descanso , tuvimos unos problemas de calidad.por defectos..que tenia un retrabajo,,y nos levantaron reporte,"
bad,processing of microchips in clean room environment writing work SOP and procedures
bad,"Watched Motorola grow, for 20 good years, until it all started getting shipped overseas. Many good people lost their job, some that were there a lifetime, only to get booted a few years prior to retirment. Wish Motorola would have fought for the US employees a little harder."
bad,"Local onde tive boas oportunidades de crescimento e de acúmulo de conhecimento, ótimo ambiente de socialização e contatos."
bad,"La empresa se ha quedado en el pasado en todos sus ámbitos.  Cultura utilitarista totalmente enfocada en la facturación, con miles de políticas que se ven muy bien en el papel y los reportes, pero sin utilidad.  Demasiada burocracia.  Muy buena gente y buen ambiente en la oficina."
bad,"Co-workers were great!"
bad,Dinâmico
bad,The manger has his favorite. The manger is picky about who he chooses to give positions too. The work is slow for the most part. I was there for a whole year and half. In maybe worked 7 months. The rest of the time I had to just sit there in look stupid. They show favoritism toward different people.  I couldn't do what everyone else doing. Like having work to keep busy. Anwearing I open toe
bad,I really like this job but it was just to far and they always laying u off the job was not consistent and I needed to make sure my job was a full time position and permanent job
bad,"I had a terrible experience here with a dreadful boss. Salary was low. The territory covered was insanely large. The day to day job wasn't terrible, but my boss made it unbearable."
bad,I can't in good conscience write a proper review on Motorola since I have not worked for them for more than 17 years. It was a decent company to work for back then.
bad,Great company that has sunk to the very bottom. Very little new or useful being generated and they pale in comparison to the great tech companies of the world
bad,"Motorola is a shadow of the tech giant it once was.  It continues to survive in its remaining market--public safety--but no longer pursues the research and development focus that it once did, and would not be a good choice if you're looking for long-term job stability."
bad,"I like working with this company, but when something bad happened, it was pushed under the rug.  Very disappointing, and that is why I left the organization."
bad,The turn around rate is huge. Building a relationship with your co workers is non existent and also challenging when there is a lot of work.
bad,"Motorola had a good work life balance, great colleagues to work with. But now it is not really doing great."
bad,"Not really sure I can review Motorola as there isn't much of the original organization left.  What was once a technology forerunner is merely a shadow of its former self.  Sad story, really."
bad,"great benefits"
bad,"- Teilnahme an Kundengesprächen"
bad,"Learned something new each day loved working with all employees and management. Some very long days"
bad,"Acho que quando buscamos aprender sempre, temos que estar em uma empresa que nos permita um crescimento e desenvolvimento profissional, e quando não encontramos essas oportunidades, é natural buscarmos em outros lugares."
bad,training on some communications tools and mobile communication
bad,"Motorola Home Division was sold to Arris in Dec 2012, expected to close in 2Q2013, company in transition"
bad,"This is not a good place for entry level employees. My senior manager did not have skills to manage his staffs. For example, very high level senior engineer who have a Ph. D degree talked and acted with his one of the department staffs very uneducated manner."
bad,You could not advance in your job. Workers were not competant enough for their task. Morale was low. Managers were more interested in new methodoligies than listening to their workers.
bad,It's like every other warehouse or employers they expect your best and just interacting with different characters could make your typical day at work what you let it to be. The hardest part of the job was helping other departments and working with employees who were not team players. The most enjoyable part of the job was when our supervisors would thank us for a job well done.
bad,sim  empresa otima de se trabalhar prestativa em tudo  zela pelo funcionario foi um lugar muito bom de se trabalhar
bad,"Rotina diária, Manutenção dos aparelhos expostos."
bad,Um dia típico de trabalho seria aquele em que nada de extraordinário acontece.
good,Just not a friendly place to work at.  There is a lot of inhouse politics and not what i felt was comfortable.  Hours are ok but alot of over time which isnt so great when your on salary. day starts at 8 am and sometimes we are there until 10 pm.
good,Its not a good place to work. The  work life balance is not good. It has non-flexible work hours. Lot of differentiation between employees and contractors.
good,"Aprendizado em tecnologia e telecomunicações, produção e boa equipe."
good,"Tested Smartphones and forwarded reports ,"
good,"No future for being a contractor but work environment is fine"
good,"Empresa da área de telecomunicações, tinha muita oportunidades de melhorias. Oferecia trabalho temporário, sem muita perspectiva de efetivação."
good,These were my early jobs in the United states with a 50/50 Technical and Management responsibility.
good,When working for Motorola the atmosphere at the beginning seem very promising in what was being searched for when it came to the hiring process. Then once hired the image painted was just an illusion. No opportunity to move up in the company and all the were in management made it to where all they spoke to were their favorites and not to communicate and encourage advancement at the work place
good,"por 5 anos , aprendi que pessoas diferentes são uns desafios de aprendizado nem tanto pela operação em si, mas, determinadas situações exigem sabedoria e estrategia para elevar o nivel de companherismo e transforma o ambiente agradavel. A Louca maneira de metas , tambem , eram empregnadas pela supervisão de maneira aspera e rude , deixando a todos , apreensões pela produtividade , eu aprendi muito a lidar com essas divergencias"
good,Making the sale is often done at the expense of the engineering teams. The most enjoyable part of the job is exceeding public safety workers expectations.
good,"Unfortunately, not the ideal place to work for me. People were friendly enough and helpful when required. The training for new staff though was atrocious. Coming from a server background to a radio based environment they did not have the skill set for up training recruits. Read documentation only is managements method. The regular staff did provide hands on guidance when asked."
good,"Essa empresa trabalhei pouco tempo para avaliar, porém estrutura boa, transporte bom... refeitório maravilhoso"
good,I worked here right out of college and it was temporary position with no future of being hired. It was right during the recession so company's were not hiring. Also Motorola was not doing so well. So it was more of stepping stone position.
good,"It is a very proffesional place to work. But for some reason, which I do not know, people there are not always so friendly and also less co-operative in projects."
good,"Motorola continues to reduce the UK resources and has announced closure of it's flagship premises in Basingstoke."
good,Company once a brilliant star today a name ans assets to be sold
good,woked hard got no where. you are a number. be there on time every day do your job don't make a mistake.
good,"Often find a great group of workers who are dedicated, collaborative and innovative. Most difficult part of the job is the constant redirection of projects from upper management."
good,"Motorola was an excellent place to work but with the economic conditions declining and management not staying in line with current technologies overall Motorola appears not to be a leader but less than a followerer. Their overall management structure has not followed as an industry leader, hey are stuck with the ""good old boy network"" in control and allot of middle managers that are not qualified to manage or have little or noone reporting to them. Motorola should take a hard look at middle management and above and remove 75% of them."
good,"Na empresa Motorola se aprende a: Programar os celulares, retirar suas falhas, enfim a trabalhar em uma linha de produção. Existe uma gerência bem organizada. O mais difícil de trabalhar lá são os horários e a falta de apoio que os funcionários tem em relação aos estudos referente a estágios. A parte mais agradável é que eles fornecem transporte e refeição dentro da empresa, o que não precisava ficar se preocupado."
good,"I would not recommend Motorola. yes they have great benefits but they culture, well they have no culture. It changes all the time and seems to evolve into something they did not want. A lot of turn over in high level positions. It means a lot of direction changing. Never know when you would be called into the office to be let go."
good,"Jembas is recognized as the largest provider in two-way radio communications in Luanda Angola, Africa with Motorola being a partner. Installations of variety of Telecommunication equipment and systems in ten (10) provincial sites like linking a head office to another branch office extending the voice, data, and video services."
good,"It was my outsource job, so cant share much about this, but Yes indeed a good start for fresher it was to gain a knowledge on field experience."
good,"The work at Motorola Solutions is quarterly based. The beginning of the quarter leaves people without work while the end of the quarter becomes stressful and fast paced. There is no room for growth within the company. All in all, the pay does not seem worth the stress that this job can bring."
good,"As a temporary employee, the environment was very confusing to me.  It was not clear to whom I would be reporting to.  Communication during various projects was extremely sketchy."
good,"On January 29, 2014, Page announced that pending closure of the deal, Motorola Mobility would be acquired by Chinese technology company Lenovo for US$2.91 billion (subject to certain adjustments). On October 30, 2014, Lenovo finalized its purchase of Motorola Mobility from Google."
good,Work was great when I started but it is not like it used to be. Management is old and visionless. Compensation sucks and career growth is non-existent.
good,"My advice would be that, while I understand it’s important to keep the share holders happy we also need to keep the employees happy too. Talent retention should be right up there with talent acquisition and feel that’s not a priority. I do like the CEO however I feel like a stronger vision for the company is needed."
good,Performed physical testing and minor repairs on pagers for major telecommunication companies.
good,Was a great place to work. job was challenging and I enjoyed it.
good,Motorola is in a constant state of flux due to the advent of other companies taking away their market share. Very seldom do you ever see your manager or get to speak to them.
good,Plenty of interesting work to do but always worrying about layoffs and office politics.
good,"This was a temp job in my studies time. Very uncoordinate company, it wa a complete mess"
good,My department is equivalent of the frontlines in war where we see the most action but have the highest turnover rate. Management constantly changes it mind and gets mad at employees for not abiding my day to day changes to procedure. After hours duty provides a switch and bait opportunity for job advancement but is only a 'volunteer' and necessary part of the job that sucks for soul and keeps you on the phone 24/7. No social life allowed.
good,"If you like digital sweat shops, low pay in relation to effort then jump on the Motorola customer support through BNA.  Constant calls, no breaks in between call and every action you take tracked and questioned."
good,Good place to work. Hours were adequate with the weekends off. Learned a lot about phone processing and production. The whole company was full of kind people.
good,"Company provided engineers with opportunities to work in many different disciplines. Since a cellular device requires expertise in mechanical design, RF/Baseband integration, Antenna design, camera design, audio design, display design, power management, manufacturing and quality control, being hired at Motorola allowed you to work in a discipline of your choice and get exposure to many others in the process as you wold work very closely with other people from other disciplines,"
good,A lot of political intrigue. Slow to react to changes in marketplace. More focused on protecting legacy market positions than exploring emerging market trends and technical needs.
good,A very enjoyable and interesting job! Timekeeping and communication skills were important! Listening to instructions were key as this is what made the job go to plan
good,"It seems that the external reputation of the company is strong, but management seems to have a ""do more with less"" mentality that creates a hostile environment, and undue strain on the organizations."
good,"I worked on cross-functional teams including Process Engineering, Test, and Quality/Reliability Engineering. I was the Quality Engineering liaison with international customers. Interfacing with customers was rewarding."
good,"When I started at Motorola in the 90's, it was a huge company involved in many segments.  Over time, it has shrank substantially."
good,um dia normal de trabalho aprendi muitas coisa lá bem agradaveis a direção era bem complicada no sentido de separar os funcionarios os colegas tinha bastante conhecimento a parte mais dificil na hora de bater o ponto muita gente e poucos aparelhos de ponto a parte agradavel que a cada dia aprendia mais.
good,"I worked with several people.. from our sub-contractors to engineers, to project managers and our audit group. The hardest part of the job is learning as you go. No one had the time to explain the processes required to accomplish a task. The most enjoyable part would be learning to accomplish things without much or any training."
good,"era de segunda a sexta um bom horário .Eu aprendi a ter mais agilidade com as coisas.  "
good,"It is not a well managed company."
good,"While the work was usually interesting, it was not clear who would survive the massive layoffs of 2013. It seemed like workers were cut without much regard or compassion. And remaining workers were loaded up with impossible work loads."
good,"The company is flexible with your work timings, but it doesn't offer good growth opportunities."
good,"downsizing company that wants to hold on to profit share."
good,Overall a great job to have. I would imagine other Motorola facilities are similar and hopefully still focused on quality products.
good,"Ótima empresa para se trabalhar, local limpo e organizado, de fácil aprendizado, ótimos benefícios como refeição no local, fretado e convênio médico. A única dificuldade nos dias de hoje é a terceirização, então torna se mto mais difícil se tornar um funcionário efetivo, mas mesmo assim o salário e os benefícios compensam a experiência."
good,"Empresa legal de trabalhar, depois que trocou de agencia ficou melhor,teve muitas melhorias umas delas o aumento do vale refeição."
good,"It was an easy job, but not exactly fulfilling - it was temporary work through manpower. They cycle through hundreds of people and some of the managers are to put i plainly - rude and impatient - especially towards older folks working there. The pay through manpower was decent and the hours were plentiful."
good,OK Cnahnged allot over the years. No longer a really good co. to work for.
good,"Una buena industria para ejercer ventas, buen flujo de clientes."
good,"No issues here, was hired by a fabulous manager who soon left the company. I was there at a time of transition with not a lot of job security. I learned a lot during my time with them"
good,"When I worked for Motorola, I was in the IT department.  They always needed more people in the phone department.  so they were constantly taking head counts from the other departments and turning them over to phones."
good,"Motorola has sold off many of its core business, and not the same company as it was when I started. It is now a shell of what the company used to be. When they sold off the cellular infrastructure division to Nokia, top management sold it as a great deal, and they would also be part of the transaction, but when push came to shove, they found a way out of the sale.  Nokia did not really want the people, but rather the customers."
good,"Application specialists spend 85% of your time on an airplane or living in a hotel. 3 day work weeks are nice but do not make up for lost time at home. The job itself is fairly technical and requires a lot of questions/group discussions. This job is a perfect fit for a single person but if you have a family and enjoy spending time with them, I would not consider this job."
good,"Motorola Solutions is an old company that is struggling to change it's identity and keep up with other technology companies.  The CEO is managing the company from Quarter to Quarter.  They have split/sold off parts of the company over the years and have had to lay thousands of good, smart people off because they are unable to get the company moving in a positive direction. "
good,Motorola Was a great company to work or but now has lost its vision. Everything is about the money no matter and Management does not look out for their workers.
good,"At one time one of the most admired companies where there was clear growth. These days, the growth is very limited. "
good,The actual workers who work for Motorola act like the contractors have like no experience in anything . Some of them are cool but the managers definitely have favorites and some people get away with certain types of situations which isn't cool.  Every one should be treated the same whether you are a contractor or an actual employee.
good,"Not a bad company and we were busy all the time so that was nice. also the company vehicle and gas card was awsome, but there were no raises, no bonuses,"
good,"Dally basis, check the emails and started working on the job assigned to me. Used my spire times working with other team as well. Good management of my work so that I can finish my work on time. Hardest part of the job is the communication gap. Most enjoyable part of the job is if every body look at you positively."
good,Things have changed since my time.  This once great company's time has past.  Friends who still work there wonder if they will have a job when they go in in the morning.  The managers that I worked for when I left were a joke.
good,"used to be fun, but with the lack of leadership the work environment has deteriorated......."
good,"Never a dull moment, there is always something new and different each day. Each day begins with daily responsibilities with added challenges. Working in a team environment is the most important part of the day and the job."
good,when i was worked with them i learned out to operate machine and out  relate to other co-workers
good,Fast pace work culture; diverse assignments.  Good environment for new graduates.
good,"MSI formerly Motorola used to be a pretty good place to work.  Over the last 10 years or so they seem to have lost their way understanding that you still need people to do work and you have to respect them.  You also have to respect your customers.  "
good,"No growth, software development outsourced, new opportunities in services."
good,"The MOT Home division was a great place to work with great people and an exciting product."
good,"Uma empresa agradável de se trabalhar, tendo como em qualquer outra lugar seus dias tranquilos, produtivos, estressantes."
good,a avaliação que eu tenho sobre a motorola é que é uma empresa dinamica e que eu aprendi algumas coisas la dentro que eu vou levar pra sempre comigo
good,Its ok it was a 1099 contract job good hours and the people were nice. Would have liked to work longer but the contract ran out and no postion to hire
good,"It was just ok. That was long ago. I lost motivation while working there because there seemed to be too much office politics and secrecy there."
good,"Long time employee. Previously a wonderful place to work. Under utilized IT department which isn't pushed to find cutting edge solutions. Relies too much on outsourcing. Stagnant development for employees, however excels at work/life balance and remote working with desirable benefits."
good,I was not impressed with the training or job preparation. Long training hours but ineffective to do the actual job. Employees are expected to learn a lot of technical information on their own.
good,"In the day, equipment was serviced, installed and repaired by the techs,  now most is module or unit replacement with programming being the main function."
good,The company has a strong RF engineering team but the management constantly make mistakes due to lack of long term strategies. Often result in fall behind other competitors.
good,"There is a lot that goes on in the company.  The customer base is very demanding and cost savings seems to be a higher priority than keeping their customer base happy.  People did their jobs well and the company is making high profit margins, yet we still send jobs to other countries to meet shareholder demand."
good,"Motorola solution s a fast paced and interesting place to work, but the management there very myopic and not focused on quality."
good,"Not a single person was hired as an employee, they were brought in by temp agencies.  They had long-term workers but they were still working through the temp agency."
good,Benefits and bonus in terms of stock options have cut heavily.  There is no stock options for employees any more unless you're in top level management.  Benefit costs have risen over the years.
good,This is the type of job that is slow paced. You do not have many opportunities for advancement. The work is not hard just a lot of it. You stay behind a desk all day.
good,Motorola was a good place to work. My manager was great and so were my coworkers. I expanded my technical knowledge to include working in a date center.
good,"Empresa dominou o mercado de celulares no início do serviço no Brasil, mas ficou estagnada e demorou a perceber os erros internos."
good,"It used to be great to work at Motorola but over time things have changed. Motorola is no longer interested in innovating or providing quality solutions. Most existing products have entered the maintenance stage. Many company reorganizations and shifting around management has lead to leaders who don't know what they're leading anymore and barely know the business associated with the team they're assigned. They expect long hours and no longer pay competitive salaries for the Chicago region in general. Quality was born at Motorola in 1980s, but today quality is often an after thought. Management would prefer spending the least amount of dollars and effort possible to get things pushed out the door to meet the bottom line. Then they'll deal with the defects from the field later. All this said, the company wants to focus on becoming an IT oriented services based company now since they think this will increase their ability to make ongoing revenue and improve shareholder value. So a lot of money has been taken from the core products of the company shift to these new areas. So if you work in the services part of the company you might do better than working for any of the old core business."
good,"too many MBA managers who lacks the understanding of the technology roadmap to drive the next generation of the technological solutions. A lot of great visions but lack of technologist executioners. Motorola was once a leader in communication technology, but then, lack of understanding the consumer needs to produce products that consumers want."
good,"Mucha rotacion de personal, no se premia el rendimiento sino todo lo contrario, las jefaturas en general no se involucran en la forma de trabajo de sus empleados"
good,There are great people here you will come to meet and work with. There are pros and cons to any place of employment we choose to go to. Working here you will see the positives and negatives that come associated with working in such an environment. If your observant you'll see all you need to know. Not a bad place to work at.Can be used as a steppingstone.
good,"Uma empresa com dificuldade de executar um trabalho assertivo, com um fluxo de contratações e demissões muito alto."
good,"Shrinking sales and workforce. "
good,You definitely learn a lot from the talented colleagues throughout the different departments.  Organic innovation is slow.  Strategy is to invest in smaller companies and leverage their technologies.  Total compensation erodes over the years.
good,A small company in the area of telecommunication industry in Bangladesh from where i came to learn about the basics of Radio Network
good,"The company's value is in the people. Very talented at all levels. The future of the company is at stake, and its leaders are expected to maintain the great name of Motorola and deliver the future."
good,Good place to work but advancement limited and opportunity yo move around to gain experience limited to what your are doing
good,"My division, like many other parts of Motorola, was sold off.  It seems like an odd strategy to sell as much as they can, and then make an occasional acquisition, possibly to get something else to sell.  I am not sure if they have a strategy left beyond selling what they have.  "
good,"Pros:"
good,"The tattered remains of a once great American juggernaut with even greater leadership, torn apart by stock market greed.  But we still make radios better than anybody."
good,"It was a good place to work, clean and very professional way to work at a big company such as Motorola. People there are nice."
good,"We were working on products that provide critical infrastructure to emergency communication for first res-ponders.. that was a rewarding feeling of contributing towards saving lives. "
good,"Having a cross functional engineering position in Motorola's supply chain was nice in the fact that I got to interact with multiple teams frequently. I made really good friends while I was there. Working with different teams was fun and engaging. I was able to learn a lot about Six Sigma and earned a Green Belt certification with the help of a great Black Belt mentor. The stock purchase plan is also an amazing perk that results in guaranteed returns."
good,"Me parece que es una empresa con gran capacidad de desarrolo y ventas por su renombre y calidad de sus productos perp que tiene falencias en la comunicacion y facilitamiento de herramientas para que sus asesores cumplan las metas dispuestas asi sea un asesor temporal ya que para uno como empleado es la comision algo de suma importancia para el desarrollo optimo del trabajo y es un poco frustrante que los asesores externos a motorola; los clientes y otros reciban mas incentivos que el asesor que hace mucho mas. En mi caso particular hice gran cantidad de ventas y al final mi supervisor me comunico que no cumplimos con la meta y no recibi nada, sabiendo que se desarrolo un muy buen trabajo y las mediciones que se me hicieron desde que entre hasta la fecha que tenia de plazo para cumplir no fue hecha dia por dia y asi es dificil. El ambiente laboral si fue muy bueno, ya que hubo mucho trabajo y buenas ventas, buen apoyo por parte del distribuidor que colaboro mucho con ventas y la marca hizo eventos que incentivaron mucho la venta.Me gusto mucho del trabajo que todo el dia habia que hacer algo, aprendi a cerrar ventas muy rapido por que habia gran competencia, trabajar en equipo para lograr las metas diarias y desarrollar estrategias de venta."
good,"some time no work, some time much work, beautiful lunch area, management good, co-worker ok."
good,They follow older primitives and Many layoffs. Co workers are good
good,"Very process oriented, lots of talented engineers working in a fast paced environment."
good,"The technology that Motorola Solutions is exciting.   The work, providing communications equipment for First responders, is meaningful."
good,"Significant cutbacks every quarter. The result is that everyone is looking over their shoulder trying to figure out if they are next."
good,Motorola is fun place to work. I enjoyed working these for six months.
good,"From 160K employees / scientists / inventors, to 16K drones.  Be active, look busy, or get fired."
good,I would go to the temp service and they would send me to whatever job was available if any
good,"co ordination with clinets , consultants and all the contarctors to complete the project as per the agreed schedule ,cost and time"
good,"Travail à faire, avec tests journaliers sur les équipements."
good,"Unix admin"
good,"A huge company. You can get lost in there. That's why they say it has job security, but you can be let go when they get into financial trouble."
good,empresa com tecnologia comum ao mercado. necessidade de conhecimento principalmente em radios de comunicação e automação comercial.
good,"audit freight bills for accuracy before payment. trace shipment, proof of delivery. worked with accounts payable closely."
good,"Quando a empresa é boa, o dia de trabalho é satisfatório aprendi como montar celular como também verificar nas inspeção defeitos elétricos e nas peças, nunca tive problemas com gerências , com colegas temos que trabalhar em conjunto para ser um ambiente agradável ,a parte mais difícil é nos primeiros dias por que nós não conhecemos o trabalho , a parte boa é que nosso aprendizado tanto profissional como pessoal são aperfeiçoado!"
good,"There are a lot of different areas of work that are available such as developing IT like systems, virtual server developement, mobile application development, etc."
good,motorola é uma empresa otima para trabalhar eu aprendi a montangem de um celular a direção da empresa em algumas são boas em outras fica devendo.os colegas de trabalho são todos muito atenciosos
good,Was a good place to work until they put a marketing person in as CEO who did not know how to run an engineering company. Company laid off most of their senior technical staff.
good,The job was just a stepping stone for me when I moved back to Arkansas. I got this job through a temp service and it was just temperary until I got a better paying job.
good,Decent job but continual layoffs.The atmosphere is casual and the staff is nice. Sometimes challenging to manage waterfall and Agile methods.
good,"Everyone at Motorola has been there forever. The company stand behind product lines that are essentially obsolete, but continue to push them for their own job security. Motorola is a very disorganized company, due to all of the different silos."
good,Enjoyed the job and enjoyed the laugh with other guys but wasnt for me long term\!!!!!!!
good,"Can be a good place to work for someone who has expertise in the field. Coming from someone who did a internship, there were a lot of obstacles to learn everything. I was able to work from home almost anytime I wanted to, though there were many conference calls."
good,"Motorola Solutions isn't the same as Motorola. The company is now only interested in fresh graduates, mostly H1B visa. Existing employees are being replaced every quarter."
good,The pros of this company is that it is traditional and fairly solid in the businesses they serve. The drawbacks are related to the fact that it is not a forward looking company & not a place to get that sort of experience at.
good,"Enjoyed my years with Motorola Semiconductor, but due to poor planning and vision, Motorola Semiconductor could not compete with Intel and even much smaller, but agile, semiconductor manufacturers.  Closed all semiconductor manufacturing operations in the Phoenix area by 2005."
good,I have learned to manage different roles and projects at the same time. I was  surrounded by great people and were very supportive when there are challenges at work
good,This is a well known company but you work your but off for this company then they lay you off after theu make a mistake  in projects proffits and the division collapses
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar quando tem demanda de pedidos,."
good,trabajos que te permiten desarrollarte sin poner trabas
good,"Starting from an engineering firm, Motorola was very male centered workplace.  They could have done a lot more about advancing women.  I knew one woman who tried for 15 years to move from Administrative Assistant to another field.  They should have moved all of the detail oriented Administrative Assistants into Project Management or Operations.  HR was just concerned with figuring out big packages for executives who were leaving. Some of the execs were very devious."
good,"Motorola was a good company to work for.  However, when they started integrating departments, there was a lack of communication between individuals, all because of people wanting to continue to work with old rules and regulations.  Incidents occurred where people were adhering to their old job functions rather than working with new rules that were implemented.  Downsizing became a big part of the moves around the company and many people either left or were forced to resign."
good,"I worked there a very long time ago, and have no idea if the place is even there anymore, or whether my position still exists, wherever Motorola is now."
good,This company used to be great but over the years they have reduced the company back down to its core business and just keep cutting headcount every year.   Everyone is stressed and miserable.  They keep cutting support staff and putting more work on the remaining people.
good,"Very challenging and resourceful support group."
good,"Motorola used to be a great hardware company, radios, phones etc.  They have lost their way and now focusing of software and services, neither of which they have been strong at over the years."
good,a amizade com os colegas é um fator predominante. o ambiente é agradavel e o trabalho é gratificante
good,Great Job Work/Life balance. Decent Compensations. Terrible Job Security/Advancement. And Last but not least HORRIBLE Management. This company is losing their identity. Identity Crisis in the making
good,This is your typical tech company. My position was in technical support for their produ The work was ok but I was looking to move up to supporting wireless equipment which I felt at the time had a good deal of growth opportunities. I was considering getting Cisco certifications done. Unfortunately I was working there as a contract employee and management was laying off a good number of people. Its an ok place to work for especially if you're getting your start but I'm not sure its worth sticking around for very long.
good,"no benefits offered to factory workers, short breaks , over the top goals to match repetitive and boring no medical, paid holidays or vacation time it was only a good place to work if you were a ""motorolan"" hired by motorola"
good,"Ela é media,apesar de ter vários benefícios ,pelo menos eu acho ue deveriam dar mais oportunidade a quem quer se desenvolver dentro da Empresa mesmo"
good,At the end it was all coming apart. General Instrument before Motorola bought them was a far better company.
good,"Going through some serious transformation from a HW company to a SW/Services company. Results in a lot of turmoil within the teams."
good,Ottima capacità di poter sviluppare in piena autonomia il proprio lavoro ma purtroppo in un ambiente pessimo dove solo chi diventa un yes man può sopravvivere
good,It is pretty ok environment to work with. Co-workers are nice.
good,Motorola was good place to work and people were nice. Sometimes it used to be typical day at a job.
good,Achieved excellent results during my time there. Great group of people to work with.
good,"Empresa de fácil trabalho, mais é cansativo e repetitivo. Aprendi vários tipos de montagens, ótimo convívio com colegas de trabalho."
good,"Empresa com treinamento mensal ,procura sempre qualificar os funcionários da melhor forma possível ."
good,Motorola is a great legacy company that has been heavily focused on Land Mobile Radio and is now transitioning to a software and service prover with a focus on mission-critical incident management. Great company culture. Benefits competitive. But slow-moving in general especially on the software and service side of the house.
good,"I worked their for over 28 years as an developmental engineer.  It was a good run but it got very stressful starting when they implemented ""Relative Performance Assessment"" (AKA ""Rand and Yank"") and went downhill after that.  People were too busy looking over their shoulders and sucking up to management to order to do their jobs to their fullest.  Instead of Motorola following their own management/business style they hired too many MBAs with undergraduate degrees in Paranormal Animal Psychology and had no engineering back ground.  The stake in the heart was when all engineering was outsourced to Poland and Korea.  I had to jump ship at that point.  So sad to leave in July of 2017 but I've heard many of my former co-workers were let go."
good,"The job was great up until this year. There have been a lot of structural changes and management doesn't know what it is doing. They promised pay increases for months now, but keep delaying it for whatever reason."
good,"Good old company with tons of nice people"
good,"Presented with technical challenges with decent support in accomplishing necessary goals. Overall, somwhat slow to react to transition or customer changes."
good,"If you wanted a family feeling in a manufacturing setting, this was the place to work.  Everyone worked together for the same goals and the company centered around its employees."
good,Evaluate and review daily issues.  Create project plans for process improvements.   Maintain  production line running with minimal downtime and interventions.
good,this is the definition of  what it means to have a starter job. This job is a good way to get your feet wet I this is your first job. You're going to learn a lot about the job and people.
good,"The job was not so hard for me in every day because my previous job was twice harder than it. I learned here to ship finished products to customers by using the computer. Building and wrap up new incoming finished goods into the pallets and move it to the bin by using the forklift, jack-lift. Same as picking into the bin to ship the finished goods to the costumers. I learned to inventory. the workplace was so clean, and everything are in proper arrangement. The benefits are good too."
good,started in keypunch dept in 1980. Just needed to know how to run a card punch machine and worked swing shift. But I was provided with a careerpath after 4 years. Started college for Computer Programming
good,"An internationally recognized thought leader, industry expert, and key speaker on a variety of topics including US CDMA/LTE, IoT, wireless, cloud enablement, FOTA, and technical strategy."
good,"Trabajé casi por dos años en su planta de Vega Baja PR y Chicago, Muy buena compañía para trabajar."
good,This is where I gained the majority of my technical skill-set to succeed in the wireless environment. I enjoyed being part of a company that at one time had a long legacy of being at the top of cutting-edge technology.
good,"This was the automotive industrial group in Buffalo, NY.  Fast paced, stressful, eventually move operations to Mexico.  The work was interesting, but relocating to Mexico was something I didn't want to do."
good,"Balance sheet engineering took over.  Top management is in harvest mode, ""returning value to shareholders"".  The company is not investing in itself (other than occasional acquisitions).  I fear for the first real downturn, as the strength of the company is nowhere near what it once was. The elective addition of debt and reduction of all assets (returning value via share buybacks, etc.) will prove to be a mistake."
good,"Motorola Industrial was a good start of professional life, right after Law school.  I was responsible for new products certification and R&D tax exemption deductibles."
good,"not applicable as i have been away from the company for too long."
good,"There was a cafeteria and nurse office on site, and the company medical benefits were outstanding. They offered a Moto University so you could gain certifications in process improvement and offerd tuition reimbursement. Unfortunately, the company tanked during the recession and we were laid off. Hence the 3 star rating."
good,"Empresa onde aprendi muito, foi o ponta pé inicial!"
good,I haven't worked at Motorola for 18 years - so my review will not be valuable - I'm not able to provide accurate information - I'm not sure this company is the same company I worked for
good,"My day to day position included the following:"
good,"Motorola Solutions puts out amazing products that span the communications spectrum, and focuses on providing high tier customers with solutions versus JUST a product. The only downside is the company culture, which is what any person would expect from a typical corporation. I would always recommend this company to any customers, but for anybody who wants to start a career here and climb the corporate ladder, be prepared to put the company first as they put their bottom line first. If you are prepared to do that, their are endless opportunities so long as play the game."
good,Empresa com grande visão no futuro para novas tecnologias
good,The title pretty much says it all. Only room for advancement if you go to Chicago and even then it isnt easy. It seems like there is a lot of people that are comfortable in their positions that dont want to leave.
good,Motorola is an exciting place to work that develops interesting consumer products. Great experience and highly recommended. Company has undergone a signficant change in corporate ownership.
good,Provide details about why you liked or disliked working at the company:                                            The best part of motorola was living in Austin.
good,well it is almost time to stop. i am still tired of doing this again and again. will i have the car and the horse is all i know it to be a good person
good,"Worked as temp secretary for 2-years, has changed to Continental Automotive and I'm not familiar with the present standards and policies. Really enjoyed working with Motorola staff for the 2-years I was there"
good,Environment is changing from a large company focus to a small company focus.  Shrinking employee base with more turn over.  Good benefits and good people.
good,Very good company to provide platform to engg. to learn many things about domain and focuses on process and basic requirement which requires lots of time to justify development.
good,"It was a decent place to work. The pay could've been better. It was a long drive for me, but it was my first job so it was ok. It was a assembly line but not to difficult. the days went by pretty good."
good,Dificuldades de progressão na carreira. Bom ambiente entre colegas
good,Started with Motorola as my first job in Switch operations. The self driven culture of Motorola motivated one to do challenge oneself and do more all the time.
good,"Programmed and sold radios for rural fire departments and the at the military bases in and around Norfolk.  Good job, a lot of freedom and met a lot of nice people."
good,moderate place to work. had to fill out paper requests in order to go to the doctor. The lord is the only shepard. thou shall see and hear the unbecoming .
good,"the jobs are easy to do and not a lot of heavy lifting, normal pace job, the work envirement is great and well organized. the work is easy to learn and not too complex."
good,Good place to work.  High technology industry with lots of moving parts. The people in the company are very knowledgeable and drive extremely hard. The high technology industry changes rapidly and you need to be able to adjust to the changes.
good,"While I genuinely enjoyed the team members that I worked with, I thought that leadership/management was awful. I was hired as a project manager but received no formal training or guidance from management as to what their expectations of me were. My manager was not technically savvy even though we were a Technical Solutions team. Instead our manager only cared about the financial aspect of the business and was quick to throw other team members under the bus whenever those financial goals were not met."
good,In this role I worked on a production line making mobile phone for Motorola. I worked in a assembling line production giving top quality in my performance.
good,"The job required long hours. It was just ok.  Nothing bad to say, nothing spectacular to say either.  Just a basic job at the time.  Management was nice, and co-workers helpful"
good,Great place to work and also great people. wish it paid more because thats the only reason i had to leave. Other than that i would say fill out an application.
good,"loved working in the fast paced work environment, hours were longer sometimes but the satisfaction of the work balanced out any issues I may have had with the long hours"
good,"Motorola Solutions Inc. is a company that is currently going through a lot of change. Over the last few years the company continues to downsize to focus on it's 2 way radio business. Although the company is going through many changes, it's showing improvement in growth potential."
good,"Everyone knows the sad story of Motorola.  They are operating as bare bones now and continuing to cut back.  The compensation is great and the people are sharp but not much room to advance with the cutbacks., etc."
good,"In my last role at Moto, I was in charge of a small group located in Sunnyvale. We were an ""experiment"" charged with developing jointly with Google three mobile phone models based on a new operating system called Android. It was the right path for a successful future, but unfortunately it was not fully supported by the company's chairman who believed that the value of Motorola was in its patent portfolio and proprietary technology.   "
good,"Company trying to reinvent itself.  However, there has been a constant drive to reduce staff especially in the US that has left a very poor sense of job security.  Currently trying to hire more, but offered benefits and company reputation is making it difficult."
good,Strong IT culture with strong leadership. Workspace is new and exciting and based in the heart of the west loop in Chicago. The office is very easy to get to.
good,"I proactively monitor connectivity to Network device in the large network environment."
good,Working in Motorola Solutions has been very fruitful in terms of learning a product development cycle including regulatory compliance and manufacturing concerns. But work life balance was very bad and always pulled in schedules.
good,The company has gone thru tremendous resizing and has streamlined to only a few product lines. Suggestion to anyone interested in joining the company is to try to work on the latest innovative products to have the greatest career potential in the company.
good,"Great company when I first started, then it slowly went downhill. Years of outsourcing, slashing jobs, and lost focus of what made Motorola great, innovation."
good,"Any Project naturally becomes superb learning,and same thing happens there,association with other team mates were given knowledge,positivity and willingness to move ahead."
good,"Pros"
good,"es un buen lugar para trabajar, tienen unas politicas de trabajo elevadas lo que te ayuda a ser mejor"
good,"The staff and the team over there is all bout doing their own thing, no one cares about the rest and no one thinks that a job with that magnitude should be completed as a team."
good,Good opportunity to work with a few decent people.  Typical work day can be very challenging and rewarding at the same time.  Management was extremely supportive and to their workers opinions.
good,Every job really depends largely on your manager and the people you work with.  Motorola Solutions is neither the best nor the worst place to work.  It is certainly good enough to check out if the job description matches what you want.
good,"I work very closely with my customers. They are the reason for the job and the enjoyment of the work."
good,"It was a nice company logn time ago, but they constantly have layoffs."
good,"Empresa boa para se trabalhar, ótimo salário."
good,"You will have a good work life balance here... Some interesting and cool ideas are going on here... However the market is harsh, I can only say good luck..."
good,"A empresa possui um ambiente de trabalho agradável, proporciona diversas formas de crescimento."
good,"Motorola is still a good place to work but nothing like it was in the past."
good,"Worked there for a few day, people were nice and there were a lot of things to do. There's not much more I can say about this from how short I worked here."
good,"Installed, repaired and issued out computers for state troopers.i got achieve alot of other experience with them like attaching pieces to all switch boards and what they controll."
good,"It has been too long for me to review this company. Obviously, I don't work there anymore, and had a reason to leave. Look, please understand that I have no thing good or bad to say about them. So please don't force me to"
good,"I left before Google acquired it.  It was ok, but what can you say about an 80 year old company?  After I left, the company was split and mobile devices was sold to Google. Then they turned around and sold it to Intel."
good,A typical work day I try not to stress and everything that I have opted to do becomes a success. I like to achieve what I have set up to do.I have a splendid personality and enjoy people.
good,"This field is left intentionally blank. Just trying to list a resume by completing the bare minimum in this field."
good,"empresa boa mas funciona aos sábados, domingos e feriados por se tratar de shopping center"
good,A typical day is packed with meetings leaving some time to manage and complete a multitude of tasks.  The most challenging part of the day is the work/life balance as a typical week goes over 50 hours but I do enjoy the challenges and changing environment as no two days are the same.
good,Motorola has good company culture to accept new employee on board . Good exposure to customer and accessible to resources .
good,os colegas de trabalham tentar a todo momento prejudicar seu trabalho para que você não seja promovido
good,Typical day was to drive around King county and find dead spots for the new digital system they were putting in. Employees where really nice.
good,Good process.  Fear of failure got them into trouble.  Did not figure out a strategy beyond delivering good hardware.  Did not hire strong software engineers.
good,MSI is a great company and is a market leader in the field of mission-critical communications. A global company located in 120 countries and doing business with international government agencies.   A very successful company that is driven by innovation and a delivery of high quality products and services that customers admire.
good,"Enjoyed my time working at Motorola.  They gave me opportunity but not as fast as I would have liked.  But overall, it was a good company."
good,"It was a good place to work.  The pay and benefits were really good.  Was able to do/learn other things when not busy with my own projects."
good,"Work is very busy and demanding. There is onsite fitness center, and group classes are very nice. "
good,"Fast paced enviroment"
good,Did not work for Motorola but system will not let me delete or correct this title caption.  During this period I worked for Verizon.
good,"this is an old elephant company.  so, do not expect anything chance soon.  young talent not appreciated.  anything new present a thread to older sr. people"
good,"Was FPGA engineer for three months. Had a pleasure to work on LTE project, my responsibility was a data path part. Have worked with Xilinx IP core generator. Used Verilog and Matlab for testing."
good,"There were some good products.but later on too many layoff and no any job security.  "
good,Cultura americana é o grande forte. Hoje a empresa tem foco em negócios com Governo.
good,"* a typical day at work - coding legal documents and filing them in law library.  Typed documents and used dictation."
good,"My overall experience with this company was really enjoyable. I learned how to use Microsoft Excel, Word, PowerPoint. The management team was always there to help. The co-works were awesome as well. The hardest part of the job was the location, it took me well over an hour each way. The most enjoyable part was dealing with customers for different parts of the United States."
good,"Enjoyed working at Motorola, but my plant closed.  Great co-workers and management.  A lost of cross training, diversified in different machinery and testing procedures."
good,I was exposed to cutting edge technology with exceptional precision and built for super endurance.  Very impressive technology.
good,The major learning was how to adjust from a small private held company which all activity was in one or two time zones to working in a global company with activity cross multiple time zones and how to manage the workload and direct reports which are in another country.
good,"VERY CHALLENGING, i like the fact that we could work on our own. i felt that is was very structured in the office. Very good atmosphere. Very good pay."
good,"Trabajo en Motorola hace 5 años, y como el primer dia, dando lo mejor, en busqueda constante de soluciones y metodos para mejorar la calidad del trabajo, cada dia como un desafio nuevo, en un ambiente de trabajo excelente."
good,Fast paced environment with so many compelling new mobile devices with new challenges to hit the market in such a short time.
good,"Employees are seen as a liability to the bottom Line. Management is for the most part, totally ""hands off"""
good,"At this time it feels like a company on it's way out, or preparing to be bought.  Too many rumors, and low morale ooze from too many corners, and for a person who is not as ""in the know"" as one should be, this is disastrous."
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,"Motorola once was a dominate company. Once was an excellent company to work for. In the last several years the Company has shrunk in size from 150,000 employees to now under 10,000. Upper Management focus is selling business and outsourcing key operations."
good,Motorola was re-aligning its product lines after the sale out to Google. No clear approach was a real breaker for me. India was not a priority for their business. I was tasked with educating the channels and solution providers on the new Wi-Fi product lines which were introduced after the take over of Symbol. Small team but hectic travelling across the northern and eastern part of the country.
good,"Unfortunately after 16 years with Motorola, the company is restructuring and refocusing in order to ""Simplify and Grow"".  I don't know what that means or where it will end up, but I do know that a lot of people are losing their jobs."
good,production driven putaway product preform cycle counts. I enjoy the warehouse environment
good,"It was so long ago that I worked here, that I barely remember anything except the enthusiasm of my coworkers. Since my working there, my department got sold to a separate company. I imagine that the rest of Motorola (which went down with the ship) didn't fair too well."
good,"I have to admit that this company had much better days, now is not the same seems restructure is kind of a day to day activity. "
good,Boa empresa para funcionários efetivos. Boas oportunidades de crescimento profissional.
good,placing parts in a box is hard work too because you have to do it at a fast pace i learned that you had to meet a quota daily and that management really was concerned only with meeting quota co-workers was fun depending on what line you was on the hardest part of the job was meeting quota the best part was going home
good,"I really enjoyed working for Motorola, but the semiconductor industry has its ups and downs.  A typical day was usually spent working with engineering to help them do their jobs more efficiently.  The co-workers were great."
good,Good stepping stone for my career while attending school. Flexible schedules and opportunity for bonus/compensations.
good,"Ambiente e cultura extremamente competitiva, nada amigável."
good,Good team.  Smart people with interesting team vision.  Surrounded by tough culture of Motorola.
good,Boa Empresa. Aprendi bastante principalmente na parte de qualidade dos telefones celulares.
good,"A typical work day was accomplishing your goals which meant you are on top of the ""A game"".   You learn quickly not to seek reward for a job well done because you are getting  learning experience. Management is a team on its own. Managers are  all over the place so you really have to work hard and wait years for advancement but remember it a learning experience. The co-work get a long well with each other.  the hardest part of the job is getting everyone on the same page. The enjoyable part is when everyone's on the same page work get accomplished.  I wont forget the "" hard workers"" that contribute time and effort to my success."
good,"Productive "
good,"Motorola provided a fast paced enviroment in product life cycle. The people are great to work with, friendly, courteous and respectful."
good,"Pleasant, but hectic and challenging work environment. Co-workers are generally helpful, if they aren't in crisis mode. Training is easy to get, but you have to take the initiative to find and request it.  This is a good place to develop new skills."
good,Motorola used to be a very big corporation and fun place to work before break up into pieces.
good,"Good work, life balance. Good encouragement to try out new ideas. In 5 five years at Motorola Solutions, I learnt a great deal programming in C/C++ in the Unix environment."
good,A day of work is easy and calm in the CCSI part. I have learned that paying attention to detail is important. I got the job through a temp service and the job is not long term and they have not hired anyone in the last 20 years. So do not plan of a long term and within a month of being there they will be strict on attendence and will fire anyone. There was no enjoyable part of my job. And it was so easy.
good,"There were no advancement opportunities at this organization.  Since, they broke away from Motorola the benefits were not as lucrative.  Motorola had a better work life balance policy for all individuals not just managers or senior level executives."
good,"Motorola is a large company. Large companies can provide generous advancement opportunities for motivated individuals. "
good,"really great place to work if through Motorola, if temp there is no guarantee of job after a certain amount of time"
good,"Empresa razoável  para trabalhar pelo motivo de não ter a estabilidade para os funcionários."
good,It was a hard days work. Long hours standing up was not pleasant
good,"It was pleasure to working with experienced people. The most enjoyable part of the job was having international interaction with peers and companies. The hardest part of the job was heavy work load. I gained so much experience on risk, credit management."
good,Good benefits and interesting projects to work on but not enough job security.
good,"Não tenho nada para reclamar, pois não tive problemas. "
good,"En début de journée, le team leader prépare la journée à accomplir (un certain nombre d'appareils à réparer). Chaque technicien répare sur son établis sous une ambiance de groupe et agréable. Le travail d'équipe est très important et c'est cela qui gère l'ambiance."
good,Too many management layers which creates more barriers than opprotunities.
good,"Oversaw production and execution of all food outlets. Supervised employees, reviews, inventory and product ordering"
good,"Empresa com otimo restaurante, cardapio muito bom, "
good,I use to enjoy my work place along with my work and all our team members are well co-operative and helpful.All our efforts were recognised by the management by awards and rewards to motivate us
good,Overall outdated tech with no cap expenditure for growth. This is why they are no longer a semiconductor manufacturer 
good,"Company is traditional big company organization, it offer traditional value and steady change of the process."
good,This company has had a history of layoffs and changing leadership but overall it is a pleasant experience to say that you have worked there.  The pay is pretty good and the work schedule is realistic (it was with the boss I had though I believe it is not much different with other managers).
good,"The work in interesting and rewarding, Management leaves a lot to be desired. Large company puts too many restrictions on the employees and stifles creativity."
good,Benefits are less and less
good,I worked in a small divsion off campus. I can't comment on Motorola overal.
good,very boring job. decent pay. not as challenging of a job. the work is extremely mundane.
good,"Worked as AP account for Motorola subsidiaries in Beijing (China), Singapore, South Korea"
good,"Chegar na empresa, checar todos os EPIS, passar o cartão ,fazer a leitura da digital para informarmos que estamos logados, ir pra linha trabalhar."
good,"Aprendi a trabalhar em uma halter que corta as placas do telefone celular ,aprendi a soldar pequenas peças.Os colegas eram todos muitos companheiros.logo no começo pra pegar o jeito de executar o trabalho,todoas as partes."
good,"Programmed phones, disassembled & reassembled phones, packaged phones."
good,"A empresa oferece um bom ambiente de trabalho, também oferece uma boa refeição."
good,"Great people, great benefits, loved working here, on site cafe and gym"
good,inspector of circuit boards and cell phones.
good,Delivering packages to over 50 clients. Shipping out all ups and fed-x packages and receiving packages. Getting all packages delivered in one day didn't allow me to take a lunch 3 to 4 day of the week.
good,Motorola still has many problems in terms of managers's hierarchy which has too many level.
good,Motorola as a whole as fallen tremendously. It was once a great place to work. It's employee population is about a third of what it used to be with the division sell offs and work force reductions. The moral is very low. Its not a good plce to work now.
good,Like to work hand in hand with other employees. People were great to work with
good,A day could go from testing software to testing hand held units to procurement or maintaining the test chamber.
good,"Dynamic company, bucking trends, knows where it's going and investing accordingly"
good,"Adquiri bons conhecimentos na area de produção e fabricação de celulares, mas a empresa dificilmente contrata efetivamento um temporario conm contrato temporario."
good,Management here is weak at best. I loved the independence I had but the misdirection from management needs improvement.
good,"The most important aspect of the daily routine is having opportunities to learn, understand, and then provide opportunities for improving the work being done."
good,The company was the leader in CPCI and VME platforms. Always was working with the latest technologies.
good,"Very nice large campus- motorola mobility, I'm not sure if they still have their mobility division anymore so I really cant say what it would be like working there now."
good,Good company to work for. On the cutting edge of wireless technology.
good,Both halves of the former Motorola are going in different directions. Solutions seems to be pretty healthy though layoffs are still happening.
good,"I was a onsite person for a customer, spend all of it in a office supporting them and field techs. Had to many bosses each telling me different things to do."
good,Company supports every employee for growth and earn more money but it takes too much time for it . Sometimes they gives you growth but not in your town and that is the problem.
good,"Productive, exciting and fun workplace at times. Daily scrum meetings and sprint planning. System Validation Testing • System Performance Testing • Software Testing • System Integration Implementation • System Staging / Demo • System Deployment / Migration • System Process Improvement • Quality Assurance • Network Architect • IT Infrastructure / Admin • LAN • WAN • IT Security • UL Standards • Scheduling • Team Leadership & Motivation."
good,"Fast-paced and always learning. Comfortable physical work environment, employees are interesting, friendly, and supportive.  No personal issues with fellow workers."
good,"No longer exists - this was absorbed into another part of Motorola"
good,"Good place to work, helpful team members, good culture, sometime overtime is required. Overall its a good company, good place to start your career and move up. opportunity for growth."
good,Company is Ok from the work and technology part of it. The salary and benefits are OK. Not much to expect from the work balance side and the Job-security part of it
good,En el area de ventas hay mucha oportunidad pues la marca es de las mejores a nivel mundial y cuenta con mucho apoyo de los jefes.
good,"trabalhei como temporária na empresa por 5 meses, conheci muito pouco, uma grande infra estrutura."
good,"nice and fun place to work where work/life balance is encouraged with a gym even onsite. But advancement is not easy depending on the job area; I believe it more depends on who you know than how good or bad your work is."
good,"A typical day is made up of 75% response to real time customer issues. The balance of 25% is project work related to process improvement. The company is shifting away from a products business to more of a services portfolio. With the learning curve associated to this transition, the hardest part of the job became the shifting goal line. Success is not always clearly defined up front and a wait and see what develops approach is leaned on to much. Having said that, the functional working people at MSI were the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Good management and company culture. Recently merged with NXP and now Broadcom. Lot to learn especially for new college grads, good workplace culture."
good,Business unit was sold and unit employees were terminated.  At the time the benefits and pay were good while advancement was limited.  Co-workers were great.
good,When at I was at Motorola there were lots of opportunities to learn new things. One could transfer between projects or departments to gain new skills and experiences.  Co-workers were great and we made many friends there.
good,Pace of environment in supply chain is very fast & furious.  Lower levels are given power to make decisions to become leaders.
good,"If you enjoy traveling to different cell phone provides (verizon, sprint, at&t) to train management and sales associates on phone functionality, this is the role for you. "
good,A company where i am lucky to get managers who guided me to become a leader. An average work life balance. Management is transparent on sharing information. Co-workers are helpful at all times.
good,"Travel was fun in the beginning, but began to wear on me after several years of being away from my family at home.  Great co-workers for the most part and always like to have a good during our All Hands Meetings."
good,I enjoyed working for Motorola. Its a good company to start your career in.Not a lot of opportunity for growth but definitely a place where you can learn.
good,"Come in clock in on the computer"
good,"weekends and holidays off, nice work environment, friendly co-workers and managment. Work is very repetitive and mind numbing. everyone starts as a contractor with no benefits. hard work does get noticed and they will grant more responsibility in response to your efforts but it comes with little or no reward since your locked into a pay rate as a contractor for 1 year, no opportunity to negotiate higher wage."
good,"It's the right place for somebody who is passionate about ""helping people in the moments that matter!"". With majority of Motorola Solutions' customers being the public safety market, the company definitely has the right mindset of keeping the customers first and creating innovative ways to define the next generation of public safety platform. Being a global company, it gives you the opportunity to work with different teams and external business partners across the globe. Cross-functional collaboration is encouraged within teams which helps you learn more. The onsite wellness center, MSI foundation, volunteering opportunities, and social gatherings makes it a fun place to work at!"
good,Good Learning experience. Work is demanding. Encouraging top management
good,"See previous review of Motorola. Though the brand took us further in the industry given how long the corp had been in business, the experience was oveshadowed by mismanagement and many lost their 401Ks, and retirements as a result of mis-managed finances of the company."
good,"Serviço mais suave, só aprendi fazer testes em placas, os superiores são bons, os colegas são bem unidos, não uma parte difícil, pois era serviço muito leve e a melhor parte era a amizade de todos."
good,Management was understanding and they had available overtime
good,"Um trabalho dentro de lojas de operadoras, onde eu atendia e indicava os aparelhos da motorola, aprendi muita coisa com pessoas bacanas e inteligentes e com facilidades em trabalha com equipe, a equipe muito unida e pagamentos com data certa para cair."
good,"worked 8 hours "
good,Empresa agradável de trabalhar porém em período de mudanças significativas.
good,Put stock away and pick orders for customers replinish orders pick work orders know the rf system.Lots of nice co-workers the hardest part of the jobs was that Motorola got bought out it was ten years with them.I enjoyed when we had christmas partys and other fun activaties.
good,"Trabalhava não só no pós vendas, mas também no atendimento ao cliente. Tiver relacionamentos estáveis com os clientes."
good,"O estágio era com um alto valor agregado, e o programa elaborado pela empresa era um dos melhores,"
good,"tranquilo de trabalhar ,montagem de celulares,a direcao e a gerencia muito distantes dos funcionarios,companheiros de trabalho que sabem trabalhar em equipe"
good,Good company but needs stabilization. I enjoyed the lunchroom and the ability to work from home. Travel and meeting other people in the industry is also good here.
good,"Typical big company environment, culture differs from department to department"
good,L 'ambiente lavorativo e buono ...I colleghi molto disponibili ci tornerei subito a lavorare per loro
good,"A typical day in the atmosphere consist of critical thinking, problem-solving and great customer service. I learned how to work and a unmonitored environment with the ability to Solve all issues without supervision of a lead on a manager. "
good,"Mucho que aprender, conocer y saber sobre los tipos de modelos, diseños, estilos y mas."
good,An Amazing organization but the Indian Management was not really good in my opinion. Work life balance is not really great and you may end up working late too often
good,"The hardest part of the job was the Stress and getting through all the layoffs."
good,Everyone did not pull they weight and there were a lot of favoritism.I did what I had to do .weekly and monthly reporting on the metrics on the non conforming material.Adapt with the lean six sigma methodology.
good,"buon ambiente, in continuo cambiamento."
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho, empresa organizada ritmo de trabalho dinâmico."
good,"Overtime often. Cafeteria and workout area. Very serious on attendance. Very serious on quality of product. Always offering clases on teamwork, etc. Cross-training and supervisors available."
good,"On a typical day, I would build a radio. This was neat because the radio got sent to places all over the world, and it's satisfying to know I was the one who put it together. I also worked in a different department where we would test the radio towers to ensure their quality. This was fun because I got to build very expensive, very heavy towers that were a part of a bigger picture. It made me feel like I had purpose. Also, it was good money for a college student on winter break."
good,"Motorola was a great company to work for but after a change in Mgmt and not reacting on the digital Market and staying with the Analog  market, the decline started."
good,"CEO does not focus on the company's best assets - its people."
good,"I really enjoyed my 34+ years at Motorola. Was one of the best employers for many years. After the founding family (Galvins) were forced out of the business the company has been outsourcing and downsizing. They have all but eliminated hardware engineering with the intention to have outsourced companies design and build future products under the Motorola name. Company has gone from 168,000 employees to 10,000 in just a few years. The CEO is only concerned about the short term stock price. His only solution to propping up his numbers is to layoff people and sell all the property. No R&D in place"
good,"It was a great place to work. They had a credit union inside, store, nurse, and a cafeteria. It was really sad to see them shut down."
good,This company is fun to work for and there is a lot of opportunity to grow.  The hardest part of the job is learning the product as well as procedures.
good,"I worked at Motorola for 20 years in various positions and locations  in the US. The company does many things does many things right and provide a work environment that is respectful and not a lot of drama."
good,Good Management and benefits. Excellent experience and opportunities to grow up
good,uma empresa muito boa pra trabalha é bastante corrido. La é fabrica celulares de todos os tipos
good,"Todos os dias são corridos pois tem muita produção ."
good,"empresa correta com horários e metas a cumprir ,dando possibilidades de crescimento dependendo da motivação e dedicação do funcionário."
good,"Comprometimento com o funcionário,pagamento e benefícios sempre em dia e atingindo metas premiações extra.Incentivo ao funcionário."
good,"Os empregados da empresa são em sua maioria responsáveis de bons de se trabalhar mas a gerencia da empresa não é boa, o que levou a empresa de uma produção de quase 3 milhões de unidades há 6 anos atrás para pouco mais de 300 mil no período atual excelente"
good,Empresa com bom ambiente de trabalho onde os funcionários podem opinar e sugerir melhorias. Não são forçados a realização de horas extras e possui um ótimo restaurante e suporte médico.
good,The company did have a good work/life balance in place before being bought by Google. That will change and remains to be seen how that will impact the company moving forward.
good,Calm environment over all. Enjoyable to work for. Co worker are nice work flow is steady but not overbearing. And they a flexible as far as time off and handling personal business outside of work.
good,Motorola Mobility at San Diego
good,"I loved Motorola as an employer. There were so many great talented people I worked with in this company. The company has the culture and in its blood spirit for innovation, and deliver to the market the best of the best. However, with that, sometimes, the perfectionism hindered the company's ability to deliver solid financial results. I wish for the best for all the people still at Motorola to be landing in good positions after the merger with Google is done."
good,"Bom por eu ter trabalhado em tercerizada lá não era muito bom o salario mas tirando isto foi meu primeiro emprego gostei muito aprendi bastante coisas como por exemplo a demontar o aparelho celular e a embalar para mandar para outro pais as etiquetas tinhao que esta corretas se não iria dar erro. A gerencia era mais ou menos boa mais te dava a atenção, meus colegas de trabalho eram nota dez a parte mais difilcil era etiquetar as caixas e a mais agradavel era quando não havia erro"
good,"Motorola Solutions in Birmingham was a start-up that was acquired around 2014. The culture is stable, but the product worked on and supported in that office is a legacy product that is not being aggressively grown.  That limits the opportunities for career growth within the local office."
good,"Pros: Extremely talented individuals who can great coaches  for new hires. Complex ,Challenging projects make it a great learning experience. Cons: very few growth opportunities , frequent reorgs"
good,"Aprendi muito, pois uma empresa multinacional americana proporciona ética profissional, processo integrado, estruturação, automatização, comunicação interdepartamental, qualidade de vida para os funcionários, era corrido devido auxilio de produção, aprendi trabalhar em equipe e comunicação, ambiente de trabalho tranquilo, a parte mais difícil  era o horário noturno, pois fazíamos 12 horas."
good,"Strict time lines. was always pushed for more production."
good,"Worked towards a numbers goal every day while maintaining quality."
good,They have no more facilities left in the Dallas/Fort Worth area; this also includes the employee credit union. I think Houston is the last remaining facility.
good,"The company itself was good to work for, but my immediate manage was complacent. As a new employee I think I trained for one or two days, without much explanation of what to do."
good,"Was a good place to work, learn and grow with good people to work with, but in many positions work life balance is not so good. Company is shrinking and there are always concerns of layoffs."
good,"Motorola solutions has a great history of 80+ years in business. In more recent times it has shrunk from having over 150,000 employees globally to having less than 40,000; and it is still waning. It is not clear if or when the decrease would stop."
good,"Overall rating*                                       3"
good,"As everyone knows, technology companies need to be constantly on the cutting edge of technology or they are ran over by the competition. Those who sell consumer goods even have to be on top of customer trends ans perceptions otherwise they will miss the boat. And unfortunately that's what happened"
good,"Motorola was huge.  Alot of facilities.  So, depeding on which location you worked.  For me, Bothell, WA and Champaign, IL are the ones stuck in my mind.  Smart and good people.  Great working environments (for both work and life).  Picnic and team building activities were very often.  Soccer, tag-football, pingpong table, fooball table, free popcorns,...Best time of my career."
good,"The company suffered from too many managers and not enough engineers and technicians. It was a top-heavy company that was destined to be broken up into smaller, more manageable divisions with their own unique goals."
good,"As a business analyst you can expect to travel 75-80% of the time, typically flying out of your home base on Monday mornings and returning Friday afternoons.  I would not recommend this position for an individual with a family with kids as being away week after week becomes stressful for the entire family. The benefits of having a career where one gets to travel is you get to see parts of the country you probably would have never experienced before, you also get to try amazing food."
good,busy very routine every day very friendly people nice bosses
good,"This was a fun position for me & company the only problem was they took for ever to hire me permanent after being there 3yr., as a temp, I finally got a better job offer at ATC Logistics as a direct hire so I quit Motorola, but they do teach you and offer you and train you to move up within the company, because I went from assembly line worker to quality Dept., Inspector to doing FAI's ( First Article Inspections) having my own computer desk & equipment."
good,I learned so much here. It was a role I could use as a stepping stone into the business.
good,"- Conseguia desenvolver minhas atividades de forma tranquila, tínhamos cronogramas e planejamento ."
good,Less micro-managing. More of getting a lot of work done with flexibility. Worst part of the job is the commute and uncertainty. Best part of the job is the people in which I interact with on a daily basis.
good,"Ótima empresa para trabalhar,salário compativel com a função,aprendi a importancia do trabalho em equipe e como ele funciona bem em relaçao a qualidade.Os colegas eram super profissionais,sabiam fazer as pessoas se sentirem a vontade já que rolava muito rotatividade,a parte mais dificil da empresa era a falta de estabilidade já que nunca efetivavam ninguem,a parte mais agradavel era o trabalho em si."
good,"montagem de celulares e radios , aprendia o trabalho em equipe ,meus superiores sempre tive uma boa convivencia, fiz grandes amigos, somente os problemas com alimentação, um lugar tranquilo"
good,Motorola is a good company to work for. However the management style is very inefficient.
good,"Great place to work, co-workers are really nice, the hardest part of the job, try to make any change, as and old company is really difficult to introduce new concepts."
good,"I liked Mot alot great people to work with hours good "
good,"Plenty of different things to learn at a daily basis, busy. New incoming co-workers every quarter."

good,"Aprendi a trabalha em uma linha produção pois foi meu primeiro emprega na produção, a gerência sempre te da assistência. A parte mais difícil era quando a produção caia e com isso havia muito corte e a parte mais agradável era quando chegava o final do expediente e voçê via que conseguiu cumpri com a meta do dia."
good,Built an excellent team of Technical IT recruiters and resources by identifying the learning potential of the candidates and hired the mix of experienced recruiters as well as fresher’s.
good,My time at Motorola was short due to the hiring freeze.  I would have loved to continued to work there and curious what would have been.  I'm glad everything happened the way it did.  I enjoy my current job.
good,"Motorola ""was"" one of the greatest companies in the United States.  I worked there over two separate engagements, the first for 5 years, the next for a little over a year."
good,"As a quality analyst you must understand that it is your job to be, what George Orwell described as, the ""though police"". You grade and monitor every agent on the account you have been assigned. You listen their phone calls while watching what they do on their computers. Like a voyeuristic stalker you stalk agents to find the littlest thing they do wrong."
good,"Empresa boa, porém com uma grande mudança de funcionários, dificultando a aprendizagem e excelência na execução dos processos"
good,"DO MORE WITH LESS is the mantra here at Motorola Solutions."
good,Motorola Solutions is showcases a collaborative and open environment.  They pride themselves on a young up and coming workforce. Great benefits package.
good,"Started out as temp. Hired full time in accounts receivable dept, balancing 1million dollars a day.  Was fast paced and could be stressful if dept didn't balance the books.  Was promoted within a year to supervisor of dept, but had new management come in with no experience which ended up my responsibility with more hours, etc.  Never got my title for promotion and never got my pay grade for jumping 5 job grades, so took a leave of absence and found a different job."
good,"empresa no ramo muito significativo, e competitivo, boa pra se trabalhar."
good,"Progressive place to work over the years.  Recently, the company is more focused on the core business and innovating in the public safety space."

good,"The company has allowed staff to have automony in work and flexibility in our working hours. There were career opportunities to move within different job functions within the divisions. "

good,"Uma empresa grande, muito dinâmica e organizada, tive a oportunidade de aprender muito na área de produção, os supervisores são muitos acolhedores os colegas de trabalho fica para toda a vida."
good,Motorola Solutions is a nice place to work if you are looking for a steady job with known expectations. The biggest problem with Motorola Solutions is the lack of opportunity for advancement and below average compensation.
good,A typical day at work was fast paced and multi-task intensive. I have learned to work with various cross-functional teams to provide solutions to customer needs all over the world.. The workplace culture is diverse and positive. The hardest part of the job is work life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job is engaging with customers and providing quality customer service and solutions.
good,"Almost 3 decades worth of dedicated effort because of the enjoyable place to work.  I have been spoiled to be involved in one of the most highly respected, technical leaders in the industry."
good,Company is far behind in technology. It is surviving because of its large customer base but even that is declining. Find another company unless you work cheap overseas.
good,Work is steady but there is no room for moving up into management. The employees don't look out for you. It's a fight to keep your head above water. Higher management is so so but working with lower employees is stressful and horrid.
good,"A put your head down and work kind of job.  Coordinate the efforts of many SMEs into a consistent written and visual sales proposal.  Light travel required, mostly for training and annual meeting."
good,It was a great place to work before they closed the plant down and moved our jobs to Mexico. A lot of good people lost their jobs so the executives could pad their wallets by moving our jobs to Mexico.
good,"Continuous workforce reductions deteriating work environment; a good place to be from, not much by way of  future for new hires. Maybe a short term place to get started."
good,Its a nice place to work but there is little or no advancement.  Hard to get a raise.  Most employee's there have been there forever so that's a plus but if you are new you most likely wont be heard out for anything no matter if you are wrong or right.
good,Interesting fast paced work environment.   Management was a little old school and not great with the soft skills.  Learned lots and enjoyed the work and people
good,"I loved working for Motorola Inc. Our workplace was a very positive one and the employees I worked with were a great team. Our department moved its operations to Mexico, thus we lost our employment. Overall I loved it there."

good,"O dia de trabalho era normal com necessidade da execução da função que exercia, corrido devido a produção de celulares. A gerencia não criava expectativa uma vez que o serviço era temporário e a empresa não criava vaga efetiva, o ambiente de trabalho era limpo."
good,"Empresa muy dinámica, constante aprendizaje y resolución de problemas, siempre en búsqueda de innovar en todos sentidos para alcanzar metas,"
good,"Good job after college. Dispatch center is good for people who love people. If you are not a fast paced learner than this position is not for you."

good,"comunicarse con direccion para reportar entrada al trabajo,"
good,"It was a good company to work for, however it began laying off division workers for cutback cost"
good,Working for MSI is a rewarding career.  Generally goals are set by management and we are able to pursue them with little over the shoulder review.  Lot's of responsibility and results of the work helps overall Public Safety.
good,The culture is one that people are always looking over their shoulder waiting for the next round of layoffs. Some supervisors and managers  are very poor people managers and let poor performers remain.
good,It is a jump right in kind of organization with little to no direction. You spend most of the time using Google to find the answer. There is a lot of jargon used so be sure to write it down and ask questions later.
good,"Opportunity to learn and explore many new things. Good place to work."
good,"Was with Motorola for 30 years.  Was offered many opportunities for movement and advancement.  Recently, have refocused on primarily selling to public safety agencies."

good,"Personal joven, buen ambiente laboral, el trabajo consistía en hacer un test de comprobación a los terminales para su posterior salida al mercado."
good,Typical work was very stingy. I was never happy to go to work there. Atmosphere is to pass time and never to give productive output. TOo much burearocracy. This was the reason inspired me to move to Qualcomm.
good,"Always provide training for new hiring. It provided both technical and management training for certain hours per year."
good,I believe the teams and departments that I use to be part off and  I work in have been closed down/disbanded/made redundant shortly after I left  and therefore any comments here would be irrelevant.

good,"I enjoyed my time at Motorola, I grow and learned a lot. It a relaxing environment, you just have to get your work done. Big on continuous learning. Layoffs hurt work culture for sure."
good,There is not a lot I can say about Motorola. It was a long time ago that I worked there. I enjoyed my time there and worked with some great people and made some good friends. But the company I worked for is different than what I was in. I was in semiconductors back then. I do not think Motorola does that anymore.
good,"I am 66 and retired from Motorola at 64, work 34 hrs one week and 46 the next, alternating weeks, enjoyed"

good,It was a very positive experience for me as a professional and overall company consisted with hard working teams. Gained excellent software development skills
good,"Creates wonderful technology advanced products for the public, but provides only basic tools to employees. Crowded HQ but work at home is possible depending on position. Friendly co-workers and environment."

good,Late night phone calls.  International company. Diverse workforce. Annual picnic.  Workers like to help one another.  Management very demanding to items done in time.
good,"The company has been through some dramatic reorganizations, many people are coming and leaving the company. Managements seem to have the need to be strengthened and culture to be reevaluated. Benefits are good but little room for growth."

good,"Plano de cargo e carreira para efetivos."
good,"Motorola's Senior leadership team at this time is trying to reinvent the company.  Struggling to find their way and constantly reducing staff.  Reduced down to 1 product and 1 customer more than likely preparing for a sell off.  10 years ago, there was no better company to work for in terms of compensation, family life balance and really appreciating its employees.  Making change for the sake of making change, and not really having good direction.  I hope they finally find their way before its to late.  I would love to join the team again, but not under these conditions."
good,"There are advantages and disadvantages working at large companies, Salary is OK, Opportunists and growth are OK as well. Good work life balance."
good,"I started building widgets on the factory floor for Motorola at the start of my career. I learned a lot about how Products were manufactured and as I transitioned to Technical Operations, how the data was managed to facilitate their Design and Manufacturability. In the 20+ years I became an expert in Product Data Management activities and tools. Every step of the way I proved that I can handle whatever was thrown my way and I could not have done it without all those managers who mentored me along the way. The only reason I left was due to my connection to the Motorola business that was acquired by another company. Otherwise, I would of finished out my career there until retirement if allowed to."
good,Customer needs change priorities.  Dealing with demanding customers in Public Safety Market.  Mission Critical issues and situations that require immediate attention to detail and resolution
good,A rewarding company to work for.  Continuous change with customer satisfaction as the number one goal.  Will always take the extra step to satisfy the customer.

good,it is a friendly environment to work in where everyone cooperates really well.  It has really nice work life balance in working remote and etc
good,Motorola  is a very slow paced kind of job. It gets really intense at times but the staff and management helps you get through the day. I felt as if i was one of their own.

good,"great company but it does have its leadership issues."
good,"Every morning we had a team meeting. This was great because we got to clear up yesterday's problems, or any miscommunication. During this time we also were able to give our input, i learn this was key because it allowed us to assembly phones fast once listening to everyone's ideas.My management and Co-workers were one in the same because when we needed management to pitch in with our work, they didn't hesitate.The hardest part of my job at Moto was watching them move to Chicago,IL. The most enjoyable was creating those phones"

good,"It used to be a nice start to the day, a friendly atmosphere to enter and get going for the rest of the day. Major and minor task each day, the working environment would make you comfortable to work and share knowledge with your colleagues. It taught me the management skills, the initiative to think differently and conclusively. It gave me a chance to express my skills and pass my knowledge to others and absorb knowledge from them. The co-workers were friendly and helpful. The door to the manager's office was always open to discuss things professionally with him. The hardest part of the job was the irregular routine of a field engineer where time really did not matter, and i think that was the most enjoyable part of the job as well as i adjusted myself to different tasks at different situations and learned alot at that time."
good,"Motorola is a great place to work that is rich in innovation. However, if you are in a group that does not innovate, it is very difficult to move groups."

good,"My typical week consists of 4 day travel to my territory and 1 day for paperwork.  I usually travel 3 weeks and 1 week home office.   The most enjoyable part of my job was providing sales and product training and going on sales calls with my resellers.  I learned how to simplify our training materials to where my resellers can utilize it in their daily sales calls.  I have also learned to work with very diverse groups of people and several vertical markets in both commercial and government accounts.  I have sharpened my skills in relationship building and listening skills.  The hardest part of my job is to schedule training, ride alongs and sales calls with my resellers in a short window of time in a specific geographic area.  My home office was in Chicago and i handled 13 states in the western part of the country.  The managers I had with Motorola were the best.  They support and encourage creative and free thinking in territory management."
good,"Hours: 8:30-5"
good,I learned a lot about troubleshooting and Diagnosing issues with certain devices a typical day at work is the shifts would go by fast due to the fast paced work I did there

good,"The company is in mobile device business, which is a very competitive industry. The company produces quality products and I am proud to contribute to the developing of its leading products."
good,At the time Motorola was very confused with how to handle Nokia.  It was in the middle of shutting down several factories and downsizing its manufacturing foot print.
good,"Cooperative co-workers with emphasis on training and development."
good,"Chegar ao posto de trabalho e faze-los com a maior atenção possivel."
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, carga horária e remuneração satisfatórios. Aprendi a lidar melhor com o público em geral. A parte mais desagradável era ter que remover material da concorrência, que muitas vezes eram conhecidos ou amigos, porém era minha função. A parte mais agradável eram as reuniões e confraternizações que tínhamos, e passar conhecimento para outras pessoas também é muito bom!"
good,"como tecnico, laborar ahí es muy bueno, hay capacitacion, buen ambiente laboral, buena comida, las prestaciones son demasiado buenas, hay mucha cultura hacia el mejoramiento continuo, actividades deportivas"
good,Nesta empresa consegui crescer profissionalmente e apender novas tecnologias e métodos de trabalho.

good,analyzing/troubleshooting cellular phones associated hardware & software.
good,Tested all Motorola devices ensuring workability
good,"I worked with Motorola, previously Symbol for 10 years. I started as an AP clerk and worked my way up to Accounts Payable Supervisor. I learned all about SAP, Outlook, and IXOS while working with Motorola. Our direct Managers were a pleasure to work for and kept us well informed of changes. My co-workers and I had become a family since we had been together so long. The hardest part of the job was when we had to transition our department overseas. We spent a year training our overseas counterparts as well as preparing for a transition from SAP to Oracle. The people I have come to know as family were the most enjoyable part of my job. As well as some of my vendors that I worked with for so many years. I still keep in touch with both."
good,Midwest technology company that was purchased by Nokia Siemens
good,"Started as assembler, promoted to shipping. All was ok but the management was distant. We were not close to office personnel. Liked working in shipping."
good,"I thought Motorola would be the company I retire from. There were a lot of opportunities to move around, try different jobs (within scope)."
good,Ambiente de trabajo a veces estresante por el rol de clientes todo lo demas muy bien
good,Demonstrated capacity to protect and create value through oversight and management of risk.  Strategic and operational focus spanning all aspects of the business/ project.  Communications and reports focus discuss and enhance decision making.  Advocate of risk assurance - ensuring key controls are: fit for purpose; deployed; and consistently applied.
good,It’s a good job but could use better pay and better management  and more training with better trainers.It could always use more hiring to the good hardworking temporary people instead of what the do now which is work them until they don’t need them anymore  then call them back  when they do need them again if they where good but it’s no telling how long they wait in between
good,"Buenas prestaciones ,  excelente cultura de trabajo , gano premio nacional de calidad de Manufactura."
good,"The day-to-day for my part looked pretty much the same though challenging. People are trained to do a variety of tasks with only limited background knowledge required in the tasks from earlier employment. "
good,Diversity valued.  Good employee work life balance.  Many opportunities to move around and take on different roles.  Technically talented engineers.  R&D efforts well supported and funded.
good,Strong mix of experienced and inexperienced talent. Plenty of work to go around. Everyone marches to the same beat. Could use more emphasis on personal career growth.
good,"When I worked there it was the best job for me at the time. One draw back is the long days, though, You worked a 4/3 shift so it could get a little long, But you had every other weekend off and days during the week. Overtime was not mandatory however it was plentiful and you could work if you wanted. There was also OT in the distribution center if there weren't opportunities in your department. Overall it was a good place to work, Too bad they decided to move the plant."
good,"Motorola Solutions is one of the best company if you want to learn about telecommunication in a real deep from RF to Core. "
good,Productive work environment and fast-paced.  Significant progress expected in accelerated timelines.   Employee turnover paradoxically high given the growth and success of the business.
good,one of the better but not great. the company downsized a lot and many people lost their job a few years back. never was the same. not too sure about the job culture now but i know that it isn't as good as it use to be years back.
good,"Mi experiencia en Motorola Solutions fue muy positiva, fui contratada desde un principio como Team Leader, mi región específica de trabajo era el mercado brasilero y como team de LATAM. Me enviaron a San Pablo a una capacitación y a conocer a mis compañeros y esa instancia fue sumamente positiva para el desempeño de mis tareas. "
good,"Considered one of the world's technological giants, Motorola is a good place to start and grow a career in electronics! With its diverse products in communications, information technology,electronics,etc.it has become in itself an industry standard to look up to!"
good,"Trabalhei por 13 meses, aprendi muito sobre o funcionamento do almoxarifado. O trabalho era bem corrido, pois tínhamos que atender á linha de produção. Mas o ambiente de trabalho era muito bom, o relacionamento com os demais funcionários eram muito próximos. Tínhamos várias reuniões com o gerente, para atualizar as metas da Companhia. As dificuldades que encontrávamos era a rapidez ao atendimento á linha de produção!"
good,What makes a great job are great colleagues and manager.  I was fortunate to have both at Motorola and very much enjoyed my job.  I was fortunate to work on exciting high tier products ensuring successful launches.
good,Worked in manufacturing facility and built printed circuit boards to build cell sites for cellular companies. Worked from the start of the line from preparing a bare circuit board to finished product.

good,"Alto turnover mas bons prêmios, um ambiente de trabalho competitivo."

good,"Motorola is a company devoted to engineering prowess.  With divestitures of various parts of the organization in the recent and not so recent years, the focus, goals and management have been regularly shifting."
good,"Designed a power chip: TLV431."
good,In addition to providing my family the opportunity to relocate to the beautiful state of Colorado the most advantageous benefit of Motorola Solutions is the work life balance
good,There are good moments working in Motorola where recongnition is duly given. Professionalism is often seen and behaved. The downside is the inconsistency of the company mission but that is very likely to be driven by business demand.
good,"The job that I did was a ""turn key"" operation, I analyzed and repaired cellular phones. At that time there was a high demand for cell phones and the team worked through weekends. Soon after the manufacturing and repair of the cell phoned was sent overseas"
good,"Great place to work. Good benefits and work life balance."
good,I retired because they wanted me to start working a 12 hour shift. Which is 3 days on 4 off one week and 4 on and 3 off the next. Very hard to raise  children as a single parent working these hours.
good,"A typical day at work was very stressful, I stressful that I thought I was used to working in. There was always back stabbing, talking about each others back bu no one do or say anything about it"
good,"ótima empresa, ambiente e pessoas agradáveis, empresa memorável"
good,Company is driven for training. Company relocating was not an avenue I could explore at the time. They did offer to assist with relocation. Considerate of all employees needs.
good,I believe the department I was in is currently non-existent as it was. The benefits are great if you like working for a huge company like Motorola. During the period I was there I was constantly worried about layoffs. They did several rounds. It made the culture of the office difficult
good,"This position involved coordinating material from Subject Matter Experts into a proposal with a relatively consistent voice that also conformed to house style. "
good,"Did not take advance on leadership of Microprocessors and wireless technologies."
good,"Still a good company, but no longer a great company to work for. Job security and advancement is very low. They do allow flexible work hours and location."

good,"Motorola is great place to work with very friendly and highly educated people and the managers are happy to help if required , Overall I've enjoyed my time at MOTO"
good,"I learned how to deal with customer service,attitude,and patience.Nevertheless,i was a leader and paid attention to detail and cared about everybody else on the job and what they were goinh through.And i learned to work as a team player.More hands the lighter the work."
good,Poderia dar mais oportunidades para o funcionário desenvolver o trabalho para melhor reconhecimento.
good,"Enjoyed my years at MSI, worked with a lot of great, knowledgeable people.  Had an opportunity to work on a number of different technologies and applications."
good,"Nos anos que trabalho nesta empresa, aprendi muito sobre gestão de colaboradores, funcionamento de servidores, energia elétrica e como desenvolver um trabalho com excelência."
good,"You are standing on your feet all day. They will move you around to different station, to learn different tasks. Co-workers are friendly. Its a job, but the hardest part is standing for a long period of time everything else is learn-able."
good,"Aprendi muito, aprendi a lidar com os clientes, saber sua necessidade, saber resolver. Tive muitos e bons treinamentos, isso me ajudou bastante. Gosto muito de mexer com o público, pra mim foi muito boa experiência."
good,"Trabalhar na Motorola me proporcionou um aprendizado mais aprofundado em minha área de reparo, com muitos desafios, tendo a oportunidade por diversas vezes de colocar em prática todo o meu conhecimento adiquirido antes e durante da minha vida profissional."

good,"Motorola has been a great company to work for and has high quality technology with a strong focus on it's customers.  Unfortunately, the company has lost its direction and has no loyalty to its valuable employees."
good,"montagem e desmontagem de aparelhos celulares e tablets."

good,"Pros"
good,"Call Centers are particularly very technical in order to satisfy the customer expectations.The Typical day working at a call center begins to settle down for the night and taking calls and and respond to emails follow up customer calls where necessary and document all call information according to standard operating procedures. We’ve worked hard on designing our measures and sore cards making sure that we hit our goals and ensure customer satisfactions are being met."
good,como todo primeiro emprego tudo é novo eu estava ansiosa pra começar e aprender pena q durou só 90 dias mais foi a melhor oportunidade de emprego da qual aprendi muito
good,"I enjoyed working at Motorola. I traveled a good bit, which kept it from becoming to monotonous. The position put me in contact with the customer (Wal Mart) and I was able to build great relationships and network. The office did lack some structure that made it hard to escalate issues when needed."
good,"A great experience, once a Telecom Giant, unfortunately time has not been kind to the organization. Hopefully they can rebound."
good,"Dias corridos e bem quentes."
good,"First of all, I was merely under contract to Motorola but it was a job and workplace I really enjoyed. My direct manager was a very considerate and understanding person and the people I worked with were generally young and pretty cool. I enjoyed my responsibilities and felt as though I was making a creative difference. My only real caveat was that I often felt a lack of focus from the management -but this was no doubt a reflection of the times: the iPhone had recently been introduced and it was painfully obvious that Motorola was going to be playing catch-up for some time. We just had nothing even in the development stage that could compete. Unfortunately, this eventually resulted in a massive restructuring effort in which most of my colleagues and I were let go. Very sad situation as I worked with a highly intelligent and creative international team."
good,"Trabalho com uma super equipe, bom relacionamento nas lojas visitas da empresa para prestar serviço de consultoria."
good,Motorola group has been spun off an most if not all the people there are no longer Motorola employees.  Sad story for such a great company.
good,"Develop and implement the Corporate Communications Plan, designed to build a positive perception of Motorola as a leading technology company, to protect the company’s reputation and resources and to support its business objetives. Maintain a contructive relationship with the company’s key stakeholders, such as journalists, industry analysts, business chambers, embassies, public officials and non-profit organizations. Develop the strategic planning and lead of high-impact Thought-Leadership Campaigns, geared mainly towards promoting products and technologies among prospective customers and other key audicences, for the different business units."
good,"Fascinating colleagues. We are working as a team to achieve the target. Comparing and competing with one another in a professional way."
good,"Motorola is a telecommunications equipment based company where many technology based work also finds a corner. Webpages , dashboards, reports are created to describe the number of mobile sold allover the globe. I created dashboards on Tableau. Worked on SQL to fetch data from provider."
good,"The location, facilities and the way Motorola treated their employees was great.  I liked working there."
good,"Overall Motorola was a nice place to work. However, things started going bad after 2000 with confusing company strategy and direction. Atleast, one or two rounds of lay offs were common."
good,"Very Good"
good,"Trained on Codex X.25 devices."
good,"A typical day could involve assessing start up projects for training and documentation support and the budgetary/staffing requirements.  Created/reviewed project plans, schedules, and progress of work to the scope.  Working directly with associates in their development and career growth.  Managing the department budget, goals, and performance."
good,"I loved every aspect of my job on a daily basis. I was blessed with the opportunity to grow marketshare in the South East Territory by building relationships with Executive Leadership and identifying training opportunities to train and educate on Motorola Products. Direct Leadership within Motorola was supportive, empowering and a pleasure to work for."
good,"Really enjoyed working for the CPE group and Motorola for 12 years. Unfortunately, MOTO decided to reorg certain groups and many talented people were let go."
good,"Exciting, fun, fast paced, focused, awesome systems capabilities."
good,"work without micro management"
good,Não tenho nada a valiar eu tenho o que tenho graça a motorola la eles me ajudaram a ter uma experiencia em produção de conhecer um pouco da montagem de celular para a gente encher o motivo que o celulares são caro pois a gente rala muito para entregar para o cliente o melhor celular
good,"1)Exciting day to day challenges"
good,I was a temporary laborer but the supervisor promoted me in just 2 weeks on the job to crew leader. I loved the various aspects of my job. I have to stay busy and enjoyed working with the Motorola co-workers.
good,"good experience company to have worked for, gained lots of experience. pay was not enough for me unfortunately."
good,"A great place to work and make friends. A great culture and excellent work ethics. A lot of talented people work here, which kind of make it hard to shine through, it would take a lot of determinations and dedication to advance in career here."
good,Era uma otima empresa de se trabalhar agradavél otima convivencia com os colegas de trabalho aprendi muito .
good,"excelente empresa, muy buenas prestaciones de trabajo."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the people.  It's a fun place to work.  The work is very demanding and quite challenging.  Most of management is approachable and there to mentor.  I learned a great deal from this organization that provided me with greater knowledge in my field of expertise.
good,Entered on ground floor of distribution activities.  Services and deliverables grew dramatically every year.  Responsibilities grew with each evolution of facility.
good,Learned the new technologies on the job and applied in the Project.
good,"Uma empresa muito boa de trabalhar porém com poucas oportunidades de efetivação de mão de obra,supervisão e colegas de trabalhos sempre prontos para auxiliar no que  fosse preciso,havia da parte da supervisão uma grande preocupação com o bem estar dos funcionários tendo assim alguns minutos de exercícios fisícos durante o trabalho e também o revezamento nas tarefas execultadas."
good,"Motorola Solutions seems to be a fairly standard established company, in contrast to a startup type of company. There are few company picnics, no free coffee or cookies, or that type of benefit. However, there is very good job security and a moderately good work/life balance. The work at Motorola Solutions is primarily focused on Government and Public Safety. The product technology is not on the bleeding edge and there is very low turnover, which means that the opportunities for advancement are limited, especially if you are not in the corporate headquarters in Schaumburg, IL. The people are very nice to work with. Management is fairly typical in that they try to control cost, avoid risk and be predictably consistent on product and feature launches."
good,Management was terrible. Technician knowledge was excellent. Working 12 hour shifts really does not work.
good,1. Research and Development
good,good company but slow to change.
good,"Era satisfatório trabalhar, muito agradável, era um serviço bem sossegado e com pouca cobranças."
good,busy but limited opportunity to move between technical areas of competence.
good,"O onibus pegava na esquina de casa, sempre conversamos e batiamos nossas metas sem ninguem precisar ficar cobranco."
good,This was a great job for advancement and learning. I worked with great people and my management took good care of us. The pay was pretty low but served as a stepping stone for me to a better position in another company.
good,Very Mature PMO office
good,"Chegava as 8hs, cumprimentava a todos da área e ia para um café. Depois lia-se os emails e com o cronograma do projeto em nas mãos seguia em frente com os ""follow-ups"" em acordo com a fase do projeto fazia reuniões de kick-off, check-point, status de produção, Piloto com os times do Projeto (Engenharia, Produção e Qualidade). Fazia interface com o time da China e conferências em horário noturno. Participava de treinamentos voltados a Qualidade e metodologias."
good,Large corporation allowed for a lot of growth and experience.
good,Worked on a Motorola factory of the future where we had what I refer to as a Cult inside of Motorola. Focused on changing the world. Some of the best people I have ever worked with. Inspirational leader who inspired everyone inside and outside of the company. I worked more 70-80 hr work weeks here than any other place...but loved it!
good,"Good opportunity to learn to work with a variety of departments. Responsibilities included approving large and small companies for credit concerning large projects and products. Also responsible for collecting money owed by the companies. Worked directly with sales, customers, and product departments. Also, traveled on occasion to meet with the customers and help arrange project guidelines on the financial side. The most difficult part of the job was getting payment from a few of the companies. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. There was a great team atmosphere at Mot."
good,great place to work with very nice supervisor n workers. i' ve learned to to build government communication products. the hardest part of the job was i had to wear steel toe boots which were very uncomfortable to stand in for 8 to 10 hours a day
good,The internship was a great learning experience with friendly people and a great place to start a new career.
good,"Watch out for Reductions In force efforts in N. America - IT Finance and Supply Chain."
good,It was like a family with the emphasis on ensuring there were activities to include all associates (e.g.yearly company picnic at Schlitterbahn). Everyone felt as though they were part of the family.
good,Por motivos de reestructuracion se perdieron varios empleos pero vale la pena trabajar ahi
good,"Motorola Solutions was a great company with great people.  They provided the experience that turned me into an effective engineer, with the ability to lead."
good,very good working environment and very much enjoyable to work with all co-workers.  It's very good company to work with and very friendly and all benefits
good,"Gleitzeit, Verschiedene Motorola Produkte durchlaufen im Reparaturservice."
good,"Es una empresa en transicion por lo que hay muchos cambios. El salario es bueno, pero es poco competitivo en comparacion con otras empresas. Se puede crecer profesionalmente y capacitarse, pero hay cosas aun que mejorar en cuanto a lo administrativo."
good,"Very nice people to work with. I have been with the company for 42 years since I was 18 so it tells about the company."
good,Closed due to change in market demand.  Company was unwilling to change course at the appropriate time.  Lack of innovation and a incompetent CEO also did not help things.
good,"É uma empresa muita exigente. Exige da postura no PDV, até as vendas dos smartphones."
good,"Motorola used to be the ultimate place to work at. Highly regarded for its technological, quality, work environment, innovation, etc. Unfortunately, the sr. management focussed more on the short-term stock market return rather than on the long-term company vision. Still a very good company, but, unfortunately, not what it was for a long time before."
good,"Flexible working hours. Systematic development process to guide new staff to handle new project. Friendly staff with lot of experience."
good,Solid company with great opportunities for new college graduates. Lots of organizational changes in progress as the transition to a smaller company after divestitures continues. Many positive changes have taken place including the headquarters move to downtown Chicago.
good,"Very family oriented environment. Once you've proven your worth, they will give flexibility to get flexibility."
good,all that I can said is a Great work place. Management was understanding and listen to work and heip out a lot on the floor.Supervisor was easy to get  alone with didn't bother you as long as you stayed productive.
good,"Motorola Solutions is a really laid back company with great people to work with and activities. The few issues I have are advancement, pay, and flexibility between coworkers and management. They don't really look at what you bring to the company and how well you do your job but how much you make buddies with management. I don't really think that is a proper way to move up in a company. The pay could be better.  The other issue is that management needs to lead by example and when a manager does something and a employees see that they think that they can do it too. But when the employee is put in that same situation the management seems to not be so flexible. Overall its still a good company to work for and I love the product they sell."
good,"During my tenure at Motorola I had the opportunity to learn several different disciplines related to Six Sigma, Product Design, Problem Solving Techniques, etc...  Although the working hours were excessive, it's a very good place to work."
good,Empresa boa para se trabalhar porém eles contratam apenas por temporário
good,"Good place to work, but it really was a good ole boy mentality.  You were given autonomy to get your job done, but training was lacking, so you had to learn about product at shows and on your own.  Management was definitely watching after their legacy employees, so you didn't have a diverse pool of new ideas coming into the company."
good,"Empresa muito boa, clima maravilhoso, a qual oferece um refeitório maravilhoso com muita diversidade e que tem bons profissionais."
good,"Motorola Solution was a better-than-average place to work. They offered full benefits & living wage. They were constantly evolving, right now they are acquiring other businesses."
good,"Great place advance yourself and be part of a overall vision of communication, people very welcoming and helpful.Manager look for the best in you and also help you in your areas of improvement"
good,"The work hours are flexible.  You can come early or late, as long as you work 8 hours per day and the lead or manger know your working schedule.  The work is challenged, always new thing to learn."
good,"Exposure to 6 sigma Project Management added to my exposure to PMP Project Management. Friendly and collaborative group of professionals creating new radio products. Excellent exposure to failure analysis, agency requirements, production of user  manuals and repair manuals. Design to manufacturing process of charging systems for portable radio units. Working with engineers and manufacturers both local and foreign to produce products that pass extensive and rigorous testing requirements. Best part of working at Motorola was the environment that encouraged learning. Worst part was the ending of my contract, wish I could still work there."
good,"A typical day involved design/documentation/testing, emails, reviews, project governance."
good,"the management is good and the team leaders are friendly.cool and fun environment,"
good,"worked at all three sit in Austin tx, taking care of users and support of servers, and tandem , traveled to many seminars around the country, started in computer room printing payroll and doing backups for the company, then moved on to tech support support into LANS network,then into fiber , was on call every other work, most of it was resolved at home,"
good,"hardworking cross-functional teams, startup culture, mobility division no longer present as it was, since it has been acquired by another company several years back"
good,"* Se aprenden cosas nuevas a diario basandose en la solución de problemas de producción."
good,"I truly value my experiences in working on Motorola Projects and hope to someday make back again. However in today's economy, I have a concern that the Project Management environment was never the most effective and efficient. Constant misdirection internally and from the client hampered progress and created an unsecure work environment."
good,"A typical day will involve a morning scrum meeting where you discuss what you did the previous day, what you are working on today and any problems that you are facing.  After that you'll return to work and pick up your tasks.  We work in three week sprints with quality gates that allow time for testing and rework.  We practice a scaled agile framework, so an entire 4 sprint release is planned well in advance, so you know what you and other teams are going to be working on, it is a really good environment for professional coding."
good,Management efficiency is questionable and it is not good for one person to be both board director and CEO. There are too many layers of management for a company of this size.
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, tem seus altos e baixos, mas é um lugar onde o trabalho em equipe é muito importante."
good,"Empresa tranquila e equipe animada. Não trabalhava diretamente, era uma terceirizada NVH"

good,"Motorola is a standard large company, providing good jobs locally in Chicagoland. Excellent benefits, and opportunities for education. Job security is typical of any large firm."
good,Group planned and executed training sessions for 3000 sales associates.  Great plan and great people made planning and delivering training classes an excellent experience.
good,"Sr. staff gives autonomous license to contractors once their expectations have been delivered."

good,Muy buena empresa lastima que ya no esta aqui pero era muy buena empresa
good,"Uma empresa boa de se trabalhar, mas o salário deixa a desejar."
good,Good support from engineers on cellphone technology at the time. To bad all cellphone production went offshore to other countries.
good,"I worked here very early in my career. I was unable to advance and find challenging opportunities. However, this was my responsibility and if I was working their now I believe I would have found more mentors and opportunities for advancement. I really enjoyed the team I worked with; an interesting group with fascinating activities beyond work."
good,"Ambiente muito bom, descontraído; a pressão de trabalho era muita especialmente fim de ano, porém sempre batíamos a meta e a gente era sempre motivado... boa liderança, benefícios eram bons... sempre tudo a mão"

good,"Aqui pude ver como é um RH estratégico e participativo nas decisões."
good,"All my professional culture was created at this company. I had many opportunities. It is a multidisciplinary company, which allows you understand how is possible to execute very complexes projects with success."
good,"A vida de promotor não era fácil, visitava em média 20 lojas por semana,com o objetivo de promover a venda do produto e destacar a marca no mercado. Como Merchandising mais correria ainda, subiu para media de 40 lojas semana, onde devolvi o trabalho positivação, treinamento nas lojas para o melhor conhecimento dos vendedores,relatórios de vendas, desempenho e crescimento dos pdv's e alguns momentos supervisionava a equipe onde adquiri a habilidade de líder."
good,Most sales professionals have home offices are in the field generally on sales calls. There is a lot of flexibility as long as you are performing your job effectively. The company has been completely streamlined.
good,Motorola was an experience because I had never worked in a warehouse setting with mostly men.  No down time and very strick on the breaks and lunch times
good,"a typical day at work: fully busy day "
good,"Learned a lot about Customer Service and how to meet the needs of our Customers while keeping the interests of the Company in mind as well. "

good,"A place where i learnt how to survive, face issues, over coming it."
good,"Como a criadora da metodologia 6Sigma, a Motorola preza muito pela qualidade. Boa parte da responsabilidade pelo declínio da empresa se deve à demora para lançar produtos por testar e re-testar e re-testar... Lá aprendi a ""Fazer Certo na Primeira Vez""."
good,"MSI (Motorola Solutions) is focused on providing high reliability communications solutions for public safety and government customers. While this sometimes causes a struggle to maintain a healthy work balance, employees are well rewarded for taking extra effort to ensure customer satisfaction. With an increasing mix of international customers, MSI has shifted design work closer to the customers. This means late night and early morning calls to coordinate around the world. It also means that advancement in the US has been limited. In response, MSI reduced the middle management ranks through voluntary and involuntary means, providing more opportunities for employees with less seniority."
good,"Overall its a good company. I hope there is no micromanage of employees. But at times, higher management takes weak decisions."
good,"Rotinas de produção, operar maquinas de SMD, Gerencia qualificada."
good,Interesting products for a rapidly shifting market.  Much of the work was for existing cable companies such as Comcast and Clear Channel.
good,"I started work with Motorola Automotive division as a Software engineer and worked on Power Control / Transmission Control Modules and got experience on assembly language coding and testing. After 2 years moved within company to in Mobile Handset development teams closer to home. Typical day involved coding and more system test scripts development for Radio team After experience also worked as Software Quality assurance and Software Project Management team. "
good,"This is an office full of people who don't want to be noticed.  They want to do their work, don't seek promotions, and never want to rock the boat.  For some people that's ideal, for me, it wasn't.  The benefits were great and the work life balance was, in the past, well respected (I have heard that that has changed since I left).  "
good,"My time at Motorola was wonderful, I was able to grow and had the flexibility to attend my families needs as necessary.   In 2003, I began at Symbol which was later acquired by Motorola.  It was a great experience as it exposed me to many experiences, such as traveling to customer sites, manning the booth at conventions, team development, projects all while managing Customer Care Team.  I truly enjoyed it and I would still be there if not for Corporate Downsizing."
good,"a typical day at work : 8:00am -5:00pm"
good,I always felt that the management had a plan to stay competitive.
good,I really enjoy the people that I work with and they are all very talented and forthcoming.  I have many friends here.  The environment is relaxed so long as you stay on top of your work.  The hardest part of the job is trying to get past all the meetings and actually execute the plan to a solution.  This is clearly an attribute of being a part of such a large organization.
good,"O salário era maior, e a carga horaria pequena, muito bom. Tinha fretado."
good,"Acho que numa visão geral , só tenho á agradecer pelos muitos cursos e aprendizado que levo de bagagem nas minhas experiências, claro, que como em todas as empresas tinham seus problemas de gerenciamento e troca de funcionários, mas no geral, uma empresa muito boa, com ambiente muito agradável."
good,"I enjoyed very much to work in Motorola , it was great experience to work with Motorola ."
good,"Ótimo horário de trabalho, fácil aprendizado. Sempre está fazendo uma parte do celular nunca enjoa e nunca fica em pé demais ou sentado demais. Ótimo restaurante. Pena que foi somente 3 meses por ser contrato e ter tido a infelicidade de vencer meu contrato no mês que não estão contratando."
good,Testing phone and internet applications; with great programs state of the art technology in telephone software.
good,Very hard measures for Quality product.
good,"During the 24 years working for Motorola, I found the people to be very easy to work with. The management and co-workers were all dedicated to the company and were helpful to each other whenever the need arose. This allowed myself and others to gain both knowledge and experience in the field of wireless communications and in the video delivery systems."
good,Motorola is a good company to work with good health benefits. Many contracts are on the horizon and if they come though more long term jobs could be created.
good,"Muito boa de trabalhar, so que quase nao temos vida social. Excelentes colegas de trabalho"
good,"For the past 18 years I have been working in a Hi Reliability engineering lab focusing on space-based satellite electronics hardware. I have been involved in testing and troubleshooting this type of hardware both at the module level and at the system level. I have aligned RF converters, synthesizers and Power Amplifiers requiring testing and troubleshooting problems to the component level. I have been worked with the lead engineers to identify the root cause problem of complex systems over a wide range of environmental conditions including Vibration, Thermal Vacuum and Thermal Cycling of space hardware. The last 10 years I have been the System Test Lead on two different programs supervising up to 8 technicians."
good,"Solid company to work for. Work condition were favorable, as in any top corporation."
good,This is a great place to Contract for. Working here is hard work but great.
good,"Serviço agradavel, mas sem muitas chances de estabilidade na empresa."
good,"É uma empresa bem dinâmica, ao mesmo tempo uma empresa em que o funcionário realmente aprende aquilo que foi designado, com mudanças frequentes de funções o que não torna repetitivo."
good,Aprendi teoria e pratica como se realizar um bom deug em placas SMD
good,Day to day working of facilities related work
good,Very paternal work environment with a passion for quality and continous improvent
good,"people are nice, friendly, free coffee or tea all day. Co-workers willing to help when needed. Most managers understand there is a family life after work. Allowances for time off."
good,"Coordinate with the manufacturing department to make sure all safety guidelines are being meet, and training of new hires to ensure that company safety standards are adhered to. I learned about the majority of chemicals and major disaster protocol, and the finding in the learning process were very eye opening. Reported to the V.P overseeing the mesa factory. My co workers were highly trained and motivated to the safety of the personnel, and that really complement my ability to grow. Hardest part of the job was making sure that sight was always safe as this can become waring with over 4000 employees on each of the 4 shifts.Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting every single staff member yearly when renewing their safety certification."
good,Motorola was a company I would have stayed once I finish school but at that time Motorola was not doing too well was on the verge of file bankruptcy; it was times when our paycheck came late so I had to leave once I graduated from school hoping I could secure my future; at the time didn’t look like they would survive but look at the company know they are doing great in the cell phone market
good,"I learned about software engineering with the cellular infrastructure group. The people were always awesome. My management tried to accommodate me during a difficult divorce, but it did affect my work too much, which was sad. I had so much more to offer Motorola with my skills The most enjoyable part of the job were the intelligent people you worked with. Sometimes I wish I could go back in time to work with them again. Excellent people."
good,Great company and great culture but bad mgmt. Too much favoritism/nepotism.Engg who are friends of managers did great and enggs.
good,"I've worked at Moto Mobile devices for most of my career, my rating reflects that of Moto Solutions. Solutions is considerably better organized, and I don't feel like I am being stepped on by the next guy on his path to glory :). After 8 years you get 26 days of PTO, and it is easy to work with your manager to get issues resolved."
good,I spend over 21 years at what is now known as Motorola Solutions and enjoyed most all of it. It was my first real job out of college and got me into the world of technology. I have stayed in that arena now my entire career.
good,"I would sign in then go to my supervisor to get the workorder for the week and check the inventory for all the items on the list needed to be built, sometimes I would weigh them and pull the items from stock."
good,"Lots of inspiration and innovation."
good,"I didnt get my bonus, no paid for my leave balance. However its a good  company and good culture. The salary also quite high. The PCN team is really supportive. Everything is good, only me is not really good in English that the why I cant deliver my job properly."
good,Great place to work as a software engineer. The top leadership needs to do a better job of communicating future endeavors and vision for the company. Friendly coworkers and interns.
good,"Pros:"
good,"Es recomendable, se aprende mucho de variso procesos, hay relacion con cleintes nacionales e internacionales."
good,"Highly professional organisation with a strong work ethic (do what you need to to do), but very customer-focused in the process."
good,Used to a great workplace to boost your career and if you got great management at your location they used to help you to learn and grow and used to help you in any way you want .
good,"The Crown Beverage Cans Ltd was the first 2 pieces can making plant in Vietnam and I was recruited to lead the accounting department , purchasing and IT."
good,"Great management team. Very empathetic.  Manager are considerate of the employees and treat them with respect.  Each person situation being unique,is considered in that manner"
good,"It's unfortunate that Motorola has experienced so many set backs and mass ""restructuring"" i.e. department closings, US jobs now overseas. It used to be a fantastic place to work and sounds like it is slowly turning around again."
good,"Overall a great place to work. Opportunities to learn on the job, travel to conferences, informal mentoring. Upper management seemed a bit out of touch with the market."
good,The company had good and bad people.I was happy there until I started getting bullied by my manager. And I would have stayed if I had been promoted to manager. However the chance never came.
good,Worked on assembly line. Standing for long periods was definitely a challenge but I enjoyed the technical aspect of the responsibilities and the benefit package was great!
good,"Loved working at MSI! Out of the box thinking, teamwork and being proactive was always encouraged and rewarded. Would still be there but was being asked to relocate which was not an option for me and my family. "
good,One of the most enjoyable parts of the job is being able to have a workplace culture that revolves around teamwork and problem solving for our customers.
good,My time at Solution was as a contractor. I tried to get reinstated at Motorola but there were lay offs. The Motorola culture is that you need to know the right people to be placed in a position when there are layoffs in other departments. I never had that.
good,"Great vision, innovate team. Really feel like you are giving something back"
good,Typically a day would begin a 8am and end at 5pm.  Work was steady and there would be the occasional rush week when you would be asked to work overtime to meet an important deliverable.
good,"Very professional with introducing you into the work place. Many stations to work in, friendly workers all very focused in their work. Fast paced environment."
good,"Excellent  job / work life balance along with compensation benefits. Very Flexible work environment, However slow pace for career growth. Typically 8 - 5.30 work hours, Off site calls after hours creeps into family time."
good,"I loved my job at Motorola Inc. I did not want to leave but my position moved to Mexico and I received a severance package. It is a team environment. When I worked there the people where great to work with and are still my friends. The best is when there is a need to provide support to people who have been in a tornado or some kind of mishap, this team performed at it's best and was wonderful to work with. Training was important and this company supports it. You can't go wrong there."
good,"Working at Motorola  was a great experience. They offered training, encouraged development and wanted people to succeed. Overall working at Motorola was a true blessing"
good,I worked there when computer aided drafting was still in its infancy at the company.  I went in early to learn the system on my own time.  The company back then picked who they wanted to spend the money on to learn it.  I learned the system quickly.  The company was impressed and moved me into the CAD room; goodbye ink on mylar!
good,"É uma franquia que trabalha pra Motorola, chamada rastrecall. Não tenho o que reclamar, porém o salários e benefícios não são compatíveis com o Mercado."
good,"managed short term and long term disability claims, worker's compensation claims, ADA claims. Also treated employees for injuries and personal illnesses.  Responded to chemical spills, leaks and inhalations.  Completed random drug screenings and managed the Hearing Conservation Program.  The best part of the job was the interactions and educational options for the employees, the worst part of the job was working nights at the end of my employment."
good,"Typical day was 8 - 5.  "
good,"I was part of a work force reduction."
good,Challenging and interesting position as can liaise with many different parties and learn more logistics and interpersonal skills. Meetings to meet up with forwarders every month to discuss problematic shipments.
good,It was a nice job at first but became very competitive later as the company was struggling financially and the factory I worked in eventually shut down.
good,"At Motorola, I was a contract worker.  My main task was to format project proposals, and then copy them for distribution.  The people I worked with were very nice.  I was particularly impressed with the amount of training I received.  I was released because I was part of a new program that the division was offering, but it was not well used."
good,"I was in the wrong role. I am an engineer and was in an inventory management position...tough to write an unbiased review. The people here are AMAZING! Very friendly, always willing to help. Management is open to new ideas, but it takes a long time to implement them."
good,"Good place to work: a lot of different possibilities for find the best work/direction for your career. Free snacks, fruits and tee. A modern, just renovated, opened space architecture."
good,Motorola was my first job and worked for production and with a lot of responsibility and safety in the production of beepers for the networks of communication in those days.
good,Working for Motorola Cellular Infrastructure Group was a great place to work.  I learned most of my technical skills working there. Work place culture was very relaxed.
good,The goal is always to succeed at all cost.  You need to be in it to win it.The culture drives the business.  Employees are the number one commodity.  They move the vision to the desired outcome.
good,"Good place to work and learn. "
good,Was a good work environment with rewards for hard work and dedication.  Set up the line for the shift to build cell phones and helped my supervisor monitor number of phones built for that shift.
good,"Good place to work."
good,"A nice place to work at. Handled four south zones in Purchase field. Handling Purchase order,making Purchase order,Forwarding invoices to accounts department and Interacting with Accounts for payment of Vendors. "
good,"This was a decidedly alternative business unit that had a Silicon Valley-ish culture, It developed and initiated content/features we now take for granted now on our smart phones."
good,"I was a contractor here, they outsourced recruiting to a third party so my position was eliminated.  I really enjoyed the people, the new office downtown was great.  Very close to both train stations.  I was sorry to leave here."
good,"Wonderful company to work for, complete work life balance, very good pay and benefits. The Management is slow to adopt to changes in the technology world."
good,"Good work environment, trained personnel, necessary resources to execute, training and support in the execution of the works, exigency in the fulfillment of objectives."
good,I am so proud my experience in Motorola. Motorola's wireless telephone handset division was a pioneer in cellular telephones. Motorola designed and sold wireless network equipment such as cellular transmission base stations and signal amplifiers.
good,"Enjoyed the two years but company was struggling financially and restructuring. I was requested to relocate and due to family issues, not willing to do so. Shortly after leaving, business was sold."
good,Impressive history which ultimately failed due to bad management decisions. Great workplace and work/life balance along with opportunities to be seconded abroad if willing to. Bring it back to life....
good,"Empresa multinacional muito agradável de trabalhar, porém com algumas falhas no critério de avaliação de desempenho"
good,"good management at first level. fast paced nice co-workers. to bad the plant had to close. Motorola is a shell of what it use to be, so many good workers have lost their jobs."
good,As a Floor support technician I was always facing new and exciting job challenges. The culture was changing constantly as we improved our production lines and abilities and we were always learning something new. management at our level was fair and competent and did the best with what they had. Our team was responsible for keeping the test systems running at top efficiency and using proactive maintenance to reduce breakages and downtime and the people were a real joy to work with.
good,"Good co-workers;"
good,"Maintain, repair, calibrated, modified, installed hardware and software  all equipment in the Final Assembly and Photolithography area. Join with Manufacturing in team in developed equipment."
good,"Worked with a good group of engineers; focus was to get the design done not only on schedule, but also right. Life/work balance was generally very good."
good,I got to work in a fast paced environment with engineers in production problem solving issues. It was a great experience and learned a lot.
good,"I worked at Motorola for 13 years before the cellular business was acquired by Nokia. Even after Motorola reduced employee benefits, it still had a very good benefits package and competitive wages."
good,"O dia da motorola era chegar na linha de produção e fazer montagens e testes de celulares."
good,"Ambiente bom de trabalho, com diversas atividades novas todos os dias, mas com plano de estágio que deixa a desejar, esperava aprender mais no tempo trabalhado lá."
good,"The day starts with reviewing the schedule and matching resources to the tasks to be accomplished. The depot depended very much on a self-motivating work force.  Members of the team needed to be on their toes as to organizing what needs to be done when, and then going about meeting the goal. "
good,Same as for GE as both were the client of Igate. This was my first project in IT career.Learned alot about cooperate world.EVeryone was helpful at work.
good,"This job had some interesting and some boring aspects to it.  You had to support all STB's (set top boxes) for many past years with various vendors who designed TV apps for it.  The support for learning about their ""sample"" applications was low at the time but with the free online resources available today it's probably better now, although this industry has changed and becoming obsolete in many ways.  Writing a gaming demo to present to a vendor to bring in new business for them was fun."
good,"é uma ótima Empresa,está sempre abrindo as portas para pessoas com e sem experiencias independentes da idade"
good,Motorola seemed to be a work friendly environment. The benefits package was awesome. A great place to work. This would have been a place of continued employment if the factory hadn't closed the doors on its employees.
good,Great place to work at! Everyone is friendly and the focus is heavily on maximizing everyone's potential. Hard workers get benefited a lot.
good,"Team player, supportive management, learn from other,"
good,"The summer internship with the technical writing team was one that set me on the path I am on today.  As a student with little experience outside of the classroom, the team included me on many different types of  projects and showed me what tools I would need in my career.  The company provided many opportunities to network with other interns and employees throughout the summer."
good,"Great co-workers and immediate management.  Flexibility for balancing life needs.  Team Management trusts employees to know and do their jobs.  Training opportunities regularly.  Advancement available to employees; not much for contractors."
good,"Customer service is what drives all I do.  I believe that, everyone I deal with is my customer and treat them as such, from opening a trouble ticket to discussing past due accounts it is all very important. No customer is to small."
good,Motorola was fun and exciting with growth in the early to mid 90's but changes in the telecommunications industry and worldwide competition led to massive downsizing.
good,"Great place to work, good benefits and culture.  Work and family balance.  Had an opportunity to lead and develop employees throughout my career."
good,"Local ótimo para se trabalhar, limpeza, organização, seus superiores sempre apoiando, e te dando oportunidade."
good,"check the prgress off all sites under construction"

good,"Uma empresa que exigia muita qualidade. As oportunidades que a empresa oferece aos funcionários são boas, alem dos bons  benefícios."
good,great hours and fantastic employees also upper management is way too stressed
good,"A lot of training classes provided "
good,"work is low stress, very easy, but can also become fast paced at times. Management is great and are willing to work around any problems you have. the only downside is you get layed off at the end of every month for a week or so."
good,"the culture was changing at the time I left - which was one of the reasons I chose to leave."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es excelente, hay flexibilidad en los horarios y los empleados tenemos muchos beneficios adicionales."

good,great place with great people and opportunities for advancement.
good,"1. LTE planning and field trial support."
good,"I truly enjoyed working for this company. Great work Ethics."
good,"Busy day at work. lots of new stuff and variety of tools, technology to work with, management is good, helping. Co-workers are ready to help, just too far from home now. Overall nice place to work."
good,Great company during the boom times. Ramp down of fab and massive lay offs was difficult.
good,". Atenção e agilidade."
good,"Work environment is friendly. Coworkers normally help each other. Managers listens to your feedback and take actions as needed. Work is not very challenging, especially when you gain a lot experiences. Career growth opportunity is limited."
good,"Small intimate teams"
good,"Worked on assembly line or it was set up that way, eleven people on the line 2 working triage and download, two working tear down four working build up, and three working test and light cleaning. "
good,Used to love going to work every day but women in management drive was just beginning socially so advancement was tough.
good,"Uma empresa muito boa para desenvolver o seu trabalho oferecendo fretado, refeição e um bom salário."
good,"Aprendi muito com a Motorola,pois trabalhei no meio de pessoas diferentes e aprendi a lidar com cada um sempre respeitando essas diferenças."
good,Motorola was great place to work. You could learn as much as you would want.

good,"Motorola promotes independent thinking and initiative."
good,One has to work 2 - 3 hours more daily to achieve the target. I had opportunity to implement the latest technology available for Communication research & development task.  Dynamic management encouraging employee for team work.  Very co-operative group of highly qualified engineers were my co-workers.  It was state-of-art R & D work for new communication product.
good,"Productive workplace and regular feedback on company performance and future vision from management. Constant communications from senior management to keep employees updated on the latest happenings and their impact."
good,Formally Next Level Communication before Motorola acquired it.I learned a lot of things during the time working here.  People were fantastic and this company had a lot to offer
good,"Overall a good company to work for. Always plenty to learn in an ever changing environment."
good,Enjoyed My internship. Intern projects were interesting.
good,"A typical day was communicating with insurance companies to appeal denials. I learned a lot in regards to medical terminology. Also regarding CPT codes and ICD-9 codes. Management mostly operated by the book so you always knew were you stood. Co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was the amount of time representative had to be on the phone with insurance companies. Many of the claims should have been paid but if a denial occurred, I had to get of the phone and object to the denial. The most enjoyable part was learning medical terminology."
good,"•Coordenador de Produção, acompanhar e treinar operadores que iniciam em seus postos de trabalho, trabalho em equipe, atitudes positivas e motivadoras, facilidade para comunicação, análise e definição de prioridades e coordenação de grupos.	"
good,"I worked for a project manager in product development writing the developer manuals for wireless corporate customers. The volume of work was a challenge, as was the content (and chasing SMEs in different time zones). I was always given the resources I asked for, and my deadlines were challenging but reasonable. The toughest part, since I was a contractor, was getting paid - it took me 14 months to get paid for one of my projects. "
good,Nice people and good company to work for but was sold to NSN. Global Marketing role helped understand global market needs.
good,Motorola Solutions gives the employees a lot of power to make decisions on their own.  This helps to make things more efficient.  They make it very clear what is expected of you.  There is a lot of work to be done and you need to stay on your toes.  I found the co-workers and management very easy to get along with.
good,Working from home has benefits as well as pitfalls. I have spent the last few years going from a network designer to a technical manager with 6 direct reports.
good,Routine testing and adjusting FM Mobile radios
good,"Investe no desenvolvimento dos funcionarios, desenvolve produtos que facilitam o dia das pessoas o que eh gratificante, presa a etica, eh uma oportunidade cultural por operar globalmente."
good,"Muito Boa empresa , só em termos de estabilidade que deixa a desejar !"
good,pessoas agradáveis para conviver
good,Leadership team encourage good results
good,"A empresa é de ótima estrutura,deixa os funcionarios a vontade,oferece os beneficios que uma empresa de grande porte oferece mais trabalha muito com temporarios,não se preocupra muito em manter os funcionários que estão dando resultados positivos para a empresa,isso desmotiva muito o funcionário,e faz com que a imagem da empresa não seja muito agradável,deixa o funcionário inseguro.Tirando esse aspecto que pode ser revisto a empresa é ótima,adorei trabalhar la,aprendi muito e com certeza voltaria em uma nova oportunidade."
good,"i taking wolk round, i learned everything here,i can manage all things related to customers,"
good,Typical day would consist of polling results from test suites ran overnight. Identifying any issues prior to the morning call. Spending most of the morning on conference calls discussing status and critical issues. Afternoon would be spent planning the nights effort and work load and scheduling resources. Evening would be spent assisting test execution across all campuses. Then starting the process over the next day.
good,"It is a decent company to work for. It has flexible work hours and interesting assignment. However, it is doing downsizing for the last 5 year, and Google's purchase made it worse."
good,1. Good company to gain experience
good,"learning new technoloy, on-star, motorola products, lerning trouble shooting, and circuit boards/electronics"
good,empresa dinámica e agradavel de trabalhar.
good,"Working for Motorola Solutions for the past 3 years has been a positive experience. Currently, I am working at the Federal Technical Center and at times it can be challenging. The high volume of equipment that comes through the department can be overwhelming for anyone but I find it to be rewarding. Typically I work at my bench but that is hardly where I spend most of my day. With my roll as the Sr. Electronic Technician, I come face to face with various tasks such as proper training of technical candidates, ATE repair, production reports and repair documentation. Our technicians have entrusted me with providing correct and accurate information to keep their production fluid. With the expansion of the department, I am the first to receive training on new equipment. Management trusts that I am efficient in giving instruction to the rest of the team. They are a group of hard working individuals that are eager to provide assistance where necessary. The team is all on the same page when it comes to getting the work done and this environment is provided by our management. They allow us to voice ideas and give us constant feedback to improve our processes."
good,"as a contractor, I thought it was a great place to work at. Friendly ppl and fun. Yes I said fun. Enjoyed it very much."
good,"Empresa muito tranquila de trabalhar, lideres competentes, sabem o que fazem, porem não tem muita estabilidade, quando menos se espera pode ser dispensado, mas é um local muito para se adquirir experiencia, pois eles ensinam de tudo, não fica somente em uma função."
good,It was a good job until they decided to start laying people off due to the loss of market share.
good,Good work experience. Like any other big company there are arrogant n rude co workers which are not that cooperative and helpful.
good,"Executive leader with expertise in all facets of Manufacturing and Quality engineering, New Product Introduction, Lean principles and advanced manufacturing technologies. Skilled in collaborating with all members of the organization to achieve business and financial objectives. Instrumental in streamlining and improving processes, enhancing productivity, and implementing technology solutions. Adept at working effectively both independently and collaboratively as part of a team to meet strict deadlines and project specifications."
good,"Empresa boa para trabalhar."
good,"Great company, great management, great engineers, great technology, great products.  Spent most of my career here, and management knows how to handle change as needed to keep company competitive."
good,"well organized, teams were very cohesive, there was respect within my peer group, if an emergency came up, management looked out for their employees.  It was very refreshing"
good,Really I spent a nice time in this company .My all senior and my junior are very helpful and sporting and I learn a lot of things by my seniors and trainers
good,Una gran experiencia trabajan muy relajados y en quipo.
good,"Good management"
good,"a pesar de estar por un periodo menor a un año. Los cambios de cacs que se generaban era muy radicales, no se tomaba en cuenta los sitios de residencia del empleado para una mejor movilización, por lo que faltaba una mejor gestión."
good,I have a lot of fun working for Motorola. Every week I'm assigned new tasks and am constantly learning. This is a great job for anyone looking to learn about electronics and the shipping and receiving process.
good,"Motorola Solutions is a place where you can make a great career if you are looking for a high paced, fast moving environment.  If you dedicate your time to the company it's rewarded properly.  It's high stress, but also rewarding in what they do serving the public safety industry."
good,It was a good place to work at temporary as a recent high school graduate and now college student. It's not a job where socializing is part of but if your an introvert than its the place for you. Some days you will be very busy and others there literally no work. It's an okay place to work in.
good,"I worked there for 16 years. It was a good job but with selling off parts of the company and other things I took a buyout knowing I was going to be a victim of ""cost cutting"""
good,"Love to hire military but sometimes it is hard to move up unless your willing to relocate, especially in the field technician arena. Upper management is changing quite a bit but it mixes things up."
good,"20 years at Motorola - They invest in you and you have a meaningful job providing life saving communication solutions."
good,Typical day at work is being a customer service representative to the engineers and managers I support.  I know that at any time my current priority could be de-prioritized of an emergent issue.
good,"The work is easy  since I was trained to do the final inspection of the VS2 radios and I've learned how communication radios are made from scratched/ raw materials. The management are strict only on footwear we wear it should be steel toe which protect us from any dangers.  The workplace is friendly,kind and warm, The hardest part of the job is not so hard but just to carry a little heavier radios that they manufactured or assembled.  Love working there for warm friendly staff / people I've met. Only thing I worked temporary thru the employment agency."
good,Would have retired with the company if it had not transitioned to internationally located operation. Motorola Solutions left Louisville and offered no opportunity for any current employee to stay with the company.

good,Really enjoyed working for Motorola.  Coming to work allowed me to make a difference.  All the people worked together to help the company grow.  Learned how to better support folks.
good,"good working environment"
good,"Office politics run this place.  Otherwise, the work is nice.  The environment is kinda cut-throat. Enjoyed my time there.  Work fast-paced and innovative.  Encourage you to be creative."
good,This was my first job.  I started as a Technical Support Engineer and was promoted to Manager of Support.  Moved into Quality Management and later into Project Management.  Motorola always fostered employee growth and career advancement

Very flexible with time-off, except for the end of business quarters, but there is plenty of time-off provided. The only downside is that is on a manufacturing schedule which means the working hours are 1st, 2nd, or 3rd shift, which is not always ideal. Also, because the amount of work to do is dictated by whether or not there are orders, one week can be busy with things to do, and the next can be very slow and tedious.

good,"Starting at 4:30am, getting the work orders, inspect the machines making sure the correct parts were on the machine for the day to start the line. Keeping the line running at a good pace, not to back the line up or run to fast, hoping there is not a break down of the line to get the order done. any time we left the line we had to re-inspect our machine making sure the right parts were on the machine. Worked with management from the bottom to the top.The company had an open door policy at the time. If things were not resolved at one level, one could talk to the next person in managerial position to resolve issues. A diversified work place of people whom we had to learn about in order to make the job work for all. The hardest part of the job was the long hours. By time the end of the work week came we all cheered each other on to get the jobs done. If the front end of the line was finished we went to the other parts of the line to make sure there were no bottle necks in the line to keep the line running as smooth as possible. If ther were no problems with a build we would receive some type of bonus. We were completely responsible for a build from the start of the line until shipping in distribution.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the challenge of the work and the people.

good,"This is where I spent most of my life, and consider these to be the best years.  When I started out I was young and eager to learn.  I had many opputunities for education at Motorola, as we had Motorola University and learned many things about the semiconductor business and business in gerneral.  They paid for classes that I need for my job at some of the universities.  I was very busy at the job I had in MOS-5 for 22 years, it was very demanding.  I gained alot of knowledge and used it to my benefit.  Most of the people I worked with thought I was an engineer.  I was very respected by the other fabs and departments I worked with which I appreciated.  I had to fight for many of my advancements, but it was worth it.  We had a well oiled team and we were the money makers for Motorola semiconductor, then they decided to outsource our jobs to China and close the Mesa Plant down, this was very sad end of one of the best chapters in my life.  I enjoyed the years when employees were in demand and we were treated with respect and appreciation.  It was very sad to know those days were at an end."

good,"I managed different logistic sites globally, maintained communication between different teams daily and weekly. Worked on different tech specs and replace programs for various locations. My job taught me how to be extremely detail oriented, goal driven and sharpened my time management skills. This job required a lot of traveling, which I loved. This job was the best job I ever had, I would go back to this job in a heart beat if it was still open. My co-workers, who I still keep in contact with, were the best team I ever worked with. There really no downside to this job, except that my company kept reorganizing our division quite a few times."
good,"Each day presented the ""hand-on"" approach in dealing with new communication product.  Learning to program equipment for direct shipping and supervising employees in the systematic packaging and coding of all outgoing equipment was somewhat challenging. Worked with a very diverse group (world-wide) and I learned from them as well. The hardest part of the job was having to ""pull a shipment"" because of an error in the processing.The most enjoyable part of the day was when all expected shipping for the shift was accomplished."

good,"I worked in a 6 inch wafer cell at Motorola. This was a new division with Motorola, and everyone was new to the place except the management team. We each had our jobs, but we had to work as a team to come up with the finished product. Once we learned our jobs, the managers made sure that we were cross trained to do other peoples jobs as well. They felt this was good, because it not only made us more valuable to the company, but also made sure that we were not stuck in one position within the company. One of the things that I remember is having our weekly meetings, the management team made the new employees feel like we were equals with them. They use to tell us that we were a new division within Motorola, that we could make our own rules for our area, and as new employees, we were just as valuable as the managers were, and they listen to our ideas and inputs. I eventually worked towards the cleanroom area and I got to see the finished product after everyone got done with the process. After learning the cleanroom and its protocol, I became the Quality Assurance person for our division. I had to inspect every wafer and make sure that they were within code and ready for our next customer. Once I inspected them, I got the lots together and got them to a controled environment until they were ready to ship to the next person. I also had to log all the wafers into the computer and report to our divisions boss every week if we had met our quota and if the cell was profitable. I also ordered all the supplies for our divison and our office."
good,"Uma ótima empresa, com bom salario, bons horarios, bons lideres."
good,All this industry was new to me. So I really learned alot of cool processes. They made me a SMT operator and i became one of the best pretty quickly.

good,"Great pay, offer training, state of the art equipment, flexible hours - working from home.  Great place to work at but sometimes management was clueless on direction department should take, causing inside rivalry fractions to occur within the department."
good,I would get to work and get thing ready for the employee to get stated for the day of work. Make sure that all the areas was clean from the night before so that know would get 35 people. They were in my care for them acid that they used for the wafer's they would not get burn so of it you would and some of it you wouldn't. To me there were not hard part of the job. Just a day at work I spend a lot of hour's there because I had to make sure that we did what we have to for the company.

good,"Motorola was a very client needs and employee needs orientated company. They believed in training. The best investment they made was in training. For myself, this attitude inspired me to take on extra projects and work extra time to get the job done. For example I was deployed to South Korea to teach a Cellular Technology course to KMT (Korean Mobile Telephone). I was inadvertently sent a week earlier than the class started. Motorola had the policy that trips of over eight hours of flight went first class. I realized that it would be cost efficient for me to remain in South Korea. I called the KMT contact and informed them that I was a week early and asked if they needed any assistance that I might be able to provide. I just cannot sit around doing nothing, it is boring. They asked me to come to their cellular telephone equipment site. I was amazed at the scope of their problems. In about  two hours I had the entire system tuned and performing correctly. The KMT management called the resident Motorola Engineer and informed the engineer what I had done. I was not aware that their was a Resident Motorola System Engineer on site."

Unfortunately, I was part of Google-Motorola Mobility most recent workforce reduction,so I am excited to start my next career in the Golf Industry. I have tremendous passion for the Golf industry and I want to take my experience for the past 27+ years and do something I love!"

good,Great Place to work! Enjoyed my time with this great company
good,"If it had not moved overseas, I would have still been there. Working a shift which was good for me 4pm-12am at the time allowed me to have my days to be with my daughter at the time. My co-workers were great, I worked in what was called the private sector, there were only 12 of us, so this made us family. There really wasn't anything hard about the job, everyone worked together for the good of the company."
good,It was a plasure to work with Motorola solutions UK limited for the past 5 years.
good,"By far the most professional company I ever had the priviledge of working for. I learned the basic one on one selling approach that is the most success selling approach of all time. customer service was the #l priority. Keeping the customer was more valued then adding new, and of course, more profitable."
good,"Em geral é uma boa empresa que oferece muitos beneficios,e que sempre ajuda seus funcionarios."
good,"Nice environment to work, very friendly co-workers, I learned a lot there, got a lot of experience in my field,"

good,"Started out as Executive Assistant to the Technical Department supporting several Engineers and the VP of the department. Then was promoted to Human Resources Assistant - set up interviews, job listings, reviewed resumes, worked with guidelines and set up procedures and worked with all the laws regarding such. Was able to help alot of people and loved doing that position and learned alot. The part I didn't like was having to lay people off (which you learn to do and have done since but not my favorite part of the job)."
good,"Era um aprendizado a cada dia, posso dizer que foi a melhor empresa que ja trabalhei, em relação aos trabalhos desenvolvidos, aos colegas de trabalho que sempre estavam em harmonia, de bom humor, aprendi coisas que vou e estou levando para a vida toda, tanto profissional como pessoal."
good,Enjoyable work and enjoyed the work detail and overall responsilities
good,Empresa ótima para si trabalhar sempre preocupada com o bem estar do funcionário.
good,great place too work and they made sure that they show you the respect of an employee. They followed all safety guidelines and as well great pay.
good,"I ran surface mount machines, xray machines. Some of the supervisors were alright some were not. Got along with most of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is standing for hours on end."
good,This job has been the most challenging and fun. Lots of areas for promotion and a great deal of teamwork to keep the job interesting and fun!
good,I was very happy working with Motorola for approximately 5 years. It was a very good experience working with them - the only reason I moved on was because I had to relocate myself for family reasons.
good,very clean and friendly people to work with I work in many of the facilities doing mostly painting
good,"It was like working with a huge family. Everyone was committed to the company and the company was committed to us. I always felt that I was rewarded for the hard work I did and even more important, I felt appreciated. Even when I was laid off, they provided for me and sent me back to school, sent me to a staffing agency to help me find a new job and provided a great severance package. I was devastated to lose the job and never expect to find a company to rival Motorola."
good,"Motorola has a great bunch of people. I miss working there. There was a great feeling of optomizm in the 70's and then in the late 80's we saw some decline. The areas I worked in were sold to Freescale, and ON."
