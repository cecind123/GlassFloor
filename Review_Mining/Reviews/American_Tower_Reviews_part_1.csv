rating,review
bad,"No command on vendor team. Lack of material supply. Long pending approval of faulty materials."
bad,I cannot review appropriately due to the guidelines listed here. Avoid this company if you have morals as This company quite simply uses any avenue to avoid federal compliance.
bad,"Their offices are very nice and they have an awesome cafeteria downstairs which is very convenient for lunch.  The structure is good, however there are many test you must complete."
bad,It was a great place if you worked in collections however I moved into Marketing and the manager was one of the worst I have ever experienced. I had to leave the company as there was no way to go back to collections.
bad,"The work there is not challenging, and there is very little room for growth. People are not very team oriented at all, and the company culture is very weird and seclusive. Would not recommend."
bad,"The company is corrupt, solely profit based. The EHS programs are a sham. The administrators and your managers will tell you to your face that you are to be seen, not heard because you, as the regulators arms, do not make the company money. "
bad,hay mucha discriminación con los empleados y hay abuso
bad,"-Established cliques make it hard for new employees to grow -Incredible lack of communication within departments and cross-functionally, specifically with HR/recruiting. -management recognizes the fact that planning is a challenge yet does nothing to address it -we’re supposed to “Focus on solutions, not problems” so most employees don’t care to address the root cause of a problem so that it doesn’t happen again...this makes most situations an unnecessary fire drill -micromanaging...manager wants us to copy her on all deliverables yet clearly can’t properly manage their inbox due to so many emails. We’re expected to respond to all inquiries within 24 hours and that should be applied to all levels of the organization. Mgr can’t keep up with our inquiries as their inbox is flooded with unnecessary emails due to the need to micromanage. -goals for the year are given towards end of 1st quarter, why should employees be hounded about being proactive when management/VPs fail to empower us to do so? -performance reviews are completely opinion based...a company that operates based on data should also be reviewing performance based on data, metrics. -nobody wants to take responsibility for their actions...accountability is a huge issue here -cross functional teams routinely dismiss recommendations and then cause more unnecessary fire drills when they realize that going about a certain task THEIR way didn’t work out as they expected -training does not exist for most roles"
bad,"A typical work day was always over 12 hours. Managers lack of understanding objectives, found work flows being worked more than once to get the work gathered and reported. Managers divide co-workers so they don't get to know each other or talk about the way the Managers organize and schedule work and work flows.Using out dated software was common place/ integration of new software meant working old software and it's problems repeatedly . Hardest part of job, always having to re-work work and dealing with co-workers who have little training or experience. Most enjoyable traveling to remote place and seeing the countryside without much or any safety equipment for employees to use ordepend on."
bad,"A typical day 4 hours of solitaire, lunch, 3 hours of minesweeper.  I never had anything to do.  I requested assignments from managers and was referred to other managers or told to set up meetings to discuss assignments.  Management was rude and hoarding work to attain accolades.  Co-workers were great but at my level - junior attorney they were bored too, just using this job as a stepping stone.  Hardest part of the job was the boredom - I quit.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the lunchroom, it was quite nice and stocked well."
bad,"No training. Micromanage attitude. High turnover. Poor management. Had to take a doctors note if you were out sick. "
bad,"To much nepotism,  hiring friends and family is never a good thing especially on the same team. HR allows supervisors and managers to treat you any kind of way. Very micromanaging pending on who you are. Benefits are great but salaries lower than most companies. "
bad,"Procura el bienestar y equilibrio de vida de sus empleados, gestionando de manera efectiva el desarrollo de cada uno de ellos"
bad,good experience obtained in o&m maintaining manpower supervisor and technician and we maintain good uptime for infra passive.
bad,A good company to work for with great benefits. People are extremely helpful. Lots of team concepts & building. Able to work from home as they supply all the needed essentials
bad,"Don't expect to move up and don't expect a decent raise, even if you do more/better work than anyone else.  "
bad,It was the worst place I worked for. Not good....The company culture was unacceptable.
bad,"Not a perfect place, but was interesting"
bad,Good for 20 somethings looking to work long hours on short pay. Older workers are not promoted or retained during layoffs. Managers create stressful situations unnecessarily.
bad,"Hostile take - over. Prior to my employment there, American Tower had just acquired another cell tower real estate company and inherited 100% of its workforce. Those workers who decided to stay, were not happy with the new management and that created tension between the employees especially with temps like me. The senior real estate specialists were rude, impatient and inconsistent with their performance and expectations of me as a new project specialist. I had only a few hours of training and basically had to train myself. Despite all that, I was willing to endure the adversity and strived to make a career at American Tower. I suffered a rear end collision 3 months into my employment with American Tower and had to take a few days off for treatment and diagnostic imaging. Internal memos suggested I would be a permanent employee at the time. While I was at my imaging appointment, my temp agency call and told me that American Tower would not take me on as a permanent employee."
bad,this is a productive work environment although the company focus on productivity results in a sacrifice of a healthy work-life balance.  Many hours of overtime are required in salaried postions.
bad,Very stressful.  My beginning years at American tower great but then slowly it became hard to work there. Every one complains about others. there is no appreciation for handworkers.
bad,I watched American Tower let go of employees that have been with the company for over 15 years like they were not an asset at all. I wish them the best but this is not the environment that I see myself staying in for the long term.
bad,"My time while at American Tower was very strange. I was hired through an outside recruiter (Smartlink LLC) through a very unorganized, rushed process. When I showed up on my first day I was given a completely different position for someone on maternity leave. After three months and they returned, I was given my old position back. Four days later I was fired with no reasoning. I called and emailed my superiors to never receive a response. My temporary contract allowed them to terminate my contract without reason, so it was a life lesson for me. Stay away from Smartlink LLC. They will treat you like garbage."
bad,"When company was smaller, it was a great fit for me.  Unfortunately, it changed from caring about their employees to getting more but paying less.  Management changed and is no longer a good place to work."
bad,Can gain good experience but work environment and management can be improved .Need more interaction between employees and management. Has lot of office politics.
bad,"A empresa possui uma infraestrutura agradável, flexibilidade no horário e uma boa remuneração e benefícios."
bad,"The company is successful and provides good benefits.  However, senior management leads by perception and has a bias against diverse emloyees.  If you do not click with your manager then good performance has no value."
bad,Worked as a contractor for two years.  Contractors and temps were not included in many of the social activities or treated the same as permanent employees.  When my assignment ended I was given a one day notice.
bad,"Nice job culture, mixed. No real stability here at this job. There were many temps that came to this job. Contractors were secluded."
good,"No value on the employee."
good,Great place to work and all the people that work there are fun and efficient. The hardest part of this job was their is too much work for the team they have in place. They have to much work for so little people hire by them.
good,"Fast paced, ever changing, sometimes too much. Fortune 500 REIT that cares about the investors.  Must know how to play the political corporate games.  The employee can at times get lost in the race.  Benefits are great, pay not as much."
good,"I have learned and developed many marketable skills at American Tower.  There are always new challenges and projects to work on so employees often stay busy.  However, pay is below market and there aren't many opportunities for advancement unless you have political / social capital.  This is the type of place where you get ahead based on who you know as opposed to what you can do."
good,"Empresa internacional, onde não é possível intercâmbio de informações entre os países, e muito menos possibilidade de trabalhar na mesma empresa em outros países."
good,This is a good place to work .You do your assignment of the day without any pressure and your peer is willing to answer your question .People are friendly.
good,"It is employees friendly company but promotion policy & increments policy should be recvised"
good,Requires a focus on getting things done. Too much process not enough focus on getting things done. Good business model and good future.
good,"Weaknesses in communication between management levels and in-field, goal-accomplishing levels hindered the process. "
good,This is a fast paced industry and the engineering department has to move at the same pace.  With a large volume of work there isn't a lot of downtime.
good,"buena empresa para aprender y conocer diferentes formas de trabajar, grandes retos, la dirección de sistemas con gran experiencia, proyectos multidisciplinarios y multiculturales,   pero poca inversión en los empleados, poca oportunidad de crecimiento, a pesar de la buena filosofía muchas veces no se aplica en la practica"
good,"It is important to be able to do more with less. However, ATC takes that capability and turns it into a commandment, to the point where it is an end goal in itself to have declining or stagnant resources with ever higher expectations."
good,"typical work days were strenuous and difficult but not ever day was like that. learned several skills in telecommunications, communications, troubleshooting, technical support, problem solving, deductive reasoning, and budgeting.Management fell short in several areas of communication and motivation, when it came to immediate supervisors knowing their positions and what means they can assist you there was a lack of knowledge and experience. Handling the unreasonable work load was the worst experience of this position. demands were heavy and expected to be completed in nearly impossible times or ways. Learning different skills and the co workers were great people to learn from."
good,"Since I was contractor they put me as much as possible of work load, not paying overtime. That means maximum load possible to pay minimum possible. I don't know what else to say"
good,"Great company to work for.  "
good,American Tower is a large telecom infrastructure company that operates in 15 countries all over the world. It has a market capitalization of $60 billion.
good,Challenging work but steady contractual work. management wasn't nice but co-workers were nice.  No chance for promotion or increase in pat
good,ATC es muy dinamica lo cual tiene pros y contra. Lo negativo es que no hay reconocimiento al esfuerzo y dedicacion.
good,The company is ever changing with the industry. We are becoming more of a corporate entity which has taking away from quartly bonus and advacement. The company seems to be going towards a contractor basis instead of hiring & promoting within.
good,Company is good with bonuses and the opportunity for new positions is available. However the pay is very poor compared to average pay of other companies.
good,"Good international company to be employed by but the management structure has it's challenges.  Growth at the company is limited, but working hours are good and they have good benefits."
good,"The work is ok, however the amount of change that happens isn't effective. Also, there is never any direction on what the next steps are. I have learned a great deal about the telecommunications industry as well as project management."
good,"It was such a long time ago I can't recall. What I do recall that the people that I worked with were very pleasant and always willing to help. Great training,"
good,"I cannot comment much since I lost my job due to closing the Boca office.  It was nice while it lasted, there was always an air of uncertainty ever since GTP got bought out by American Tower."
good,The company itself is great to work for. The management in the American Tower NOC is terrible. They are not fair in job promotions. The also do not adhere by the guidelines that are in place for employees set by HR. They are not open to hear opinions from their employees. American Tower is a company wonderful to work for. The Network Operations Center is a dead end unless you are in a lead type of position.
good,"The work was repetitive, and not much energy was invested in its works to help develop skills in industry. Management often dictated work to employees without creating a serious plan of action."
good,"The job provides some valuable experience, but you will quickly max out your personal professional development.  There are very few positions for advancement.  This is not a company where you can rely on getting a promotion simply for putting in your time."
good,"American Tower has great people working for them, but the business practices make for complications in projects that could be avoided.  The IT group is kept in the dark about changes that impact them directly, as the business meets separately and brings IT in at the last minute.  BAs feel they are the ones running the IT projects, instead of the project managers.  Senior level project managers are filling roles that a project coordinator could handle."
good,Have Good Presence in USA & friendly environment to work or learn.
good,resources were readily available. Good variety in projects to work on.
good,Very strong in its industry but constant reorganizations caused confusion and fear with its employees.  Collaboration between departments is very tough and competitive.
good,"a typical work day: it is a fast pace but mostly field workers all over the country."
good,Grande multinacional com problemas de empresa pequena. Bastante intriga entre os gerentes e diretores. Política machista.
good,"Empresa tradicional americana, onde preserva muita a cultura de uma empresa tradicional."
good,Chance for advancement within relationship with upper-management.  All personnel is expected to answer work related calls 24/7 as they pay for personal mobile cell.
good,"Good people, lots of ways to learn from other engineers. Work can be repetitive but is always an evolving challenge to improve your numbers. Numbers are highly valued with this company. Co-workers are nice people. Management likes to hold nearly impossible goals."
good,"Lease Administration entails reviewing leases signed by customers that buy equipment that attach to our towers.  We review them for term, length, rent and equipment.  All this information is uploaded and abstracted into the Oracle database.  A team of 8 abstractors work on tenant contracts and land contracts.  Monthly & Quarterly goals are strived for as well as individual metrics.  Team projects are acquired sites are always a part of day to day operations."
good,"I t was okay I am writing this because I do not feel like writing a whole description about it. Management sucked in Cary, inexperienced incompetent manager for Tower Finance. Her whole team left smh"
good,"I worked there in the spring of 2017 as an analyst. I was disappointed that not everyone hired for a specific position would actually work in that department, which in my case was finance, but I found myself supporting the legal team. It also seemed as though they had a high turnover rate. "
good,"Management supplied all the tools to enable employees to perform their duties reasonably well. American Tower purchased the previous company, so the dynamics/job culture essentially changed"
good,"Management is too distant from lower level employees to understand daily struggles and how unrealistic goals are. Employees are overworked with little appreciation. Since there is constant work, job security is always here, but advancement is difficult unless you play the politics well. When it comes to growing your career, there is little to no help from management."
good,"It is a very productive workplace with a lot of  review culture. Reviews are objective and crisp."
good,American Tower is a growing company. Alot of development is happening and people are nice.
good,"Had very good experience in terms of HR profile,learned and having experiences of working in different parts of states."
good,"This is a stable company, the market has long term future growth. The culture needs improvement. Work a lot of hours. No ability to work from home. Not may opportunities for advancement."
good,"Great company all around but the Dallas, Texas office management was cold and distant at best.  Management needs to work on their people skills and the company, as a whole, needs their offices to be closer to Mass Transit where available.  I had to ride a bike 2 miles to the office from the nearest transit stop for 3 weeks until my car was fixed.  Also, compensation for the transit passes would be awesome.  Other than that, its a fine place to work."
good,"American Tower has gone to great lengths evidently to choose the best and the brightest people available. I worked there temporarily and found everyone to be highly intelligent, conscientious,cooperative, kind, helpful and warm. My job as a temporary tech writer was extremely demanding, and there was a lot to do. One project would often take priority over another, so I had to drop one and pick up the other on a moment's notice."
good,I made my career at this company and enjoyed the people and customers.   The atmosphere was corporate and focused on customer satisfaction but lacked in career development for all employees.
good,Uma das melhores empresa em que trabalhei. Pode conhercer profissionais de altíssimo patamar profisional e de muita qualidade em seu comprometimento. Colaborando assim e aperfeiçoando minha desenvoltura profissional.
good,"A fantastic, profitable company, with great benefits. My own experience was that of a relatively stiff culture that is constantly changing. Sometimes those changes are for the better, others are cumbersome. As a technology based company, the willingness to change is there, but as a publicly traded REIT, those changes can be difficult to effectuate. "
good,Managers will not be open to peers.Management showed a Partiality between VIOM and ATC employees. Viometes are targeted around the office working culture. bosses also behaves different between people.
good,"I enjoyed my job at American Tower. For my group, it was exceptionally fast paced and fairly demanding. I also spent long hours getting the job done (not a complaint but an observation). I enjoyed going to work and had exceptional management team and colleagues."
good,Had to many levels of management and had trouble with work flow. Used older oracle software. Learned a lot about leases and property management. Good stock options if planning on staying with company.
good,A very great place to work constant growth and expansion American tires are great company. I manage all of the West Tennessee is a field operations technician from maintenance to landlord relations to all aspects of the tower industry
good,Director's hire controllable managers who in turn hire unimaginative supervisors who encourage conformity and group-think.  Creativity is not invited.
good,Good company to work for with great benefits. Work culture is positive with lot of opportunities to grow if you are willing to relocate. Additionally it always looks good on resume to work for a Fortune 500 firm.
good,"Great team they had back in 2012, not sure what the team is like now. workplace atmosphere was good and the team were friendly. Great job for an intern."
good,"The work load is steady, and days are productive and you have your own space to avoid distraction. The people are approachable and willing to help you when you need guidance. Great easy-going environment."
good,"ATC fast passed. They compensate well. I gained lots of knowledge about the wireless industry, DAS in particularly. I would return if offered a position."
good,"It was a job you could go and do your job, not be micromanaged, and you were kept busy doing all of the ""boring"" work, but it kept you busy. People were mostly friendly. It was a huge company and you don't exactly get to meet everyone, but the people in my group were nice and we all got along great!"
good,"Competitive benefits, friendly coworkers, and challenging environment."
good,"•	Focus on the quality of work  "
good,"ATC is definitely a great company to work for,  benefits are great, health insurance plan is affordable and top-notch.  However, management will micro-manage if they ""think"" it's necessary.  Creative input is stifled if your manager thinks his or her version of something is better.  Make sure that you check your ego at the door and ask questions about what you're doing and why you're doing it, otherwise you'll be in for a world of hurt."
good,"American Tower is a good company, with good benefits. There is a serious lack of communication between departments which makes it difficult to get your job done."
good,Competitive wages and benefits. Fast paced and energetic company in the growing field of technology.
good,My typical work day is consistent with me leading and directing   the projects that I have due. I am able to work with lots of autonomy  and no pressure or stressful deadlines.
good,"I enjoy working for ATC.  I also enjoy the people I work with and the management.  It suits me, however, it doesn't suit everyone.  Some people who work here find the culture doesn't work well with their personality."
good,"Working on Telecom projects and design."
good,"ATC has matured into a Fortune 500 caliber company and has made progress in evolving a culture that values talent, but is not as competetive as they need to be to retain it."
good,"Collegial and friendly work environment; however not much room for advancement.  "
good,"Typical day consisted of conference calls with construction managers, updating status, ensure equipment status, operation checks of communications equipment and ensuring proper staffing of events.  Unfortunately my contract came to an end.  However, I would welcome another opportunity to work with the teams at American Tower."
good,"I am associate to ATC for last more than 4 years and experiencing great team work & learning many good things as given chance to learn inter departmental workings, interpersonal skills with customers, feedback, vendors etc.. "
good,"- Planning new BTS Wireless sites"
good,A great family oriented company.
good,"A typical workday at American Tower consisted of Staff Meetings, performing your daily routines lunch and going home.The most enjoyable part of the day was working with teams to complete a goal."
good,"Good environment and benefits, however, lacks upward mobility for design employees. Due to company structure work can be very repetitive- get used to doing the same thing everyday."
good,"ATC was a great company to work for.  I spent over 7 years employed at ATC and I do not regret working there.  Unfortunately, the region that I was assigned has a manager who will do anything to get ahead including stepping on people to get ahead."
good,"Great working atmosphere, American Tower cares about their employees and the quality of work outputted. Very much a 9-5 atmosphere and learn great computer and people skills."
good,American Tower has invested globally instead of focusing solely on their US portfolio and this has proved to be a very strategic and worthy investment. They run an efficient office and overall have a healthy culture. The most difficult part of the job was learning the many exceptions to the rules we were to taught to follow. My favorite part of the job was learning more about the wireless industry. I specifically enjoyed learning about the 3g and 4g wireless and where the industry is predicted to go in the near future.
good,"On a typical day I talk to over fifty people inside and outside the company. I sell space on our towers and on our properties to a variety of customers. My role as an account manager has been to sell the value of our real estate. I've learned that just about everything is negotiable; rent, term lengths, yearly escalators and contract language."
good,I really enjoyed my time at American Tower. It was a proactive results based organization and gave great autonomy to its employees.
good,"Aprendes mucho , y existen areas de crecimiento , solo hay que dejar bien los procesos de cada area , para poder repartir actividades equitativamente."
good,"Good people to work with. Typical day involved colocations, tower upgrades, lighting audits, NTP's, and safety. Learned much about the wireless industry."
good,"Great company "
good,"They ""farm out"" a lot of jobs to contract workers.  Unfortunately, there is little hope to advance in your career as a full-time employee, which is stressful.  The pay was fair and I liked my managers."
good,"Empresa americana con muchas expectativas para crecimiento del rubro sin embargo los 2 primeros años no crecio como se tenia proyectado más que nada por la aparición de mucha competencia en la construcción de sitios y menores precios de los competidores."
good,"I enjoyed the level of training and information provided to you- really helped promote your personal and professional growth while educating you about the internal and external process, company goals and ethics encouraged."
good,"My typical day of work starts with casual interaction with all individuals, listening to their concerns which helps me connect better with my employees."
good,"Field works were interesting, had many adventures of traveling to new places and working with multicultural people. Good support and training from the management, especially for budding Engineers"
good,I enjoyed being part of this dynamic team.  American Tower is an amazing thriving company.  I was layed off on 8/1/2017 when the Boca Raton Offices were closed.
good,"Long hours for the pay. Benefits are very good, Norm is to work 9- 10 hour a day and a lot of folks do a lot more. Construction folks live in hotels and on the road for week's at a time."
good,"Being a Contractor, there was no job security. It was a positive work environment, but once my Project was completed, job security became an issue"
good,Large bureaucratic function based company.  Sometimes difficult to get things accomplished.  Some incredibly talented employees who taught me a lot about the wireless business and how important project management can be in a functional type company.
good,American Tower is a good place to work with a happy work life balance. Teamwork is encouraged by upper management.  I have enjoyed my time here.
good,Company was a delight to work for. Any questions that needed answered were addressed quickly. Everyone works very well as a team.
good,"Great place to work. Depending on the department; work life varies. Great pay and benefits, just not so many advances. Hardest part of job being the times of back-to-back calls that do not challenge my troubleshooting skills. So it is a little tedious."
good,It is a very good place to work with very good work culture and management. But as a contractor no Job security.
good,"I work on the Cash Application Team. I take all the Cash that comes in and apply it to the correct invoice. The software we use is Oracle."
good,"Empresa multinacional americana, com valores apoiados na ética e no bem-estar dos funcionários."
good,Good company to work within talented people on board. Workplace is excellent. Friendly enviroment. Poor IT tools.
good,"I had a great experience with Managers and coworkers. All friendly and helpful. American Tower is very easygoing and yet results focused. Also, very family oriented."
good,"it was a good experience with ATC, I have learned many new things from my senior colleges & manager & implement those learning things on my work for the growth of organization & mine."
good,"Good place to work with good benefits but salaries are not competitive. Challenging work with opportunities to work on innovative projects, but limited opportunity for advancement."
good,"Good benefits, pay could be better. Typical corporate environment. Depending on which office you are located at it will be a different experience. Stock is a huge plus."
good,Empresa dedicada con sus clientes en el sector de telecomunicaciones
good,"A typical workday was very busy and learned about tower leasing, for wireless and broadcast companies.The culture was great with a lot of shared company activities. Management was generally excellent except Managers would overstep each other. There was a reorganization almost every year which could disrupt the sales cycle and selling techniques. Honestly the commute was hardest part of the job. Seeing a customer installed and operational on the tower was the most rewarding part of the job."
good,"Experiences may vary depending on which part of the business you work, and your specific function.  "
good,When I work at ATC I was only responsible for myself.  I worked out of my home and they provided me with everything I need to get my job done.  I was a great place to work for someone that like to self manage.
good,"I have overseen all aspects of wirelessODAS & IDAS builds and learned several types of equipment used for the build in the industry. "
good,"Evaluate M&A opportunities, build financial model, arrive at fair valuation and submit non-binding offer. Prepare deck to take approval from the Investment Committee"
good,"My job is to process incoming business applications from various companies to install new equipment, or modify existing technical equipment at American Tower owned sites.  This required me to learn a great deal about the cell tower industry and its subtleties, as well as numerous interconnected ATC programs and systems used to complete the applications.  Data integrity is paramount in this business, so a great attention to detail and a knowledge of technical/engineering equipment was necessary. "
good,"Empresa muito boa para se trabalhar."
good,Learn so much on this project support American Tower Employees all over the world. Picked up great desktop support skill and the work environment was great.
good,"They pay well, the upper management is sincere, fun and smart. They do care about employee. it is a small company in the sense of number of people everybody knows everybody type."
good,Each department collaborated with other efficiently to get the job done. Great work environment with company functions to interact with team members. Annual holiday parties and picnics are examples of events designed to develop team cohesiveness.
good,Typed invoice payments and reviewed contracts. We were in a merger. The most difficult was collecting contracts from prior companies to centralize into our new system
good,"Empresa muito boa para se trabalhar. "
good,the company was great. small but great benefits. would work there again. the culture was well balanced. benefits were great as well. management was well trained.
good,"Great company with excellent benefits.  As with any large company focus is more streamlined to where you do a lot of a specific task, whereas a smaller company one tends to do many different tasks and involvement in many areas is more prevalent."
good,"Overall a good to work with in todays tough telecom scenario."
good,"I participated in the annual provision process and the compliance process."
good,"Ambiente agradable de trabajo, gente colaboradora, mucha coordinación con la casa matriz, y muchos procesos que se pueden mejorar hace que uno siempre tenga actividades por realizar"
good,"É uma empresa multinacional, e portanto a responsabilidade aumenta, entretanto, isso não torna o ambiente ruim. A gerência das áreas e todos os funcionários são abertos, educados e comunicativos. A parte mais difícil do trabalho é a carga por ser uma empresa de grande porte, mas isso não é aparente, uma vez que se trabalha com pessoas agradáveis"
good,Excellent company to work for. Very organized with a professional approach to task completion. Training program for full time Construction Managers is heads and shoulders above the majority of other companies in the same line of work. Only negative issue is the tasking is market driven and job security is a constant worry.
good,"Very spontaneous job, I love that part of it.  My manager is awesome.  Her management style was very refreshing in this day and age of the matrix.  I had clear direction and the tools and space to do my job and produce results."
good,"Great opportunities to learn."
good,I had the opportunity to learn the tower side of telecommunications while learning a new skill set.
good,American Tower is dedicated to appeasing their employees.  They believe in the work/life balance and offer many special perks to show their appreciation to their employees.
good,"The Atlanta office is a relatively small office and quiet which I admire. Contractors are often treated as 2nd class citizens but full time employees are not rude.  Overall, it is a good company and your direct superior makes it enjoyable to work there."
good,The most enjoyable part of my work is the instant difference that my work makes on the ability of my colleagues to deliver on their jobs.If a user's Microsoft office is having issues and he cannot deliver on a project that he is working on due to this problem then once such a computer is brought to IT support and the issue resolve therefore the user becomes empowered and instantaneously.start delivery on his job.
good,"I do not feel the need to write a review, it is not very important nor would it be helpful since everyone has there own opinions and day to day  tasks."
good,"Ótimos benefícios, boa cultura coorporativa. Alguns processos são um pouco obsoletos e acabam prejudicando a empresa em comparação aos concorrentes mais novos."
good,"1. Growing MNC which believes in giving growth opportunities to it's employees."
good,"Great Company.  Company strives to work by core values, hire great , hard working, fun employees."
good,"It is a great company. There is opportunity to move around and learn other parts of the business and grow through some great training. There are many employees that have been there for 10 plus years so they are doing something right. Can be a little bureaucratic at times causing delays. "
good,"Es una compañia con mucho potencial creciendo mucho, excelente equipo de Recursos Humanos a nivel internacional que hace que cada País se preocupe por las personas, por tener un excelente clima organizacional, balance vida y trabajo."
good,"Non-stressful days"
good,Great place to work. Company culture is focused and relaxed. Everyone seems happy to work here. Everybody wants you to succeed and are helpful. Not sure about career growth though.
good,This was a great job to start my career in the legal profession. Management was always available to assist with whatever was needed. The people were friendly and it was a friendly atmosphere.
good,"Worked there for 16 years. Met many a great folks along the way. Loved the FOT position. It was awesome to be able to go do your work and get home to your family, which is sometimes hard to find in the telecom business."
good,"good company to start your career, cooperative management, co workers and learning atmosphere."
good,LOVE working at ATC. I would love to work there again if the positions that are moving to Boston came back to ATL. The managers are more like family and the office culture is like no other company I have worked for.
good,It’s a good company to work for with great people and great benefits. The culture is positive and the people are friendly. It is worth experiencing fast pace industry.
good,Resigned after 8 years culture was unacceptable  no management assistance.  Managed West Coast with no support.  No room for growth. Resigned due to this.

good,"American Tower Corporation is 1st in its industry and a great place to work. Salary is competitive and the work/life balance is acceptable. Like any other corporation, they will not hesitate to lay you off if it's in their interest to do so, but they will try to find you an alternate position if one is available. If not, the package they offer is on par with the industry average. ATC is growing at an accelerated rate and there's plenty of work for everyone. US operations are slowing down as the US becomes saturated with cell towers and tower portfolios are consolidated; however, ATC's international presence is growing almost daily which will ensure they continue to meet analyst projections for growth for many years to come. The best thing I can say about ATC is that I would not hesitate to work there again should the opportunity present itself."
