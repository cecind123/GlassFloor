rating,review
bad,"Even if you meet all your stats, management will ""find"" a way to bring them down in order for you to not advance in the company. This will end up being the worst choice of employment. Stay away."
bad,I wouldn't recommend it if it was the last place to work! There’s nothing but jealous employees who sits around and talk about each other behind they backs then have the nerve to want to be your friend. You have to literally watch your back and your every move. You have the employees who talk back to the managers and still they have a job. This place is SO unorganized and SO unprofessional
bad,"I have no relation with Sentry Insurance and never worked for them. This question/item mixup must be a software glitch. Sentry reference is in error, a mixup of information."
bad,Unfortunately this is a really bad place to work unless you are white male. A typical day for myself and most of the people I knew involved being micromanaged and yelled at in front of co-workers. If your manager did not support you then you would not be promoted or even transferred to another department. Your education and work ethic does not matter here.
bad,It's been over 15 years since working for this company. I do not feel that leaving a review on the company would be reasonable. I did leave due to poor management and moving out of the state.
bad,Located in the colder climates of wisconsin... The office is very small but brings in a lot of revenue.... The people are nice but they could well do and better invest in better facilities
bad,They hire inexperience managers and think they can belittle you. HR will do nothing about it. Everything is a manual process and expect you to live at work to make goals. Company is a sweat shop and give them about six months to stay in business.
bad,"I would not recommend this job to most due the stress level, poor management, low office moral and getting screamed at every day by your insured, claimants, managers, body shop owners, etc."
bad,the leadership staff is not professional and lack integrity. the company have a high turnover with staff due to lack of leadership.
bad,micro managers. they are more concerned with adjusters completing administrative screens than settling cases. EXTREMELY high stress. pay is terrible. they are based in WI and think everyone should be paid based on WI standard of living.
bad,"Never work for this company unless you like to curse, yell, threaten, and be rude to customers on the phone. "
bad,"The trainer belittled me on a daily basis anytime I asked a question about the lesson.  Before the   End of my first week, she had made me cry three times, and it had gotten to the point where I was scared to even ask a question when I was confused about something in the lesson I just kept quiet.  I was so confused, because I know I didn’t do anything wrong. I would have every screen up exactly where it was up on the  projector following along, if I asked a question for example, she would tell me and I’m not paying attention, I’m not listening to her, and when I tried to explain that I was following along Word for Word, so me I’m a liar  and that I’m the only one confused. Right after I asked a question, (never get the answer to it) Someone next to me would ask the same question, and she answered to them like they’re best friends.  It definitely did one on my ego that’s for sure.  This company is a joke and I see now why there are rumors that they’re going out of business. I hope they do, or get new management  and a new trainer/lesson plan,  what they have going is clearly  not working."
bad,its a call center yeah you get paid good but its a horrible enviorment to work at. you get treated horrible not only by the customers but by your boss as well. no good training and god for bid you ask for more or help then you pretty much get looked at like your dumb and they find a way to fire you
bad,"Responsible for dissemination of information to parties involved in an automobile accident (Including explanation of coverage, rights and responsibilities, and options for handling their damage claim/injury)"
bad,"Employees are expected to keep their heads down and work through breaks.  Senior management has no work-life balance; therefore, the staff is expected to display this same devotion without equivalent monetary benefit."
bad,"Sentry Insurance likes to brag that they are a Midwest Company with Midwest conservative values. Well, their current product offerings reflect this. In no way, shape or form is anything ""cutting edge."" The technology was recently updated from an old mainframe and is still based on using function keys. "
bad,"The management is nothing but a group of elitist snobs who protect each other, even when one of theirs is incompetent. Top heavy upper management, all VP's and Directors who spend their days beating down the underlings. Insurance offered to employees under an imaginary discount is twice the price the employees can get it elsewhere for full price. People are leaving every day- company culture is to hide their departing."
bad,"Management  department are one sided decision making and do not support their unit or co-workers. Director is not open minded  or has open door policy. Director does not back or support his employee's."
bad,The training you get is ridiculous! I was promised extra training and extra help over and over but instead of getting help I got fired. Walked out after working most of the day. Treated like a criminal. I wasn't even allowed to grab any of my belonging's on my desk! In all my life I have never been let go of a job! I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone!
bad,No respect. Unappreciative. Vacation days given was appropriate. Benefits also a plus. Lots of games and begging for money one way or another for whatever their cause was.
bad,"Run from this company!  The work is completely unmanageable, and there is no support.  In an office of 45 people, they have had over 20 people quit in the last year."
bad,"Decades of work and saved the company millions during the course of my career, only to be let go a couple years before qualifying for early retirement.  Sentry is notorious for massive terminations every 5-10 years,  and goes after those with the highest pay,  most earned vacation,  and a pension (which no longer exists),  and replace these knowledgeable and experienced employees with low paid inexperienced younger candidates.  They try to look good in the public eye,  but all they've done for years is cut benefits and pay."
bad,"This company is racist!!! They do not hire african americans, so if  you hate wworking with african americans.. This is the job for you!!!"
bad,"RMS is a very poorly run and archaic company.  The culture promotes doers and not thinkers.  "
bad,"For a claims representative its a good stepping stone, problem is in this location there is nowhere else to go; Sentry has an excellent business model locating several offices in locations where they're the only game in town...in other words, you're stuck."
bad,"On an average day you would take anywhere between 100 to 130 calls. the management sucked. ( esp if you had an ice queen as your boss ) your co workers kept you sane ( if you didnt have to sit by the older ones ) other than that, you were just a underpaid over worked insurance agent. "
bad,No matter what you do management is never happy. They ride your butt daily while coworkers they do like can do what ever they want and get away with it. Supervisors and upper management will talk very nasty to you and threaten you that they will walk you out the door. You have to work through your breaks and lunch to meet their expectations and then that's not good enough. Couldn't wait to get out of there so glad I am!
bad,"I worked for this company and this is not the kind of environment you want to work in. I worked in field sales and there was over a 90% turnover. This has continued because of poor management. If you are looking to work in the insurance business, there are a number of good companies to work for. This is not one of them."
bad,"I would not refer my enemy to work there. They have a high turn around, high pendings and low pay. Management does not care about their employee's. They only think of themselves. HR is even worse. Nothing is confidential."
bad,"Former employee at sentry. The job itself is stressful taking over 120 calls a day and not being able to take a bathroom  break or even step out for some fresh air, without some running behind you to tell you to get on the phones. The managers show favoritism and are racist. If your not one of their kind don’t expect for any advancement. They open positions for people of their kind. While others that’s been working their well over 10 years are still in a Customer Service ll positions. There’s no hope for a career a this place. It’s really just a job. They have ever changing policies everyday they expect you to remember with two and a half days of training. Your hours to work change everyday, you will not have no set schedule. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE."
bad,"The only thing that will keep you sane working for sentry, are your co-workers!"
bad,"Worked there for 6.5 years. Had virtually no chance for learning new technologies although I asked in every review. Research, analysis, and documentation are non-existent. Open floor concept is extremely distracting."
bad,"Treated as high school students due to two people committing an illegal act. Instead of firing them, an entire department was punished and one person that admitted to committing this illegal act was promoted."
bad,way to much stress /pressure  put on you with out proper tools to exceed .no help to hit goals  .hardest  part is working with people that cant be trusted
bad,Company can not decide in which direction it wants to go. It has changed its' focus over the last 10 years to go so many different ways. It finally shut down its auto and home division a few months ago with absolutely no notice to its affected employees.
bad,Be prepared to walk out on friday with a job and walk in monday to be told you have been dismissed for no reason. Claims department turnover is between 30 and 35% every six months and there's no give and take with the company. Scheduling is stiff as a board and does not work with you around specific situations or even doctor appointments (you have to fight for every hour of non-availability). The people who work with you directly such as managers and co workers are wonderful people who are kind and genuinely want you to do well but the ones you don't work with could care less. All in all not somewhere you want to work from the bottom up in as a company.
bad,Claims Rep - work from home. Not worth it! Don’t do it!  It may seem like a good idea- it’s not. Expect to be micromanaged by Supervisors who don’t handle claims and haven’t worked Claims in years. Expect to work 50-60 hours a week to keep up.
bad,Responsible for inbound non-standard auto and motorcycle insurance. At the time of interview was promised a regular Monday thru Friday schedule with an occasional Saturday but found out after training that there would be no weekends off. Everyone is scheduled to work Saturday. You might get one weekend off every four to five weeks. Management has their favorites which are internal transfers from customer service because the position is more customer service ordering taking.There's no work life balance and enforce work place professionalism and boundaries.
bad,"They will take you away from your phone to have a 1-hour meeting about how you are not answering the phone enough.  Silly immature games for ""motivation""."
bad,Workplace culture depends on who you report to.  Worked for a boss who was horrible and created a hostile work environment.  Was finally able to transfer to a different department reporting to a manager who valued me.
bad,"During the time I was there, there were so many people quitting that it became a challenge to get one's work done without a lot of overtime. Also, claims were assigned to adjusters above their level of experience."
bad,The management is negative and counter productive. Criticism is frequent and arbitrary while suggestions for improvement are ignored. Management rules rather than guides and encourages.
bad,IT department is not that organized. Everyone has to work extra to meet the agressive deadlines.
bad,"Company isn't employee friendly, micromanaged from Stevens Point, WI"
bad,"Because of cut down sizing, this company has went through a lot of cut backs over the past few years. This has caused the remaining employees to have to drive further and work harder to try and cover the same area. Between ever increasing demand from the management staff and having to answer questions from the dim whited Underwriters, the field staff are not able to service the customers."
bad,"The most stressful place I have ever worked.  The hours are long.  The workload per adjuster is crazy.  The adjuster salary looks great, until you realize the amount of hours and stress that go with it."
bad,"This employer will require more and more of you, without compensation, depriving your family of your presence and guidance, only to remove your position to replace 1 benefited employee with 2 nonbenefitted part-time employees."
bad,"The number of claims received is large. You are expected to make first contact within 24 hours, but you are expected to answer all of your incoming calls. "
bad,"Out of touch with reality, no direction, very noncompetitive issues, autocratic management style, run by people who should not be in management positions because it is all about company earnings period. If I would have known how much time I wasted at this company, I never would have stayed as long plus a few years from early retirement, they get rid of people-a lot of people. They make a lot of money but do not care at all about employees, stay away from this outfit, will get rid of people with no thought or conscience. Basically afraid of their own shadow."
bad,"Awful management in most areas, very out of touch with the realities of what it takes to get their ""big ideas"" to work on the timeline they need to meet to get a bonus. Tip: a new work space and new cafeteria are nice, but please don't think it will make up for not receiving basic appreciation and good old fashioned respect for a job well done. Plus, it might benefit the company a little when shooting that recruiting video, eh?"
bad,"This box can't contain my review, or my vigor. Our customers are terrifying people."
bad,I repeatedly asked for additional training. They gave us one portion of a week and put us on the phones. They waited too long to review calls so errors stacked up without the ability to correct mistakes before it was too late.
bad,"Selling business insurance, life insurance and 401k.  Products priced higher than competition made for difficult selling.  Good branch manager, but regional manager a very angry person tough to work for."
bad,"Crazy and chaotic, the management team is trying to learn a business that is constantly changing due to governmental regulation.  Current infrastructure cannot support business operations."
bad,typical day at work was filling out papers for underwriters
bad,"This is a great position from the standpoint that the company furnishes you with everything that you need to be successful...computers, printers, support, marketing materials, a car, gas, cell phone allowance.  Training is not real plentiful initially.  Pressure is put on you quickly to perform and meet goals.  Changes were over-bearing.  New computers, new data software, new procedures, changes in policy, changes in products, management changes....all in 2 years....makes it difficult to keep up.  This is a great company, with great products, and a great reputation.  However, the top management of this company are screwing it up.  This is a company that definitely doesn't care if you are employed there or not."
bad,"I worked did my job, but they were always looking for ways to write you up or to try to make you not get a raise. The bonus plans the raises were short as possible. The main office had a gold coarse, exercise rooms and restaurants and bars, it was a very very click type of a place."
bad,"The highest level of management has allowed some areas to embrace a culture of don't question or be considered having the wrong attitude. Those with the ""right attitude"" will advance almost effortlessly. Favoritism runs rampant. Some, not all, but some management has a ""do as I say not as I do"" management style while others lead by intimidation rather than example. The point is, be careful what area you apply in. Talk to people. Sentry's benefit and compensation package is phenomenal so be aware that once you're in, it's very difficult to give up that financial stability even though you may dread going to the job every day because of the atmosphere you are forced to work in...or be forced out. Again, this is not the case in all areas so just do your homework before you apply. Don't go for just anything to get in the door. It could end up being a big mistake."
bad,"Reverse is overall a decent company, just needs new management"
bad,"When you are new - management is full of compliments- Management goes with the strengths of the employee- if you are a hard efficient worker you will get more than your fair share of work, while the select few BS around the office. If you question anything the thumbs come done on you. Do not use the open door policy. Management is not ashamed to make up/skew incidents to process anyone out. Good news- if you sign on the dotted line - they will not fight your unemployment benefits. If you just want to come in on time, do your job to the best of your ability, avoid malicious gossip, and go home to live your life- Sentry is not the place for you. If you like to meander in, talk trash about your co-workers, play golf, and complain about how over worked you are and not produce-then you will thrive with this attitude...."
bad,"Sentry uses its location and lack of competition to its advantage, in other words they will flat out ask you where else you think you can go in Central WI that's better.  "
bad,"Poor management, nepotism and favoritism to advance.  Policies change constantly and you dont have a set schedule, even for lunches or brakes.  Objectives and scoring unfair, usually managers have favorites, and it is like a microcosm of favoritism and. nepotism."
bad,"The company throws money at you because the company knows that it is lacking in all other aspects of employment. There is no culture, and they make promises they cannot keep. They do not pride themselves in providing their employees a work/life balance."
bad,Working at Sentry is about the quantity not the quality of work. This is now part of the Corporate Culture which does not take kindly to thinking outside of the box or against the grain. If you are a free thinker and question processes and controls to management then I would not recommend a career at Sentry. They preach one message in their employee training but do not follow through with the way employees are handled.
bad,"A great place to work, BUT....the work load is very unrealistic especially when compared to the salary level.  They are trying to get better work flows, but more work continues to be piled on to the people they know who can finish it.  In the meantime, people who do next to nothing have no additional work.  It is VERY uneven.  "
bad,The culture and ever changing systems used in claims make it hard to keep up and surprisingly enough I was only there a year and was the second most senior employee for my department. This being my first claims job not able to compare it to any thing else but I never worked harder for a company and still was let go.
bad,"Plenty of over-time, no room for growth, unorganized for a call center environment"
bad,Managers aren't subtle about favoritism due to close friendships with those that report to them. This leads to targeting and picking apart everything you do. Supposed to work as team but a lot of backstabbing
bad,"Close to home and relaxed dress code.  Alot of nice people work there but if you know someone in management, it is always a plus."
bad,It was ok.I really have nothing to say about this job. It paid bills. Not your average call center.
bad,A typical day at work would be dealing with various clients insureds and not claimants making sure the best customer services is given.
bad,i dont think sentry insurance understands that the employees are not just a number and we are actual people. they need to get something new to help with this issue
bad,"On the whole, this is not a bad company. They have historically been willing to listen to issues from the field, but at some point one wonders if the plan all along was to listen and not actually change. "
bad,"I worked at Sentry for 3 years and initially was very impressed but came to realize how dysfunctional the company truly was. When I first joined, the company seemed to embrace me and what I had to offer. This changed radically as they attempted to downsize and many very good people got caught in the crossfire and were let go. People that had worked there 20+ years were released and escorted out of the building leaving fewer of us to still perform the same amount of work."
bad,"Loved my job. I do not understand the concept they use to hire managers and supervisors. I know they like ""yes men"" and they got them. However, the intelligence of these managers/supervisor is lacking quite abit. No longer with the company. Happy and I will never look back. Love the company, great benefits, some nice geniune people however they need to revamp the thought process of so call managers/supervisors."
bad,"I was personally employed in the Claims Department for over a year and a half. The job itself is endless and you will always have work to do which makes the day go quickly. However, the work environment is fairly negative. You're dealing with customers, agents, companies, etc., in a high stress environment and that can quickly filter into all of your work colleagues. If you are not able to tell people no and be direct this is not the job for you. The benefits and pay are acceptable to the job you are working and if you work hard your bonuses and pay will reflect that. It can feel isolating at times as you are on the phone 90% of the day."
bad,"Sentry is going through many changes and does not seem to be looking to keep its direct writer strategy too much longer. Half of the sales force was recently laid off. If you are a business lucky enough to get a Sentry insurance policy, it’s because they don’t think you will have claims. They do not put their customers first and make sure to tell the sales force that their job is to protect the company."
bad,Decent place to work but no real advancement path. Management is somewhat chaotic.
bad,"High turnover. If you ""don't get it"" after training you will be fired and your tasks/claims will be given to your already overworked coworkers. Some employees have been fired for very little while others remain- obviously due to favoritism. Some employees walk around and talk all day and can't keep up. If you sit at your desk all day and do keep up, you will be expected to do more work and help the lazy employees. Poor management leads to outbursts at the end of the month to ""make the numbers"". The key to advancement is to be liked or ""favored"". The pay is good but the environment kills your spirit."
good,Worked there for over a decade.  Loved my coworkers but management (mainly the higher up VPs) ONLY care about the $$$$ NOT the employees!!  Immediate supervisors were fine but have to do what they are told from above.  Sentry claims to care about their people - that's a lie!!  They care about upholding a fancy image!  Unfortunate how newer management can make a good company into a bad career decision.
good,over 300+ files per desk which were multi state and heavily litigated.  Attorneys litigated the files especially in Texas vs the adjuster.  Lack of inhouse training by attorneys who were on retainer.
good,"It was hardly ever busy. I have learned how to use the copy machine and filing. Management kept to themselves and there were no motivations. The manager would be gossiping and talking with her favorite employees. My co-workers kept to themselves and never interacted with other workers. The hardest part about this job was that I never was taught on working with a co-worker of mine or I was never taught on how to work multiple telephone lines, which I wanted to learn more or even get into management. The most enjoyable part was I have gotten to work alone and if ever I needed answers I would ask management."
good,"Quality regional insurer. Work is engaging for this type of company. Management is not as caring as they portray themselves to be.. Nonetheless, plenty of good people work here.,"
good,"company trains well, but job environment is not productive. Do not get employee input in decisions. hours are not planned as they should be and the supervisors are not people oriented."
good,"Great compensation package. Wonderful employees and excellent training, but ultimately too much work. Left because there was not enough work-life balance."
good,"It's ok. Not a positive environment and quite monotonous. I learned much about liability and insurance, but it was quite stressful. There were many things I did not agree with in making liability decisions..."
good,With Sentry you have to understand that the type of job it is is face pace. If you are not willing to take on a lot of additional work and not willing to work over the regular 8 hours a day this is not the job for you.
good,"Great place to work if you are looking for advancement in Claims, IT or Data Analytics. Progressive company with good benefits. Expectations for the number of hours managers work is extreme - average of of 55 hours per week depending on which area of the company you work in. Pressure from upper management for excessive time and financial commitments to local not-for-profit organizations."
good,Not what I expected at all. Promised learning opportunities and room for growth for years. I have yet to see either. I honestly believe that management is holding me as the key player in his department
good,"Sentry is a big company in a small town.  Promotions are often granted based on who your parent, grandparent, aunt/uncle etc. is.  Therefore, many people were in positions they were not qualified for which made for a difficult working environment when your boss is an idiot."
good,"There are many areas of Sentry Insurance that I have heard many good things about... positive environment, room for advancement, quality management, and more.  BUT, the retirement plan department, which is often hiring, is not one of those areas.  Most of the managers are sub-par... favoritism, micro-managing, harassment, constant negativity, and sometimes outright deception.  (I will admit that a couple of the managers in this department are the exact opposite... but they have limited authority.)  The moral in this department is about as low as it can get."
good,"The management staff is wonderful at this job, but if you aren't political you will never move up the ranks. It is very difficult to make a name for yourself and or advance from your desk."
good,Working and promoting a reverse mortgage servicer; development and training of foreclosure and bankruptcy teams to ensure reduction of curtailment; hiring and terminating employees within the organization; teambuilding; ensuring first legal is met; audit and compliance review of third party vendors; troubleshooting; the one person everyone goes to for help with issues related to the organization as a whole; communication skills within and outside the corporation at speaking events
good,"I enjoyed working at Sentry, however there was a clear divide between ""old culture"" and ""new culture."" It was very clear that the ""old culture"" still held precedence over the ""new culture."""
good,"Sentry management can be harsh and overbearing. The culture is one of management by the numbers, resulting in high turn over, and most claims people on prescribed anti-depressant, anti-anxiety medication. Adjusters are assigned about 50% more claims than most can comfortably handle."
good,"Nothing good or bad to write about the company."
good,They provide great claims training that is respected in the industry. Get your experience and training here and move on to other companies that offer greater flexibility and pay. That being said the people there are friendly and I made lifetime friendships there.
good,"Good Place to learn quickly and cut your teeth, benefits, especially those at the home office are very cushy.  but theres less opportunity for upward movement.   leadership by fiat is the norm."
good,"Heavy claim loads, high expectations from management. Managers socialize during work time when they could be assisting their employees to train better."
good,"Working for Sentry can be great, if you have good management support. Sadly, not all managers meet this level of expectation. Sentry HR will sadly always stand behind management which allows managers who are able to say the right things make an awful work environment for individuals not liked by the manager."
good,This employeer is no longer working in the Stevens Point area. While they were here they were a good company.
good,"Sentry Insurance is an interesting employer of safety and loss control consultants. The position allows increasing knowledge of manufacturing, dealerships and varied industries that give a wide view of products and services provided by U.S. businesses. The amount of travel is somewhat extreme and the work load is heavy and does not allow a good work-family balance, more time is spent travelling and completing reports, but the positive is the ability to work with businesses from small to Corporate size and assist with their safety program development."
good,"An average corporate environment at Sentry Insurance, and that is really all I have to say about this company, as this system forces a 150 character count."
good,"Very stable company "
good,"I decline to review this company.  It should not be necessary to review my current employer in order to apply for a new position elsewhere.  This is not a requirement, and never should be."
good,"Investigate auto claims"
good,"I received a great deal of knowledge about auto, home and commercial lines insurance coverage. When i started my manager was great to work for, however he had to relocate."
good,"Very much enjoyed learning the ""other side of the fence"" as a bodyshop manager, now adjuster, So much experience and knowledge that will last and has last forever."
good,At Sentry they changed the way they did business. I was an agent for them that worked out of my home. It was a flexible job which I liked but they moved all of there agents in house to corporate so they cut the outside agents.
good,"This company is very micro managed with strict time management guidelines which are nearly impossible to adhere to in the call center. You are basically stuck to a phone cord for 8 hours a day problem solving and listening to people yell at you, all while being recorded and graded on your calls."
good,I was able to work on bodily injury claims for the first time.  I used that experience to pursue my claims career further.  The job got tough when employment was cut and I was able to find a better position.
good,"If you want to live in Stevens Point, WI, this is a great place to work.  If you're willing to learn and put in extra time, you will be given opportunities to advance.  The case load can be overwhelming, and organization skills are a must."
good,"Rather not explain, due to release because of diagnosis of cancer.  State company is willing to work with you due to illness, then releases you from your duties."
good,"Its a typical office job, but they will hire you for a job and then require you to take on duties above your pay grade/knowledge without compensation."
good,"The company has been through a lot of changes and has had 2 presidents since I started in 2014.  The company is more ""mom and pop"" than a fully functioning mortgage company."
good,Everyday is stressful because all aspects of the company are disorganized. Most supervisors play favorites and do not treat people fairly.
good,Working for Reverse Mortgage Solutions was a good place to gain experience with a reputable company. Its Especially good for resume building. The pay is poor though.
good,"Sentry believes in making the employees life easier they offer banking car care, medical care, and fitness all on campus. The management works in levels so you may be in constant contact with your leads and supervisors you are not likely to have much contact with your department managers. I dealt mostly with employees indirectly helping customers and mailing, but there were plenty of opportunities for me to be able to take classes for other departments. Moving up was not always easy to do."
good,The most challenging and wonderful part of this job was working with the customers on loss mitigation options.  Reverse mortgages present a issue when the borrower passes away and the family has a connection to the property.  Working with the families was a heart felt wonderful experience.  The team is amazing and the people are as close as a family could be.
good,"Daily activities included prompt, efficient investigation and handling of claims to resolution, including setting appropriate reserves to making proper liability evaluations. I enjoyed the people I worked with and learned about the civil laws of various states."
good,"This is a good company to work for. The CP manager is a little over bearing and not a good people manager, but the company is ran good from the top."
good,"A typical day was set priorities for the day. Plan your work, work your plan. Prospect for customers, follow up on potential customer and current customers. Take applications and processed paperwork to have a policy issued. In contact with Manager on a weekly basis. I learned to hon my skills my as a salesman and most of all when it comes to people buying products whether it's a car or insurance they were not very trusting. You had to earn their trust. My co-workers were a great group of people who were team players. Always available to help and share their experiences. The hardest part of the job was when there were no customers to talk to on a daily basis. You felt like you didn't accomplish much if you didn't make at least one appointment that day. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you made and appointment and sold a policy(s)."
good,Great entry level job. Benefits and PTO are fair and they do strive for work life balance. Job is demanding and requires high level multitasking skills. Upper management sometimes is clueless on how their decisions affect employees
good,"Typical day at work you have to take at least 80 to 100 call.  Deals with a lot of difficult people and no matter what do you do there alwayssomething to mark down. The hardest part of the job you have to take care of the call, send email do follow up to the customer all at the same time during the call.  The good thing about the company is there a lot a great people willing to help you."
good,"It was a wonderful experience. I enjoyed the environment. Stressful at times but the rewards out weighed the work stress. You were definitely treated with respect, rewards and money for doing your job. It's to bad they sold the division."
good,"A typical day was non stop from beginning to end in the first year. Plenty of overtime, healthy, laidback environment.  My co-workers are like family.  I've worked with most of them for over 10 years.  Work gets done but no overly stressful."
good,When i am on work i enjoy my work and i have learn team lead experience .
good,"Working at Sentry was a mixed bag.  They were very flexible and allowed me to do whatever I needed for my personal life.  I worked in the home office so I had access to a clinic, physical therapist, auto garage, and gym onsite.  I got the feeling they really want to give their employees the extra perks.  The benefits are very good and they don’t make you wait (if you are hired as a regular employee) to receive them.  My pay was much too low, but when I got the job I wasn’t in a position to be picky (lay-off)."
good,"Its a good place to work if all you have is to go to work. For me the training was not that great, the schedule is only consistent for 2 weeks then changes are made. During my interview process I was told that they would work with my school schedule but when I started school they gave me trouble with it and also reduced my hours. I liked the pay but the location, training, and non flexibility is was drove me away."
good,"Thought I made a good career choice, and enjoyed my time for the most part.  My supervisor was okay, but the others would not give you the time of day and seemed elitest.  Can be very cliquey, and the people who should have been reprimanded for behavior or attutdes had seniority or were tenured. I was blindsided, let go for being ""underqualified"", yet was never given a chance to become qualified.  Kept someone who had no experience (just had a better college degree) over myself with experience in the area.  Think long and hard about going here."
good,Compensation and benefits are great. Management does not offer much help for struggling associates. Paid training at headquarters in Wisconsin. Great headquarters.
good,"time stamping completed insurance forms, sorting and delivering mail, faxes, and files to correct departments.  Answering phones, delivering supplies, maintaining fax machines and copiers."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Sentry. I enjoyed my coworkers tremendously however they company did not reward teamwork, if anything it punished it.  It had very flexible schedules however the hours could be very long and extensive which made it difficult for work/life balance.  Workload can be very stressful."
good,"Management is good and they are willing to work with you, have to be focused and committed, if you like to challenge yourself like I do this is the place for you."
good,"The work environment is fast paced on some days, typically on Mondays, and slow on other days."
good,"My job required extensive travel that involved overnight stays.  For the most part, remote employees can become invisible to the company.  OK if you like to work alone."
good,"It has been a challenging role I have taken on with RMS.  Re-writing the entire credit policy for a large company to update current guidelines that have not been touched since 2013 to include rolling out the biggest change to the product line issued by HUD in the entire history of the HECM product at the same time.   The hardest part of this job was trying to fit that major task along with my other duties inside a time frame in order to maintain a work home balance.  It was impossible to achieve these high expectations without working a 16 hour day.  "
good,I enjoyed working there and learned a lot but there was no training and it was sink or swim.  My last Supervisor was very gout the pay was not very good for the industry
good,"Sentry Insurance is a highly productive company with great people. The biggest downside would be the lack of overtime pay, as hours would go very much beyond the 40-hour work week."
good,Generally a good environment to work in. A basic 9-5 type job. I learned some of the in and outs of basic mortgage industry practices. The managements quality varied greatly depending on department. I found my coworkers to be very friendly. The hardest part of the job was dealing with turnover in management. The most enjoyable part of the job was easily the atmosphere in the workplace.
good,"For most of my 25 years, it was a great opportunity to build a career. I was able to advance from a field sales representative through a variety of management and sales leadership roles."
good,"I have great management and I work from home, these are the best things about my job. Sentry has plenty of opportunity for advancement. The workload is extremely high, not enough staff to handle all the work."
good,"Overall, not a bad place to work...if you do not have any family issues arise.  Management was not supportive to work/life balance.  Home office is cool."
good,"I managed a large book of large fleet business which involved executive management discussion and approval, however, was able to work independently to get my job done."
good,"The company is good to work for if you choose to stay in the same position.  It is difficult to move out of your department without connections, especially if you are good at what you do.  The company offers very nice benefits for their associates."
good,Company strongly supports you to provide the best to your clients. Constantly provides education and training along with great marketing opportunities to increase your exposure in area
good,Employer of choice in Freeport Illinois.   Customer Service and Operations departments as well as IT user acceptance testing.  The culture in the Freeport office is supportive and encouraging.
good,"fast paced,great people,great management,challenging and fun. Always looked forward to coming into work.I loved being able to help others and get my tasks done quickly."
good,"Excellent pay and benefits, but management left much to be desired.  Micro-managing is no way to manage your employees."
good,it is a good place to get an entry level job and move up in the company.  its hard at first but once you get to know people it gets better.
good,That was my first job in IT industry. I gain lot of things from there. that's very helped in my career. I loved it. Good environment. Good communications.
good,I enjoyed learning about new things in the insurance world.
good,Always look forward to going to work. Can always move up through the company
good,"I've been researching this company and talking to several employees. All have expressed their opinion of what a good company this is and I've been so impressed, I wish to publish my review. Great Job Sentry"
good,A typical work day revolves around making contact with claimants and insured's to get statements and go over the process and coverages. 
good,"I take incoming calls from internal and external customers about auto policies. I forward information to customers through email, fax and mail. Also take payments from customers and make changes to their auto policy. I learned more about different state laws and requirements in auto insurance. Management always asked for input from employees in work productivity. My coworkers were very helpful and knowledgeable. The hardest part of the job is when technical issues with our systems happen and can some times take weeks to be resolved. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help people travel on the road worry free."
good,"Decent place to work, pay is well within average, people are nice, however, some departments don't offer advancement within the department. Be nice to advance within your department instead of leaving it to learn a completely different job."
good,"Management could be better.  Good working environment. Good pay. Benefits good but could be better. Not a lot of room for advancement. Overall, a good place to work."
good,Spent most of my days testing and analyzing documents and programs.  Writing up documents for the business and programmers to review.  The workplace culture is a mix of laid back and serious from the switching of the CEO's and you can tell between management.
good,"This is an okay place to work. Benefits are good; culture is often stressful. Some managers are excellent, and others are not as good. Hours can sometimes interfere with life-work balance."
good,expected to go from one end of my territory to the other in a day.  Its very big challenge with my freeway travel.  My current management lacks communication skill sometimes.  I work independently from my car and home.  I schedule and control my daily workload.
good,My day at work consisted of answering inbound calls for the majority of the day. Must be able to understand computer programs and offer great customer service. The employees are friendly and you are offered many perks. Management is not the greatest and everyone is just a number.
good,"The management and co-workers have an upbeat and fun personailities in this fast paced, stressful environment.  Organizational skills are the key to work here along with strong customer service skills. Biggest lesson learned in this position was the confidence I took away in my ability to succeed with the learning curve I starting in the position.  Hardest part of the job was a work-life balance."
good,"If you're looking to settle down Sentry is a great place for you.  The company offers some great perks, like a pool, rec center, golf course, theater. Sentry is a big part of the community."
good,Senior management could use a bit more training on employee diversity.  Not everyone is straight and married. Salaries seem a bit low compared to the industry in general.
good,"Working at Sentry, you will receive fair pay for the area. Working in the claims department can be very stressful at times. The management re-structures often and can result in frequent changes. Overall good job."
good,Very busy throughout the day which was great and before you know it the day is over. You also have the ability to move forward in the company.
good,"The organization values its associates but fails to provide any type of advancement opportunities. Many cases of micromanagement from the top-down structure, and the compensation is less than average. Great benefits but overall suffers from an office space like workplace."
good,"Good place to work, great training and bonus program. Taking calls in an inbound call center with questions on car insurance."
good,Excellent place to work.  I have learned many skills to use in the future.  My co-workers a fun and helpful.  I enjoy being able to help customer and make a difference. 
good,"This was a really good company to work for. The people are great.  For an insurance company, the company is on the cutting edge of technology."
good,"work load was good "
good,"I learned quite a lot and overall a productive experience."
good,I enjoyed my time at Sentry Insurance.  The benefits were excellent and the culture was good.  I worked independently from my home as an direct writing agent.  Unfortunately they discontinued the division the I worked for.
good,Provided information to clients to choose most effective automobile for their family and meet the needs of all that will operate the vehicle. Provided excellent customer service.
good,Good people and work environment for the most part a good team environment. New equipment and Airplanes. Able to work on your own in a fast paced at times environment.
good,I have been constantly put in projects that management deems important. The previous regime left our books in bad shape and a large amount of my time is spent reviewing and reclassifying errors created by them. I am also in charge of month end closing of four general ledger accounts. My Senior staff accountant work very well together and over the last few months I have slowly taken several of his daily responsibilities. Overall the workplace is enjoyable and a good place to work.
good,Good place to work.  Good engagement among all employees.  Culture is good as well.
good,"Great company to work for. Laid back family culture. Pay was a little low for the mortgage industry but it was a great place to start, they pay for all training and licenses."
good,would recommend Sentry Insurance Co. as a very good career opportunity.  Compensation programs were not as competitive as needed to compete with other A+ rated Property Insurance Companies
good,"Sentry Insurance is a professional environment they appreciate their employees, good benefits, calm work environment.  Fair when numbers need to be met.  Good people."
good,"Overall a great company that cares about its employees and customers. Everyone is treated respectfully, given good benefits and the pay is fair. You are expected to work hard, but you aren't micromanaged or babysat by management"
good,"Depending on the department you work in, Sentry Insurance is one of the best places to work around. I personally work in the Security department, which to me seems a little underappreciated for what we do, if I decide I can stick through it until I can transfer departments I would love to work here through retirement if I could! Until I can transfer though I need to look for better pay around the city."
good,"Overall, Sentry was a great place to work. I did not enjoy working in cubicles with little collaboration. It was a slower paced work environment and i was looking for something more fast paced."
good,"I retired in 2009, so I don't know the current atmosphere within the company, but when I was there, it was a cordial atmosphere with a good team environment."
good,"Training at best . .lacks definition for job required to perform, although you are told, training is the basics . .its not real life training we can give you, it lacks everyone to be on same page,  with a company that has been around for so long . .and not to have a training manual to follow, and training for a week.  sure lacks training when Insurance requirements are so many to follow."
good,"Sentry may be the best company out there for insurance agents. We sell business insurance, group benefits, retirement plans, and life insurance for very select industries. A typical day consists of soliciting new business, servicing current business, and planning based on company strategies/goals to better achieve new and retention business. They are very good to their sales reps compared to other companies, really ""investing"" in their reps rather than ""sell fast or die"" like I see elsewhere. However, the insurance sales world is very competitive, especially in a state like PA, and Sentry's products tend to be the best in actual product quality, but are very rarely competitive in pricing. As a result, it can be very difficult to acquire and retain new business unless you are extremely motivated, hardworking, and possess all the qualities of an excellent sales rep. I succeeded here for 4 years and am eager to see what the future brings."
good,"Sentry is a great place to start out in your career.  They offer stability as well as allowing new associates to become acclimated to the Agile Project Methodology."
good,"Daily task management, calling claimants to settle claims, taking new assignments, Managing current assignments, answering calls when claimants have questions, managing emails, and helping others when needed."
good,"busy and time goes very fast.  A very talent group of co-workers. "
good,"Benefits were excellent, but management left room for improvement"
good,"In general, I'd say Sentry is a good company. They are both good to work for and good to the community they're based in. They consistently make large donations to area fundraisers and have decent benefits for their employees. That having been said, my job in particular isn't terribly enjoyable, but it's mainly because I have found in the past eight months that a desk job isn't really for me; I need to be more active."
good,"Overall a good place to work, no bad things to say about anybody. Not a very progressive company in terms of sustainability and employee benifits, but a pretty nice place to work overall."
good,"Great corporate culture (lots of free lunches, relaxed environment, flexible hours), only complaint is things are very slow moving in terms of advancement"
good,Producer of 3rd market insurer's with excellent claim service in the greater Atlanta area. Well run office with very capable personnel Management responds to their clients.
good,Very nice people to work for. Enjoyed the job and people. Management was fun gave out prizes for your work. Training all the time so you are unto date on all your work.
good,Sentry Insurance was a great place to work! If they were still writing business in Massachusetts and had  a claim office in Ma for Auto and  injuries I would apply again!
good,"Work is easy, mind numbing basic cleaning things. Nothing to hard about the job. Everything is easy, very independent based. Workplace culture is fine. Haven't learned much."
good,"Sentry is a great company to work for. In the area of Claims, we all know and expect a busy workday non-stop, but with the helpful spirits of the employees around you and the outstanding inter-office relations, it's easy to find a balance when the going gets tough. If you're someone who is self-motivated and competitive, you'll do well."
good,"Sentry is a really good company to work for, although everyday was stressful and everyday was  the was different , I would setup my computer and walk over to my supervisors desk to get any update and changes. Because the system was so big and there was so much to learn, I would learn something new everyday.  the company only trains you for three and half days, and they expect you to learn everything in those days. other than that supervisors had preference on employees on physical appearance. the only enjoyable about the company was the paid and learning something new everyday."
good,"This company provides their employees with many benefits not found at other companies today.  The physical structure includes an in house cafeteria, gym, pool, on site Credit Union.  It also is extremely dedicated to providing employees with further education opportunities."
good,Very conservative; take care of the employees who take care of them. Most employees at the home office in WI have been there for 20+ years so set in their ways.
good,"The TITAN program at a high level consists of the addition of Standard Business Products, Dealer Operation, Transportation WC, and Servicing Carrier Business. The objective of this project is to build a new Policy database to replace the legacy system which is used by downstream applications."
good,A typical work day was very busy and productive. I learned how to be a leader and achieved my highest goals. Management was loyal and very helpful. The co-workers were all team players. The hardest part of the job was leaving. Staying employed and how they valued their employees.
good,"Excellent initial training program, that provided a new employee, that was new to the industry, a plethora of knowledge. "
good,"Business to business insurance sales.  Sold commercial lines and developed a strong book of business through cold calling and follow through.  With over 100 customers, time management was a priority as I had to balance renewals and service with developing new business.  Managed my sales pipeline to achieve and exceed quotas."
good,I was able to work with a great team and provide exceptional call center customer service.
good,"It's been a long time since I worked at Sentry. It was a good company to work for - challenging, able to advance, great co-workers."
good,When I first worked there it was great But the management change the last year I was there it was misable But it depend on your manager Good pay. discount on insurance this company was a dog eat dog company
good,"Overall sentry is a good place to work. They pay well, and the management does tend to recognize people who deserve it. On the other hand, the manager to employee ratio is SUPER manager heavy, and they can (not always) do alot of micro management. This can be a problem if you get a bad manager, but there are really good ones in there too. I had both in my time here, after my first manager got fired. The bad one made me not want to work here (or at all), and the good one was quite good. The managers will give you a raise if you deserve one, but ""deserving one"" requires a whole lot more work than the typical person in order for them to pay attention. I don't think this is unique to this company, however."
good,"easy work, good culture although management could be better in some areas. working Saturdays is useless but a requirement in this position, I will be happy to move onto a different role but glad I got my foot in the door with this company"
good,"daily work flow consistent of extensive computer and phone work.  knowledge of federal and state laws and regulations required along with knowledge of mediation, arbitration and suits."
good,Very stressful occupation is the hardest part of the job but the people  with whom you work are excellent. The company also encourages cooperation and team work.
good,"The people there were wonderful to work with and if you put in the work, you can advance in your career. The negatives were that we were understaffed and because of that we were required to work overtime every week, but we were compensated fairly. Overall, I would recommend Sentry to anyone looking for a career in insurance."
good,"I investigated and settled automobile accident claims and injuries. Conducted investigations over the telephone, via mail, fax and email.  I worked on a team of 6- 8 coworkers. Investigating claims required excellent time management and attention to details. Since I was responsible for issuing payment of up to $5000 I worked really closely with management."
good,"Despite working part time at Sentry, I have found that I am thoroughly emotionally burned out from having worked in one of their call centers. The customers can be quite brutal, and there is close to nothing that can be done in response to being insulted or yelled at by caller after caller."
good,In this role you field inbound calls from personal and commercial account holders who are looking to file a claim. It gets boring and repetitive but the pay was solid because I was in school full time and did this part time.
good,"Great place to work,  some departments are flexible with times. On site dining and gym membership, growing company,  and overall care for their employees."
good,Sentry is a very large company that has many different positions that needs to be filled. There are dozens of positions in the IT and Programing departments. The management is generally good depending on the area but there is always room for progress and promotion.
good,"I worked on the road for Sentry which gave me freedom to work from home. It requires a great deal of concentration and discipline to work effectively from home. "
good,"I would recommend this job to anyone who is comfortable cold calling prospective accounts, and doesn't mind getting told to get lost numerous times a day. In order to succeed in this position you must be persistent. That means calling on the same leads 5-10 times before the decision maker will even talk to you in most cases."
good,"A lot of fun. Learn new stuff at your pace and develop for real world use applications.I learned many new things, mainly new programming languages and methods."
good,"Reviewed claims and spoke with claimants and our insureds. This was a very fast paced atmosphere, which I excelled at. Management in most locations was great, however, the location that I worked at had untrained managers and made the job a bit challenging. The benefits and the training provided were phenomenal."
good,You are completely isolated. There is no down time and no time to decompress it's back to back calls of customers that are furious with the company . Supervisor you hardly ever see or come into contact with
good,"If Sentry had stayed in Atlanta, I would probably still be working for them (of course, my salary would have needed to be increased).  They were the company that let me in the door for my career and I advanced from a document typist to a commercial lines rater within a year.  It was very unfortunate that they decided to close the Atlanta headquarters."
good,"Sentry was my best kept secret, I felt like it was a ram in the bush because I had a job that was not meeting the needs of my life style. Just as I was about to give up along came my new opportunity tucked away in Goldsboro, NC"
good,"Very well structured , good company to work for definitely. Always had good ways to provide customer care and makes everyone happy to be a part of the company."
good,A typical day at work consisted of training and developing my employees. We had to work hard to ensure we met our department goals.
good,It was a pleasure to work for this company. I learned a lot from my managers and other peers. It also helped me better my customer service skills as well as computer skills.
good,Working for this company really showed me how to run a business with character and integrity. I would recommend this company to anyone in treated in learning about business.
good,My experience with Sentry Insurance included working as Claims Examiner and eventually promoted to Claims Director/ Vice president. Some of my other duties included establishing successful subrogation and SIU units.
good,This is a great place to work with a small town feel.
good,This is a great company to get into. Lots of room for advancement if you want to go higher. Always willing to help with questions and hands on training
good,"Great Company that takes care of its associates and it's surrounding communities .  Lots of amenities offered for Sentry employees including a workout facility on campus, indoor pool on campus, tennis courts, championship and globally recognized golf course, etc."
good,"Management does not micro manage, they have expectations that are reasonable. The hardest part of the job is when we are in a large renewal month, the only hard part is that there is a lot of work to be done. The most enjoyable part of the job is all of the fun activities and fundraisers that we participate in throughout the year."
good,"Leads where horrible, and management did not scrub the leads and you are told when you where hired, some leads called 70 time or more."
good,"I really enjoyed my time here taking calls, and servicing policies. Co-workers were friendly and close-nit. We are still friends 4 years later! Management did a good job in some things but showed some favortism, and couldn't seem to give the same answer from all management"
good,Very exciting place to work and learn new ways of paying different kinds of invoices and the way claims are taken care of.
good,"If you are completing your work on time then everything will be wonderful here. The people are great, and are always willing to help out or go get a drink after work. It can be a very laid back environment, as the management tends to let you flex hours however you want so long as everything is moving along nicely."
good,"The company is very strong and financially stable, but the growth potential is slow. There are not many openings to move vertically and growth is mostly slow-walked by management. Work life balance is highly valued by management and the people are all great."
good,There are plenty of job opportunities when it comes to advancement within the company.  Be it in the same department or in another.  Pay is well compensated.
good,it was very fun and competitive atmosphere.  worked daily claims and anything over that was just padding for under your belt. basically bragging rites
good,It's a very fast paced environment. Can be stressful at times but the culture is outstanding. Co-workers are fabulous. Really like my managers. Opportunities to advance is there.
good,"I work for Sentry Recovery i did a lot of posting payments,Assisted customer and collected on collection accounts i worked everyday only called in 1 time since i was hired there."
good,"Sentry has a lot of great benefits, but the turn over of the BA staff is high.  Management is getting better, but there is still room for improvement.  There is collaboration between business units, so that is a great benefit to implementation of projects."
good,"Work on this company is around fixated schedules arranged every two weeks. Your times are clearly define with enough time for changes to be arranged. The amount of income calls can vary on a daily basis, the company however has other documents that will need to be worked along claims. So you will stay busy no matter what. "
good,Sentry is a great place to work and it has a great work/life balance.  The management is great and they are very approachable.  The only drawbacks is that the company is not based in Chicago and that overall salary is not very high.
good,"Working at Sentry Insurance may seems like a scary idea, but I loved my job! I enjoyed figuring out the behind-the-scenes works of 401k and all of my coworkers were very helpful. A lot of folks came and left because they did not understand the work, but if you are held onto, it is a great workplace with many benefits."
good,"I love this company. I've never worked anywhere where the employer actually cares about both it's employees and their customers. They also are very involved with the United Way and countless other charities. I get something ridiculous like 32 paid days off a year and a profit sharing bonus. I am only leaving because the area I live in is terrible and I need a change of scenery. I have nothing but good things to say about Sentry, except that they havrn't relocated me yet!"
good,"Process 10 initial claims per day. Obtain recorded statements from all parties involved. Setup vehicle inspections. Review police reports. Review vehicle inspections. Determine liability. Pay parties. Close. Subrogate against other insurance companies. Respond to Arbitration. I learned how to handle claims from a different point of view, Management was always helpful. My co-workers were always willing to help . The hardest part of the job was making a liability decision. The most enjoyable part was investigating the accident"
good,Great place to work with great benefits.
good,It was a sales job so there really was no typical day. We had appointments that we set up and cold calls that we made for the purpose of setting up appointments. Our manager often went out on calls with us for teaching purposes as well as helping us presenting the product and hopefully selling it
good,Very fast paced work place.  Stress is placed on customer service and they give you the tools to provide that service.  Training is essential and given top priority.
good,"Sentry Insurance was a great place to work."
good,Sentry treats their employees well with good pay and great benefits. There are many opportunities to advance within the company. Some management can be hard to work for but you can have that at any job.
good,"I like working for sentry , excellent 401k , pto , flexible.  I am looking for a part time job to work around my full time job. They do alot of team building exercises,  they want feed back on how to make your department better."
good,"Great company.  High expectations, but hard work is rewarded accordingly.  Suitable for those who enjoy routine and structure.  Must be able to adapt as industry regulations change often."
good,Sentry Insurance invests a great deal in their employees. Employees are provided with multiple opportunities for continuing education to assist with better production in current position and career advancement. Sentry is a strong company and a great place to work.
good,I worked at the company until they went out of business.  I was at the company for 11 years prior to their closing and would not have left if they did not close the company.
good,"I loved working at Sentry Insurance.  My managers were amazing and the assignments were great.  I learned so much while working there and wouldn't have left except they relocated my entire location.  I chose to stay where I was."
good,"Great company, strong values, great training and good compensation."
good,"Coming in I had very little experience in the field, but I've learned more in the short time that I've been here than I did all of college. The managers are fun and easy to work for and they help you as much as possible. Overall the environment and people are fantastic."
good,"Over all it is a good place to work. I would prefer day hours and a consistant schedule,  but that option is notavailable for me. High call volume calls and very busy"
good,The team and supervisor are very in hands to make sure I felt welcome and comfortable. They also made time to review my calls and answer any questions I had regarding my work.
good,"Excellent company to work for. Great support system, attainable goals, excellent work environment. I would highly recommend working at Sentry, I really enjoyed my time working at Sysco."
good,never worked here not sure why I have to take this survey. I have no experience working in insurance. This must have been made in error when I signed up
good,Loved the job. Only reason I left this position was because I had an opportunity to work at Liberty Mutual. They were starting a new unit called the National Service Center. It intrigued my interest.
good,This Niche is different than any other commercial insurance. I deal with semi drivers across the Eastern states. I deal with all nationalities. I help them get insurance and service their every insurance need to get them going on the road.
good,"My time spent on the Network Infrastructure Team at Sentry Insurance as an Intern was an experience that I do not believe exists outside of the fortune-500 world. An incredibly competitive experience, Sentry only accepts the best when considering possible employment. When not spent actively engaged and working alongside the Infrastructure team at Sentry, my time outside of work was spent studying for equivalent certifications while staying in my company-provided housing, free of charge. I have never worked harder in my life than I did to receive an offer to be on the Infrastructure team, and due to a change in circumstances, I was unable to accept their very generous salaried offer. One would be foolish to not consider working for this company as it is, without a doubt, one of the best companies in the world to work for. I have never met more driven and friendly employees while working with a company and have made friends that I know I will have for life because of Sentry Insurance. If you are one of the lucky few to be considered for a position at Sentry, do not hesitate to accept."
good,I enjoyed my time with Sentry. This was a company that if you wanted a stable job where you were able to expand your already included salary with commissions then you could. The harder you worked the more you saw results. This is a very transparent company that is willing to help you in any way. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to work for a great company with amazing benefits and a competitive product.
good,"Sentry is one of my greatest employers.  The company culture is awesome - company values its employees.  Employees get evaluate based on performance and contribution.  Overall, great experience."
good,"Laid back company."
good,Deliver and pick up mail from the sale representatives. In the main  mailroom I would sort and stamp outgoing mail. I would sort the sale  representatives mail into the correct bin and send out.
good,"Great place to work , it was absolutely amazing and I learned a lot from my time there. I would reccomend the company to anyone in search of a stable organization"
good,Great benefits and good place to work as you were always learning new things and there was lots of room for advancement.  Work day went very fast.  Good balance of home and work.
good,A typical day at work is fulfilling our customers needs and being the best we can be while growing as a team and family. This is what a typical day is to me.
good,Answering inbound calls. Taking down information due to car accidents. Transferring callers to the right department or claim reps. I learned to handle callers who were upset and made  in a manner that makes them feel better and more comfortable. The managers and coworkers were great! The hardest part of this job was taking the calls where the accidents lead to the death of the callers family member. The best part of my job was getting to talk to new people from all over the world every day!
good,Worked as integration developer for the team which integrates FormsGateway component with PolicyCenter and billing center to produce Forms using Documaker.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is woking with colleagues from different cultures.Spend time getting to know co-workers and colleagues from on a personal level, recognizing that the degree of private vs. public space will be different based on the culture.
