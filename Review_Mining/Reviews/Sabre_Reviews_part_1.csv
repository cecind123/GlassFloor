rating,review
bad,If you don’t want a career and you want your job to go India then work for Sabre. They will lie to you all the while preparing your hard work for 1/3 the price in India. Layoffs are every quarter and job security is zero.
bad,"Sabre might be a great company, I am not sure, but I have to admit that a great company has a great training. My first day of training was awful. Very unprofessional trainers, they were very amateur, unsecure and a lot of misinformation. Too many misinformed young trainers. Training schedule is a mess. No set breaks, no lunch time. Their pay rate for a person who speaks 3 languages is extremely low."
bad,Management Turnover Has Created a Toxic environment. They don’t listen to employee engagement. Morale is at an all time low. Business is slow to evolve to the market
bad,"Story was later broken up into 28 Sub-stories!!!"
bad,This is a terrible place to work.  They have a history of massive hirings and massive lay offs.  They don't care about their people.
bad,"There was a history of belittling the employees that were not favored and and punishing those that were not ""good enough"". Management barely knew what we employees were up to and regularly ignored instructions and emails. No consideration for professional growth or development was given by management and most requests for information or guidance were ignored if you were not one of the favorites. The most difficult part of this job was trying to find a reason to care about the work since it was obvious no one from management did. The most enjoyable part of the job were the coworkers. They were all talented people who put up with too much."
bad,"The entire company is garbage and they are a bunch of sneaky, unprofessional, unethical, and slimy people. They don't deserve any stars. I really hope what to happen to me does not happen to anyone else! I'm so glad I've moved on to BIGGER and BETTER things!"
bad,the Company policy is bit not Faith full work Pressure is too High very difficult to Handle. as they have so much work after a good performance bonus they will fired you because of Project over in middle
bad,Not for professional employees.good for those just out of college. Too much gossips n politics. Poor HR team. Well known for hire n fire culture. Not suggested for reference.
bad,"At least twice each year, employees of Sabre Holdings are catapulted into panic mode by the threat of massive layoffs. Most duck, hide, and make sure they are firmly attached to a billable project. The unfortunate ones get 30 days notice and the hatchet."
bad,This company thrives on having meetings and not coming to conclusions.  They would rather work by escalation than planning ahead and plan the work accrodingliny.
bad,"This place is very strange. On the outside it looks like this great company but once you are inside it's cut throat, there is no familiarization training, it's learn as you go.  One airline runs the AS side of things which leads to losing customers.  Performance reviews are based on heresay, the manager who you report to has little say, they go in front of a committee. If you are not in the cliques they won't know you and if they don't know you, your score will be low and you get no raise or profit sharing. "
bad,"Nearly all projects are date driven, with quality and functionality secondary. Product using outdated technology. Very few people want to do their best and for most it is just a job. Trying to have 80% of development offshore. Very few good leaders. Indecision and CYA mentality. Promotions uneven. Culture is fear-based."
bad,Changing company going through difficult times as it chases its quarterly earnings.  There are talented individuals who make the experience enjoyable but found that it was exceptionally political under new leadership.
bad,"Productive work place. There was just no advancement available. You had to KNOW somebody there to gain advancement. They were NOT fair about the pay increases. I was a work from home agent was the ONLY plus,"
bad,"Always on the job. Meetings around the world at all hours of the day and night. No strategic direction from the C suite.  Constant layoffs, poor employee engagement and morale."
bad,"Some of the people I worked with, made it tolerable, but I was really expecting more from Sabre. Nepotism seemed pretty common. Leadership is very indecisive and will change their mind on things from one day to the next. Working in that kind of environment was pretty unsettling for my team."
bad,"The atmosphere is very relaxed, however, the departments lack structure. There’s no real training when starting a new position. Then, you’re asked to perform with no reliable tools, which later creates chaos from one department blaming another for all their short comings. With that being said, the Corn Hole Game in the lobby makes for a great stress reliever!"
bad,Easy to get along with a people person love to work straight forward if I don't like it I will let you know that day smile all the time I'm just a happy person
bad,"Sabre has lost its direction and competitive edge. Rested on the industry lead and never grasped the impact of  the ""global"" nature of this industry requirement to  ""be better , fast , and value"" . now that the wheels are falling-off, they are blaming the employees. So far behind the competition, and a ""North America-centrist"" mentality they are out-dated-very much like a Block buster story."
bad,I would not recommend.  The company does not care about the employees based on the workload an employee has and the benefits they provide.  Health benefits are very expensive.
bad,"Sabre is in need of some major changes and the new executive team are promising that they are coming. The changes will come in time but they are too slow. The lower level management makes working at Sabre very difficult. The expectations of the employees is to work 24/7 and on weekends according to the customers needs, without any breaks. It is very difficult to always be on the road or supporting global customers and have any sort of work life balance."
bad,"Company has lost a lot of experienced talent at the top recently - obviously gained new management but they don't have a clue either.  "
bad,"If you are as full time employee under the shadow of a manager and if you dont care of morality and meritocracy, then you may have a feeling my job is saved, but your carrer & growth will be in question. Most employees are not confident to move or join outside because of the laid-back managers & slow posion enviroment ( against self growth ). If you are full of aspirations looking for nurturing environment and nono-frustrated teams then never think of joining except just for few months as a stop-gap. "
bad,"Culture divides rather than create cohesive teams working together. Customers are only held in high esteem when Sabre is trying to get their business.  Otherwise, they are a burden to be dealt with, whatever was/is promised during the sales pitch is well, not necessarily a guarantee by Sabre to fulfill.  After all as one director stated ""airline's don't really know what they want, they will ask for everything."""
bad,"Fighting fires becomes the central focus of your day.  Currently, executive presence is low.  New CEO, New VP AS and the task force is exiting as well."
bad,"My manager spent more time taking vacation and traveling than she did at her desk. She had no clue how to manage us with respect and integrity. When it came time for her to let me go, she fabricated a lot of the information along with HR to ensure that I would never be able to work there again. In other words, she lied about my work ethics and had it in for me starting the first week I worked there."
bad,"They throw you to the wolves and no support.  Even though I had a new hire buddy, they did very little to help me learn systems in place. Everyone is out for themselves. People leaving in droves."
bad,The job would've been fine if management pulled their head out of their behind and stopped catering to the incompetent supervisors. Plenty of skilled folks will be looked over in favor of the brown noser.
bad,Management assigned mandatory overtime to keep up with demanding orders. If one does not comply with these strenuous hours working a labor job they let workers go.
bad,"Favoritism is obvious when laying off/terminating, If you aren't social enough you'll be on the chopping block. Many Directors don't know the business, they are moved around between areas just because. There is a ""layoff"" every year since Management does not know what they are doing. This company is doomed once AA leaves them. There's no work for Airline after 2017 and it's dwindling. RUN AWAY to a company that appreciates their employees and can provide security."
bad,"Sabre can be a wonderful place to work, however there are a lot of morale and political issues that can also make it a difficult environment.  There is certainly a 'good old boy' network in place that makes advancement difficult if you are not part of the in-crowd."
bad,"Management issues. Repeated Layoffs some with quotas for rating employees below par. Bias towards certain groups of individuals. However, good Compensation and Benefits. Reduce headcount to stay within budget.  Prefer 'yes' people rather than healthy debate. People generally very good. More process and procedure than work."
bad,"Just be wary, layoffs are norm there. Beautiful campus though!"
bad,Everyone on the executive team is new. They say we are undergoing a transformation but everything is a mess. Execs don't value long term experience. The entire leadership team has changed multiple times in the past 3 years.
bad,"Good place to work, the culture is pretty laid back."
bad,"Sabre is a technically fun and challenging place to work, but like most other very large corporations, there are some big drawbacks:"
bad,A good place to get experience. Lots of senior leadership turnover and excessive unnecessary travel expenses.Going through a lot of layoffs and people remaining are picking up more than one full-time equivalent's worth of work. Lots of stress.
bad,"stress was put on root cause analysis.  I did this for batch applications.  got to learn some programming.  enjoyed  interacting with different departments to find a resolution to late batch applications.  but after awhile, things became highly political.  got less cooperation.  departments would start pointing fingers rather than stay fixed on finding solutions."
bad,"Tech is outdated, the company is slowly advancing, however still way behind the competition. Elastic work hours are a plus. The company has old school mindset, production deployments take place every two months. Tons of bureaucracy which slows everything and everyone down."
bad,"Sabre was good when i joined culture wise and management wise in 2010. Now a days, every now and then they are firing people, which is making the place not secure to work"
bad,"The company recently had many layoffs. I would caution anyone who is thinking about joining the company. Management keeps layoffs secretive and then out of the blue you could be laid off. I left a stable company to join Sabre, had not been there long, and was then laid off which has been frustrating. When I joined Sabre they were hiring so many people, so I don’t think their planning/forecasting in line with their business needs."
bad,Management kept saying that their employees are highly valuable but yet they will lay-off a US based employee and hire an offshore person to improve profits.
good,I wanted more than 60 plus hours and night shift. slim supply of parts and tools to properly do a job. No one noticed the hard work but they sure saw your weaknesses
good,"Constructive feedback at the right time. Performance review software. Get a demo. Employee Engagement. People Analytics. Facilitate Conversations. Performance Management. Build a Feedback Culture. Drive Employee Success. Features: Real-Time Feedback, Goal Management."
good,"I was hired on to Sabre Holdings through a contractor. I never made it out of the training period before they let me go. Here's a summary of my day to day experience at Sabre. "
good,I honestly don't have anything psotive to write about the company. I have been there going on 2 years and am currently seeking new employment.
good,"Sabre is trying to pull itself out of the 80's.  They are trying but, they still have personal in key positions that do not want change. Sr. level technical staff are not empowered to make decisions."
good,"In effort to maximize profit, Sabre exploited H-1B programs replacing many skilled US employees with temporary H-1B staffing.  In addition, they moved their call center to Uraguay in efforts to lower cost, and highly leveraged development teams in Poland and Mombai India."
good,"Since being here it’s a great learning experience if you aren’t looking for advanced in the field. The people are nice but management keeps making changes that aren’t helping the agents successful. Every month you tend to worry if you don’t get a call grade of 90 you could be fired but they do little to help you get to 90. This job is pretty easy all you do is book hotels. So if your wanting to learn the field, or part time job this would be it."
good,This is a good company but your stay will depend on the type of leader you have the luck of having. Not sure all departments are being correctly represented in this new shape.
good,Sabre has overall been a good company to work for.  Recently has had too many high level management changes and turnovers.  Has had 2 rounds of layoffs recently.   Letting the good employees go and others are starting to leave due to low job security.
good,"Sabre doesn't understand the Software Design Life Cycle (SDLC) and the Back office lead had no technical experience.  I provided all of the skill to get the job done and it was an uphill struggle.  In the end, the budget got cut all of a sudden and the team was wiped out except for the lead.  It provided good experience and it will help me when I move onto my next position."
good,"I was a member of the senior leadership and I can attest to the fact that employees are only valued by their cost footprint. Once your salary gets above the mean for any reason ( e,g, performance bonus), you become a target for layoff regardless of performance or value to product quality. Too many excellent performers are let go to shrink costs, despite high margins. The firm is a great place to work as long as you understand that to survive, you need to undermine/kill your competition within the firm."
good,"Avoid working on any projects not directly related to your manager.  This company moves resources around and then cycles thru layoffs.  I hope it has changed since I worked there long ago  as they were too slow to change,  and too tied to AA."
good,"Sabre offers very good benefits, but there is no real effort to ensure employees have a good work/life balance.  Another con to work for Sabre is that they have way too many layoffs, so you never know if you're safe."
good,I work very hard to the point where I need to start taking breaks and vacations. I need to learn on my own. I still cannot prevent the jobs moving outside of unites states.
good,"Sabre is extremely busy which is great b/c the days go by quickly. I enjoyed my job duties. There work from home flexibility was great until they took it away. There are a lot of organizational changes for the better but it's unfortunate it resulted in job loss for many. Salary and benefits are great. Depending on the department, you can have great success at Sabre."
good,crazy crazy crazy from beginning to end no e or plan and changing priorities depending on the next whim sweatshop driven by very aggressive disrespectful people with unrealistic expectations very silo-ed and clickish
good,"Top Leadership is like a revolving door, if they aren't getting cut loose during these mass layoffs, they are walking out the door on their own due to their complete lack of confidence in Sabre's directions. At the end, Sabre goes through mass layoffs every 2 years with mini layoffs in between."
good,"It is a decent place to work, the people are great but any commitment to the company is not repayed. Focus has gone away from the people and keeping talent to the bottom line dollar"
good,"If ti was not for GDS, Sabre would have gone extinct by now, like Dinosaurs."
good,In order to get anything done at Sabre you have to be willing to jump throught a lot of hoops.
good,"A typical day includes setting up your position with your headset and keyboard. Allow extra time for this. Even though this is a technololgy company, things don't always work correctly. I learned valuable information about numerous hotels and their features. Management did change frequently, but so did the agents.  This was a scripted position and you are evaluated frequently. Your score will vary depending on who evaluates you. The most difficult part of the job was to always give accurate information. You answer calls for many different hotels, and frequently the information isn't updated. Customers are under the impression they are calling each hotel directly.  I did enjoy the opportunity to talk to many different customers from different places. Management did have different activity days to break up the monotony."
good,"Si bien las tareas a desempeñar en Sabre y los conocimientos que se adquieren en su práctica son interesantes, el ambiente de presiones y la manera en que esta se ejerce desde los mandos medios atenta contra la sana experiencia de los empleados. El mensaje de que ser parte de Sabre deberia ser motivacion suficiente para dar tu maximo desmotiva y hace sentir al empleado como prescindible. Los ultimos episodios de despidos masivos generan un incremento en la sensacion de inseguridad laboral"
good,"Sabre was a good company to work for, it has since folded and no longer operates in the Private Sector."
good,Wait a couple of years to see how things play out. Company has new strategy and is still working out the kinks and getting the right players in place.
good,"This is a great company to work for if you don't mind a waterfall, command and control culture and if your core values align with the company culture."
good,"A typical day at work was easy but frustrating because every body seems to think their problem is a priority over everyone else."
good,Great opportunities to build your career straight from college with a global company.  Advancement mid and late career is difficult as longevity is viewed as a deficit.
good,"It's okay , the co-worker are great but the moral and management is not good. The hotels are one of a kind. Great learning opportunity"
good,"Typical day consisted of running, writing, and designing tests for new releases."
good,"Environment friendly, super relaxed nice location. Good HR but not so good retention, lot of project gets cancelled or not funded."
good,The hardest part is that work follows you home on the weekdays and weekends. Interesting work though.
good,Sabre at one time allowed innovation by allowing questioning of the status quo.  Recent upper management stifled the ability to question and with it innovation.  Current CEO seems to be opening that door back up but jury is still out....
good,"I've been with Sabre for a long time, and I've found that your employee experience really depends on your manager. Every business unit feels like a completely different company and your manager can make or break your experience. The work life balance is good as most managers will allow you to work from home if needed. The facility is nice with a gym and cafeteria as well as fun activities from time to time. The dress code is casual."
good,"One of the reasons that I left my job at Sabre is because the culture had changed drastically. It used to be a place where employees felt valued and made a difference both at work and in the community. Over the last couple of years, the environment changed to a point where you didn’t feel valued, you were asked to do more with less and volunteerism and community involvement had gone away. It used to be a fun place to work, where you felt energized and empowered. There was no energy where you worked. "
good,"As a long time Sabre employee, there are good and bad things about the company."
good,Sabre is struggling a bit financially but the people are good and fun culture.  New C-level leaders have throttled growth and layoff has affected attitudes
good,"I took the job in the reservations center eith the intention of transfering to another department. However that did not happen. Great benefits, it's a lid back atmosphere"
good,"Nothing to say just needs more improvement on the floor, the labor is hard working literally my have broken back even if we do the proper techniques. Needs better management, they need to know that the employees are doing their best on productions. Honest it really makes the employees hurting for actually working 12 hours straight."
good,"Unique industry, global company with many opportunities. Good work life balance with flexible work schedule and opportunities to work from home. Competitive pay with ok benefits."
good,"Sabre Corporation is a travel technology company and is the largest Global Distribution Systems provider for air bookings in North America.  The technology and data-driven solutions help airline, hotel and travel agency customers grow their businesses and transform the traveler experience."
good,"The Management didn't have proper planning and they put all pressure on employees. They seemed to follow agile , but there no proper process in place. Even the Billing and the deadlines were not planned"
good,"You learn a lot about all aspects of working in a big corporations, and in technology. However, the company culture would benefit from more communications from the top-down."
good,"Sabre's higher management was changed dramatically in preparation to go public."
good,"Overall, working for the Sabre call center provided sufficient work experience. There were many issues with the software, which made tasks difficult at times."
good,"Very supportive colleagues/culture with a broad, international perspective in the broadest of industries - travel. Senior leadership has been there a long time, which may limit their ability to innovate. Travelocity lends a ""dot-com"" dynamic but most of the overall revenue comes from quite old B2B business models that often seem at odds with what travel supplier expect/want."
good,Management issues and reorganization on a continuous basis.
good,para uma empresa obter um crescimento é nescessario acima de tudo obter respeito entre lideres e funcionarios pois todos os dois dependem do emprego independente do valor salarial
good,.mass lay off with no notice. Pay was low. Ever changing schedule. Worked all holidays. I do not recommend sabre as a place to work. Especially the call center.
good,"Once a great company, frequent management changes and a large number of departures of key people have rendered the company unable to compete with Amadeus."
good,Managing global customers with co-located teams results in varied working hours as you must work within the customer's time zones.  Must be flexible enough to keep up with changes.
good,"I didnt find strong networking among the staff and among the different projects, but the organization is performing well, making profits and developing itself as well."
good,"Within this organization individuals had to be self-driven.  "
good,"Sabre, EDS and HP are good examples for companies where leadership seem to have their heads stuck in the wrong places and did not properly plan for the future."
good,"Sabre can be a fun and rewarding place to work, however the current environment is one of constant cutting and belt tightening. Even if your product makes a very good profit, it is too easy to end up on the list of things they decide is not important to invest in."
good,Sabre executive management focused on short term profitability and stock price rather that updating infrastructure and capability.  Thus they are in economic duress and will require substantial capital investment to update their infrastructure and modernize their software capabilities.
good,"Was over worked and underpaid. Delivered product for 3 drivera. Instead of just my route."
good,"Sabre is a great place to work for a work life balance, but they are struggling to maintain their current customer base and to attract new customers.  If you are in a good division in the company you'll be safe, but if you are in an area that is struggling, be prepared to be laid off at any time."
good,Sabre is still looking for it's identity after the collapse of the GDS business. Layoffs are a constant concern. Great location for the headquarters up in Southlake.
good,"Sabre gave me a lot of learning experience and career growth.  Provides challenges and encourages personal and career development."
good,"Great job and co-workers work well together.  They provide good pay and benefits.  However, there are to many layoff's and outsourcing of jobs.  Have nothing else."
good,"It's a lot of hard work, but they have a lot of good people. Depending on what type of work a person is into, this can be enjoyable. This was not just for me."
good,Constant hiring and reduction in work force can be very distracting and stressful. Some areas continue to operate on old legacy software stack though some others are making an effort to modernize
good,Sabre is a very competitive and fun environment to work in. Employees here have a good sense of accountability and the global workforce makes it very fun and lively environment
good,Took inbound calls and assist in making hotel reservations. Assist with errors in reservations. Not much else to say. Just easy job.
good,"No job security is the only problem. Work culture is good and managers were also great. Self organized small teams, space is cluttered"
good,"There are too many changes in the management in the last 2 years.  All the new managers want to change something, and sometimes it caused communication problems."
good,"Surprisingly large technology company serving airlines and other travel suppliers. Slow-moving compared to more contemporary tech providers, but many opportunities to move to different roles."
good,Responsible for supervising all credit card billing and claims. Factoring of third parties services. Registering of bank accounts.
good,"Fun Place to work, great benefits, and good commute and location"
good,Fue una muy buena oportunidad de aprendizaje y crecimiento profesional y personal.
good,Sabre is a company focused on growth and delivering the best possible software solutions to their customers.
good,good place until new mgmt took over. Not sure now. good place to learn new things. good people to work with.
good,Sabre as tools and people in place to be very successful. They really treat their employees with respect and dignity no matter what the situation is
good,I had the opportunity to work in a number of areas and learn a number of things.
good,"W Sabre miałam możliwość odbycia wielu szkoleń produktowych i technicznych oraz szansę na rozpoczęcie kariery zawodowej po studiach językowych. Poznałam tam wielu wspaniałych ludzi z którymi dobrze mi się pracowało. Najtrudniejsza w mojej pracy była konieczność przystosowania się do bardzo sztywnych procedur często wyznaczanych przez ludzi słabo znających realia naszej pracy i pracujących za granicą. Najprzyjemniejszym elementem była współpraca i wsparcie niemieckich klientów firmy Sabre. Codzienne obowiązki umożliwiały mi pracę w języku niemieckim, którego biegła znajomość jest moim największym atutem. Wzbogacenie umiejętności językowych o wiedzę praktyczną - dzięki codziennym kontaktom z niemieckimi klientami- jest najcenniejszym doświadczeniem zdobytym przeze mnie w firmie Sabre"
good,A brainy company with smart people
good,"Very fast passed and provided a lot of on the job exposure and training, but not much in the way of formal training."
good,"Very knowledgeable coworkers "
good,"Company provided reasonable options to work in a variety of skilled areas that were directly related to skill, talent, desire, ability key   interest,"
good,"Many organizational changes without a clear direction. New leaders are learning on-the-go, making weird decisions that are impacting employees and stock price. "
good,El trabajo requería de mucha dinámica y atención. Llamadas nacionales e internacionales.
good,Sabre has some interesting products in play in the market that can be fun to work with but It also has a lot of Legacy technical debt which at times can weigh things down
good,"Wonderful customers, peers and depth of expertise in travel.  A new grad can gain a wealth of global experience in the first few years on the job.  Now, the downside - The work days are long and the emails never stop.  Unfortunately, the leadership culture involves too many tactics and not enough focus on true strategy and growth."
good,No work life balance and unorganized work.Good overall management and office.Office hours are too long which might effect the quality of life.Working s easy but timings and flexibility are difficult
good,"The company misrepresented the position. After starting with the company, the role and management changed.  So now, I am in a role that is way to junior."
good,Great place to work. Most enjoyable part of my day was the ability to work from home in the morning and drive to the office in afternoon.  Pay for performance.
good,Fast paced work environment but takes a long time to implement any project.  Good workplace culture across all time zones.  I learned a lot about the travel industry.
good,Sabre is a very demanding company to work for.  Overtime is expected without compensation.  The rules and systems are constantly become more complicated.  Lots of learning potential.
good,The company's leadership team is just okay.  Company need to do SWOT analysis.  That will actually take them to the next level.
good,"While there are many different lines of business within Sabre, the company as a whole is pretty easy going. Some areas are a challenge and some aren't. There is lots of opportunity if you'd like to advance or just remain below the radar."
good,Sabre Inc. has a good working culture focus on new technologies and bringing new products to be the market. It's a leading technology industry in the airline space
good,"- Flex work life balance"
good,"it was kind of a nice place to work in, the pay was good, it was easy and the guys over there were pretty nice to me. iv learn how to read a blueprint and a measuring tape. hardest part of the job was redoing a pipe just the slightest mistake and we had to do the whole thing all over again which I didn't really like."
good,"I worked for Travelocity.  This review is no longer relevant as Travelocity is out of business.  Sabre continues to operate.  The facility there in Southlake is an extremely nice building with the best cafeteria I've ever seen for a work location and I've consulted at many places!  They have a gym too, it's a little small, not the newest equipment, but it does the trick.  Has small locker room."
good,"I worked at Sabre for almost 28 years, got a 'Happy Anniversary' card from the Director / VP on a yearly basis, until I got laid off in 2018. Words had it that it was time to reduce number of older people who made too much money. It was time to outsource my job to Bangalore where it was cheaper and easier to replace whenever they like. A new CEO always came with new strategy, but laying off people was always the first action. Managers and Directors couldn't say 'No' when VP spoke up. Their hands were tied, wouldn't listen our opinions (or they chose not to.) However, the people on the operations were great. They helped each other, even across organizations, no matter how long and how tedious it would take. It happened to me several times and we made it to keep the customer happy. All in all, great place to work and make friends, if you can keep yourself above the radar, or excel yourself to be the management's favorite."
good,Low job security and jobs are currently being relocated to other development centers.  Love the company and the efforts they are undergoing to re-brand and build.
good,"Report KPIs and scorecard to management. Responsible for analyzing the forecast figures of several company projects. Work closely with account managers. Banks reconciliation, financial statements, accounts auditing. Collaboration in Payables department."
good,"Learned to enhance skill in production Oracle DBA support."
good,Learned many applications and tools during my career with Sabre and I am very grateful for that experience. Worked with external customers enabling to learn a lot about other cultures and company protocols.
good,"Stimulating work environment surrounded with smart people and flexibility to define the job. With downsides of poor work/life balance, stressful environment and constant reinventing of the business"
good,"Es un trabajo que no deja mucho margen the tiempo libre para otras actividades personales o para compartir con la familia. "
good,Blend of entrepreneurial and big company cultures.  Progressive with strong collaboration.  Ability to move to different types of jobs and assignments within and across business units.
good,"Get To work, open outlook. review all email and mark most important."
good,"Nice place to work and good team who collaborate with new team members. Cultural diversity, various business units to learn and have an option to move to those BU to learn about the whole company"
good,Its a good place to work. Its relaxed it gets hot inside those poles i have a cool manager thw schedule ia cool but youndont make enough money more cash would be great cant really live off what they pay
good,Very strong corporate leadership with primary focus on people and culture.  Environment is very fast-paced and the business landscape changes constantly.  Teams are very collaborative and globally separated so strong communication is paramount to success.
good,Co-workers at Sabre are fantastic.  Work/life balance can be minimal depending on your position.  Pay is not top grade.  The business operates on a very tight margin which tends to require layoffs about once a year.
good,"Nice team work. Good leadership. Nice benefits. "
good,good environment for working and the coligues are good persons ithis company definatley you will learn something. in this company culture is very good .
good,Sabre is a fast paced dynamic company. If you are interested in fast paced travel vertical Sabre is one of the industry leaders.  They deliver key services to many companies and it has remained profitable for many years.
good,"This a great company to develop your sales, marketing and distribution skills along providing excellence customer service"
good,Sabre is a great company and I would love to have a career with them. Unfortunately they were replacing a Senior program manager and will be hiring  senior human resources generalist.
good,"Good technology company and many benefits that offers an amazing cafeteria. Campus is in Southlake, Texas. Filling in more words because it is needed"
good,"Innovate to make travel easy!"
good,"Have flexibility and good work/life balance, challenges to be solved are unique for travel industry.  Recent transformation and bringing in new leaders from outside are de-motivating for mid-management there with no growth opportunities.  Outside of this, it's been a great company to work and grow up in past 12 years."
good,Professional yet chilled working environment. A lot of fun & everyone helps each other out when needed. Small Customer Service team & good managers. Clientele for the most part are great to deal with.
good,"Good people to work with.  International exposure within the travel industry.  New leadership taking the company in new directions.  Nice HQ campus, centrally located."
good,"Company was spun off from American Airlines when I worked there.  Rocky leadership early on, but became more stable during the second half of my tenure.  The company was sold to some private investors after I left and I heard the culture was not that great, but now it is a public company again.  Generally, a good company to work for with a solid brand."

good,"I worked in the evening,  We were an inbound call center for hotel reservations.  Typically most days started with doing the daily reports, tracking agent stats and then handling customer service issues from the overnight and daytime crews.  I was very customer service oriented so the harder ones would be saved for me.  I had a knack for deescalating irate customers.  I would also have to take inbound calls depending on how busy it was.  I spent time almost every day coaching and talking to agents.  I interfaced with our hotel customers as their main contact besides the account manager and trainer in our call center.  I was well liked and respected by them.  We had several groups in our call center.  We had very little turn over in my group and the longest tenured agents.  We also had, by far, the best attendance, as a group, in the call center.  There were 12 perfect attendance agents in the entire call center last year and 10 of them were in my group of 14 agents.  I wouldn't even miss work for ice storms and neither would most of my agents.  My group and I took immense pride in our attendance.  We had a really fun group.  Agents wanted to come to work.  We had a really good trainer in our group.  She was a lot of fun too.  We would take agents on that the other groups were ready to fire and make them into some of the most productive agents in the company.  Agents really wanted to transfer into our group.  I liked coming to work.  It was good to see everyone.  I think that was the best part.  We had a good management staff that made all of this possible.  It wasn't all fun."

L'un des principaux attraits des postes chez Sabre est l'autonomie laissée aux collaborateurs; en contrepartie le GDS est un domaine dans lequel la remise en question et la capacité à renouveler ses connaissances techniques sont incontournables, ce qui est motivant et captivant mais également un aspect très exigent de la profession."

There is no guarantee it will execute right on it but it still has enough cash generating part of the business that can help it get there if it executes right. It also needs to move from mostly air into more diversified supply marketplace. But, the vision of the executive team is fairly good, the time will tell if it is going to execute on it."

good,"Approving payment of invoices for the Sabre offices in the east. Communicating with Vice Presidents of several offices to resolve invoice related issues. When the disbursements department transitioned to the use of a company purchase card, I was instrumental in training the east coast office support staff in its use. Reducing the volume of paper invoices through the use of this PCard as well as purchase requisitions was a very rewarding part of this job. Being the go-to person for the support staff in the east offices was a welcome responsibility. Preparing appropriation requests was a bit challenging but extremely educational for me. I loved the experience."

good,"As Field Engineer, I supported voice and data equipment and networks for inbound calls for the American Airlines Reservation Center  located in San Antonio (SATRO) .  Upon arriving for work, I would clock in and initially check my daily employee communications requirements - email, tasks, quotas, etc.  Our office in the Comm Center provided administrative offices, a computer maintenance area and a TV/ break room.  We would respond to Reservation Agent complaints of telephone and/or terminal malfunctions.  If unable to complete an on the spot repair after troubleshooting, I would replace the defective components and returning the bad equipment to the workshop, continue troubleshooting, either completing the repair or identifying required replacement parts.  On quiet nights (no customer complaints-unusual but it DOES happen), I would work on other spare telephone systems/terminals to ensure an availability of spare units to swap out in response to agent complaints.   I performed periodic data backups of agent phone calls used to evaluate agent customer service performance and assist agent team leaders in resolving agent/customer conflicts."

There is not a single day, when I don’t learn anything new about the technology that I’m working on. Apart from technical knowledge and skills that I have gained while working here, I also got to know the work culture and how to work as a team. I am constantly being challenged to be a better developer, be inquisitive and innovative while keeping the ethics and values of the company intact. The job not only made me acquire new skills, but also made me a better professional. The job gives me exposure of meeting up with new people of different backgrounds, skills and talent which has made me a better person. I’m sure that I’ll be able to apply the knowledge and skills gained in all my future assignments, be it academic or professionally. It gave me confidence to handle other assignments successfully. The learning experience I gained here will help me even after I graduate"

good,"If you're in the right group, you'll find co-workers very willing to help each other to get the task at-hand completed. All team members are individual contributors and work their assigned tasks to a state as complete as possible, but when one runs into obstacles, he or she can count on fellow team mates to help."
good,"I did not work at Sabre long enough to determine how competitive the company is with promotions, compensation, or benefits. But judging from the culture, I imagine they are liberal with raises.

Supportive management and environment, completely open to all ethnicities and lifestyles!  Very creative.  The ONLY negative thing I will say is, at the level in management that I was, there wasn't an effort made to assist it relocating me within the company when lay-offs loomed.  The competition was crazy for the few openings available.  I lost out and was laid off after 18 years!"

I have learned a lot of (internal) customer service, Kronos app skills, work in team, and working with remote managers.

I do not know if it is difficult, but for sure needs a big responsability, to reach all time-frames in critical dates. The most enjoyable part is working with people from other countries."
good,"Some of the smartest, hardest working people I have worked with were at Sabre.  Also, some of the best managers I have had were at Sabre.  They encourage people to move from role to role after a couple years so people get experience in multiple areas of the company, which I think is a fantastic policy.  My only gripe is that they were really focused on MBAs and at one point I was told I would not be promoted any further unless I got an MBA.  I felt my experience was worth more than anything I would learn in an MBA program, but they were uncompromising."
